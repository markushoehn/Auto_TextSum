199	Nutrition appears to play a more significant role in disease
28	Good nutrition is of the utmost importance.
192	nutritionists and alternative healers insist that following the Feingold diet can lead to a significant reduction of ADHD symptoms.
217	eating properly can help lower the risk for many chronic diseases,
201	Eating a healthy, nutritious diet (e.g., decreasing junk food while increasing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats) can clearly benefit all children.
49	For children with demonstrated deficiencies of any nutrient (e.g., zinc, iron, magnesium, vitamins) , correction of that deficiency is the logical first-line treatment.
116	Essential fatty acids, such as fish oil or primrose oil may have some benefit for children with ADHD, but there is still a lot of research to be done.
193	Magnesium may also positively impact ADHD symptoms.
142	Protein is key, says Mitchell, because it can prevent surges in blood sugar, which may increase hyperactivity.
141	She finds that when her daughter eats a well-balanced ADD-friendly diet, including vegetables, carbohydrates, fruits, and plenty of protein, her behavior tends to be more consistently under control.

175	Due to the increasing popularity of alternative and complementary medicine concepts, people now have numerous choices in nontraditional approaches to personal health and wellness.
31	Alternative treatment is any treatment -- other than prescription medication or standard psychosocial/behavioral treatments -- that claims to treat the symptoms of ADHD with an equally or more effective outcome.
6	There are ADHD alternative treatments that you may use in addressing the problem of ADHD symptoms in your child.
181	alternatives to ADHD medication are also available,
195	For some people with ADHD, mild stimulants such as caffeine and theobromine (a bitter chemical from the cocoa plant and present in chocolate) have similar effects to the more powerful drugs
183	Caffeine is a mild CNS stimulant that can be used with ADHD children, teens, and adults, if used purposefully and in moderation.
196	caffeine can improve the function of children suffering from ADHD.
98	Physical activity may be good for focus.
172	Adding a routine of daily rigorous exercise may help mitigate restlessness, chronic boredom, and impulsivity, which are hallmark symptoms of ADHD in adults.
52	The rationale behind IM training is that motor planning and timing deficits are common in children with ADHD and are related to problems with behavioral inhibition that some experts believe are critical to understanding the disorder.
100	Exercise turns on the attention system, the so-called executive functions - sequencing, working memory, prioritizing, inhibiting, and sustaining attention,
218	exercise and physical activity are recommended as part of an overall healthy lifestyle.
207	Routine physical activity,
97	The latest news about exercise is that it helps kids push through past failures and attack things they did n't succeed at before.
99	Team activities or exercise with a social component are especially beneficial.
102	That same burst of activity also elevates the brain 's dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin levels.
103	kids realize they can regulate their mood and attention through exercise,
101	Rat studies show that exercise reduces learned helplessness.
198	Herbal supplements such as ginkgo biloba have also been used to treat the symptoms of ADHD.
13	Nutritional and herbal supplements are also used in treating ADHD.
129	Homeopathy uses combinations of plant, animal or mineral extracts as remedies.

69	Attend is a powerful, all-natural treatment choice that is Clinically Tested with computerized testing, in addition to parent reports.
209	Attend is also effective.
78	ATTEND takes about 30-60 days to become effective.
157	ATTEND helps 70 % to be more focused, to get their work done, and to think more clearly.
67	Computerized Testing showed over 70 % improved with Attend in just 30 days,
68	Parent Rating Scales reported 80 % improved in 30 days.
211	chart comparing Ritalin to ATTEND and to EEG Biofeedback treatment
127	No studies have shown that homeopathy works in treating ADHD.
30	Known to reduce restlessness and over-excitability, this homeopathic remedy showed positive results in a controlled study conducted in 1997.
64	Several homeopathic studies have also been conducted on ADHD children (Lamont, 1997) and statistically significant improvement have been shown.
15	most of these natural remedies for ADHD probably will not effectively control the symptoms of ADD.
122	Herbs can be calming, and some studies show they may play a role in memory and thinking, but none have been proven to help with the main symptoms of ADHD.
124	Blue-green algae can cause stomach upset, weakness, numbness and tingling.
29	Try an alternative treatment for ADHD such as natural herbal remedies before you turn to prescription medication.
66	hypnosis is not a very effective means of controlling ADHD
65	Hypnosis has little to no effect on the core symptoms of ADHD.
138	brainwave biofeedback training might also be very helpful.
7	Biofeedback is a recognized method of treating ADHD.
182	EEG Biofeedback training.
118	Studies on whether biofeedback works have been done using very small groups of children and results are not clear.
223	biofeedback treatments can be expensive.
8	The effectiveness of this alternative treatment has been attested by many parents and by some published studies.
117	Biofeedback claims to help people control their own responses.
10	Auditory stimulation is another alternative method of ADHD treatment.
11	Children are made to listen to music, preferably classical music, while performing a task.
12	Still another alternative method of treating ADHD is the interactive metronome approach.
21	Interactive Metronome and Musical Therapy utilizes sound feedback to improve attention span and focusing ability.
14	Other alternative treatments include chiropractic care, antimotion sickness medications, candida yeast treatment, and cerebellar training.
57	Advocates of this approach believe that imbalance of muscle tone can cause an imbalance of brain activity, and that spinal adjustments as well as other somatosensory stimulation, such as exposure to varying frequencies of light and sound, can effectively treat ADHD and learning disabilities.
58	Treatment consists of restoring the cranial bones to the proper position through specific bodily manipulations.
224	Some chiropractors believe that chiropractic medicine (therapy that adjusts the spinal column to treat illnesses) is better than medical treatments for ADHD.
225	No scientific studies prove that chiropractic helps with symptoms of this brain disorder.
59	No research has been done to support the effectiveness of chiropractic approaches for the treatment of ADHD.
208	Treating ADHD requires a good deal of effort and money.
169	Alternative remedies are used in place of traditional medicines and complementary remedies are used in addition to traditional treatments.
4	Sometimes people look for treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that they hope will work together with -- or even instead of -- their doctor 's treatments.

221	Sensory Integration Training Integration means combining or blending.
222	Some studies found this training helpful with ADHD movement and timing problems, but other studies did not.
147	Neurofeedback training is an alternative treatment sometimes used to treat ADHD, and other conditions.
36	Her mother turned to neurofeedback, an alternative ADHD treatment that uses brain exercises to reduce impulsivity and increase attentiveness.
56	Neurofeedback (EEG Biofeedback) EEG biofeedback -- also referred to as neurofeedback -- is an intervention for ADHD that is based on findings that many individuals with ADHD show low levels of arousal in frontal brain areas.
77	EEG Biofeedback, or Neurofeedback training, was about 70-75 % effective
41	Some symptoms of ADHD - impulsivity, distractibility, and acting out - diminish.
43	After Richard received nine months of neurofeedback, his teacher reports that he is now more focused and rarely gets frustrated.
38	"Monastra 's results indicate that  patients who did not receive the therapy lost most of the positive effects of treatment one week after they were taken off medication."""
40	after the year of neurofeedback therapy, some patients were able to reduce medication dosage by about 50 percent.
39	Those who combined medication with neurofeedback, he says, maintained their ability to control attention.
42	The goal of neurofeedback is to teach the patient to produce the brain-wave patterns associated with focus.
154	Hypnosis could help as an alternative ADD/ADHD treatment.
125	Hypnotherapy might help with some common ADHD symptoms.
155	Hypnosis can give a person with ADD/ADHD the feeling of being in charge of his behavior,

62	There is no scientific support for any theory claiming specific ocular exercises or coloured lens can alleviate ADHD
63	no evidence to support anecdotal reports of improvements in ADHD symptoms after introducing prismatic lenses
134	The key is always being aware of where your attention is focused while you are engaged in routine activities.
135	Mindful awareness, or mindfulness, is part of many religious traditions.
110	Reiki can be extremely helpful with ADHD as it can help quiet your mind, and assist with [finding] clarity and direction in your life.
111	Unlike hypnosis, another alternative healing method, there is no direct instruction to think -- or not think -- about anything in particular.
137	Researchers have talked about using mindfulness for ADHD for some time, but the question was always whether people with ADHD could really do it, especially if they 're hyperactive.
136	Mindful awareness can also make people more aware of their emotional state, so they wo n't react impulsively.
204	The use of light and sound stimulation (alpha/theta wave) to guide and change brainwave patterns has also been touted as helpful for reducing ADHD symptoms,
205	Advocates suggest that increasing the stimulation frequency of the alpha/theta wave improves cognitive functioning and reduces symptoms caused by slow brainwaves.

protection , abuse and inhuman treatment
114	Learners should be protected from abuse by adults or other learners.
99	Inhuman treatment is defined by any action that causes a bodily or emotional shock to a child, such as hitting or pushing, or inflicting any punishment that causes damage to the child, using or without the intermediary of an object, weapon or abusive physical force.
32	It also warns against the use of strategies of humiliation and neglect in place of corporal punishment, which are also unacceptable.
231	Corporal punishment can violate children 's rights to freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, to education, and to freedom from physical violence.
468	"Corporal punishment that results in bruising, marking or other injury lasting longer than a 24-hour period may be deemed to be  unreasonable '' and thus classified as physical abuse."""
469	Corporal punishment that is unreasonable in the circumstances may lead to intervention by police and/or child protection authorities.
471	"Punishment that is  unreasonable '' (e.g., punishment that causes harm to a child that lasts for more than a short period) may be classified as physical abuse and could lead to intervention by police and/or child protection authorities."""
470	the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) establishes that corporal punishment is unreasonable if the force is applied to any part of the head or neck of a child or to any other part of the body of a child in such a way as to be likely to cause harm to a child that lasts for more than a short period.
81	child abuse is a felony in most of the United States.
70	Society must break the cycle of abuse by banning all forms of corporal punishment.
5	The Catholic Church teaches that violence against another person in any form fails to treat that person as someone worthy of love.
221	Students must be taught in an environment that clearly states they are valued and understood.
87	Intentionally striking a child with a wooden board in most circumstances constitutes the offense of assault and battery.
132	Any reference to giving corporal punishment to a child is to doing anything for the purpose of punishing that child (whether or not there are other reasons for doing it) which, apart from any justification, would constitute battery.
655	If the victim of the alleged sexual harassment is a minor student and if the alleged harassment falls within the definition of abuse as found in Board 's policy JGCE, Child Abuse and Neglect, then all school employees with knowledge shall be considered mandatory reporters and the allegations must be reported to child protection or law enforcement as provided by state law and the Board policy on child abuse.

treatment
358	Your child can have a normal life and excellent health.
370	Before your child undergoes any medical treatment, it is critical for you to have a full understanding of the diagnosis, procedure and options available.
194	Overweight children may be referred to a dietitian while obese children may need treatment at a specialist obesity clinic.
360	The ill effects of childhood obesity can be mitigated with enough determination and commitment.
406	A new toolkit was recently released to help these local policymakers adopt long-term, sustainable, and holistic approaches toward solving the childhood obesity epidemic crisis.
207	Controversial treatments - such as using medications intended for purposes other than weight loss, and exercise programs that minimize the importance of cardiovascular activity in favor of strength training - have been gaining attention.
325	In treating most overweight children, the main emphasis should be to prevent weight gain above what 's appropriate for expected increases in height.
313	The only long-term strategy in the country 's fight against obesity is to fix it at source - focussing on the year [s] before/during pregnancy, birth and the child 's very early years.
66	Children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital, where they can be given 24-hour care for several weeks or months.
269	Diets that focus on eliminating specific nutrients have not been studied extensively in children.
73	Dieting appears to be causally linked to both obesity and eating disorders and dieting also increases risk of binge eating, cycles of weight regain and loss, reduced self-esteem, food and body preoccupation, weight stigma, and future weight gain.
131	They find diet choices confusing, and being different when it comes to picking out foods in the cafeteria can be an ordeal.
327	Reaching and maintaining an appropriate body weight is important.
323	Highly restrictive diets that forbid favorite foods are likely to fail.
12	parents that attempt to limit food (s) may actually promote increased preference and consumption of the limited food (s) in children.
333	Showing children healthy eating habits by having a balanced diet and active lifestyle yourself are very important when trying to develop children 's own healthy routines.
74	Within two years, 95 per cent of people who go on weight-loss diets, including commercial diets, regain all the weight they lost, plus more,
271	A child 's diet should be analyzed, with particular attention to the amount of juice and soft drink consumption, frequency of eating outside the home, school lunches, portion sizes, and snacking.
441	The diets of kids are atrocious.
365	Most nutrition experts and dietitians say that children of any age -- even infants -- can safely follow a vegetarian diet, according to the Nemours Foundation.
302	A diet that promotes normal body weight includes fresh fruit, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates.
267	Treatment can be implemented through a primary care doctor or a structured weight control program.
435	The authors conclude that the experimental approach resulted in many parental benefits, making this programme ideal for treatment of obesity in children and their overweight parents.
382	treatment for obesity is unlikely to succeed if we deal only with the child and not with the child 's prevailing environment;
