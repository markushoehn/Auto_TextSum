The idea of removing sugars, food coloring and other additives from the diet as a treatment for ADHD remains one of the most popular alternative treatments for the disorder.Hyperactivity has long been associated with sugary sodas and cheeks full of candy.Several studies have suggested that artificial food coloring and sugar may cause increased hyperactivity in some children with ADHD.In preschool children, there may be a weak association between sugar and ADHD-like symptoms.Controlled studies - the ones that compare kids who are on and off sugar - have n't found any link to attention or behavior in school-age children.Not everybody responds well to medication, or biofeedback, or diet, or Attend.Every child is different and will respond as an individual to the treatment optionsWith treatment, children with ADHD are better able to live with and manage their symptoms.natural '' does not necessarily mean harmless."Natural '' does not necessarily mean  Safe.""""the FDA has warned consumers to watch out for  fraudulent '' dietary supplements, which claim to be for particular purposes but may contain harmful ingredients."""Always talk to your doctor first before beginning any natural treatment regimen for your condition.Always tell your doctor about any herbal products or nutritional supplements that you may be using.Patients should exercise caution when trying a natural remedy for their ADD.vitamins, herbs, and other treatments can cause problems with your other medications.People with ADHD have individual treatment needs.(No one treatment works for everyone.ADHD treatments range from diet restrictions to herbal products; EEG to video games."When it comes to the treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder - ADD ADHD - or with problems of Attention, Impulse Control, Over-Activity, and/or Learning Problems in  the real world, '' there are a number of approaches to treatment that may work well."""No treatment works for everyone.a treatment may be known to help children with ADHD, but it may be effective for only a minority of the ADHD population and the specific subgroup it is effective for is not clearly defined.Although there are several effective treatments, they are not equally effective for all children with ADHD."Prescription medication and standard psychosocial/behavioral treatments have been  extensively and well reviewed in the extant literature, with undoubted efficacy."""Medication is by far the most proven, safe, and effective treatment for ADHD.ADHD drugs are safe and effective,ampakines do not seem to have unpleasant, long-lasting side effectsRitalin is very effective.medication for ADHD remains a controversial topic.traditional medicines and adult ADHD treatments represent the best and most effective way to treat adult ADHD.Drugs do n't improve self-esteem, time management, or organizational skills.Two small studies showed a reduction in inattention and hyperactivity symptoms after a program of glyconutritional supplements,ADHD medications may bring about the onset of side effects which may be harmful to the ADHD patient 's health.Many parents are concerned about the risk of giving their children powerful psychoactive medicationsValerian, sometimes used to help with sleep problems and anxiety, can cause headaches.Many prescription medications are stimulant based and may cause significant side effects.Some kids simply can not tolerate any stimulant, no matter how low the dosage.Children taking stimulant medication, however, should be monitored closely for significant weight loss.there are concerns about the drugs ' potential to increase cardiac risks.Multimodal treatment includes medications, behavioral therapy, school programs and accommodations, and education of children and families about the disorder, which helps with the unwanted behavior that comes from ADHD symptoms.Multimodal treatment for children and adolescents with ADHD consists of parent and child education about diagnosis and treatment, behavior management techniques, medication, and school programming and supports.The goal is to incrementally teach children new ways of behaving by rewarding desired behavior, such as following directions, and eliminating undesired actions, such as losing homework,Some preliminary studies suggest that deficiencies of certain nutrients, including iron, zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6, are associated with ADHD-like symptoms - and that, in these instances, correcting the deficiency might help curb symptoms.A complementary treatment is added to usual treatment with the hope of even better control of ADHD symptoms.there is convincing scientific evidence that some children who display symptoms of ADHD can derive significant benefits from appropriate dietary treatmentsFood can play a role in exacerbating, or keeping under control, symptoms of ADHD.While this daily treat may make people suffering from the disorder feel happy and more relaxed, resulting in sharper focus and reduced restlessness, it does not address the underlying cause of the condition.being sensitive to certain foods can cause symptoms of ADHD.There is no scientific evidence that vitamin supplements help to treat ADHD.Iron supplementation has been associated with improvements in parent behavior ratings for ADHD boys,If you are combining Ritalin with improved nutrition, there is no risk of injury and you may actually help your child.Some people think diet supplements improve symptoms of ADHD.Scientists have found no proof of this idea.Nutrition appears to play a more significant role in diseaseGood nutrition is of the utmost importance.nutritionists and alternative healers insist that following the Feingold diet can lead to a significant reduction of ADHD symptoms.eating properly can help lower the risk for many chronic diseases,Eating a healthy, nutritious diet (e.g., decreasing junk food while increasing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats) can clearly benefit all children.For children with demonstrated deficiencies of any nutrient (e.g., zinc, iron, magnesium, vitamins) , correction of that deficiency is the logical first-line treatment.Essential fatty acids, such as fish oil or primrose oil may have some benefit for children with ADHD, but there is still a lot of research to be done.Magnesium may also positively impact ADHD symptoms.Protein is key, says Mitchell, because it can prevent surges in blood sugar, which may increase hyperactivity.She finds that when her daughter eats a well-balanced ADD-friendly diet, including vegetables, carbohydrates, fruits, and plenty of protein, her behavior tends to be more consistently under control.Changes in diet may help a small group of children who have allergies, food sensitivities or who suffer from migraine headaches.Most doctors seem to think that nutrition does not cause or control ADHD.Dietary interventions are difficult to impose and unlikely to bring any benefit.Whether or not this treatment actually positively affects individuals with ADHD remains to be seen.Promising initial results using several types of mineral supplements have also been reported.Due to the increasing popularity of alternative and complementary medicine concepts, people now have numerous choices in nontraditional approaches to personal health and wellness.Alternative treatment is any treatment -- other than prescription medication or standard psychosocial/behavioral treatments -- that claims to treat the symptoms of ADHD with an equally or more effective outcome.There are ADHD alternative treatments that you may use in addressing the problem of ADHD symptoms in your child.alternatives to ADHD medication are also available,For some people with ADHD, mild stimulants such as caffeine and theobromine (a bitter chemical from the cocoa plant and present in chocolate) have similar effects to the more powerful drugsCaffeine is a mild CNS stimulant that can be used with ADHD children, teens, and adults, if used purposefully and in moderation.caffeine can improve the function of children suffering from ADHD.Physical activity may be good for focus.Adding a routine of daily rigorous exercise may help mitigate restlessness, chronic boredom, and impulsivity, which are hallmark symptoms of ADHD in adults.The rationale behind IM training is that motor planning and timing deficits are common in children with ADHD and are related to problems with behavioral inhibition that some experts believe are critical to understanding the disorder.Exercise turns on the attention system, the so-called executive functions - sequencing, working memory, prioritizing, inhibiting, and sustaining attention,exercise and physical activity are recommended as part of an overall healthy lifestyle.Routine physical activity,The latest news about exercise is that it helps kids push through past failures and attack things they did n't succeed at before.Team activities or exercise with a social component are especially beneficial.That same burst of activity also elevates the brain 's dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin levels.kids realize they can regulate their mood and attention through exercise,Rat studies show that exercise reduces learned helplessness.Herbal supplements such as ginkgo biloba have also been used to treat the symptoms of ADHD.Nutritional and herbal supplements are also used in treating ADHD.Homeopathy uses combinations of plant, animal or mineral extracts as remedies.Attend is an over-the-counter homeopathic nutraceutical treatment - ADHD alternative medicine.Attend is a powerful, all-natural treatment choice that is Clinically Tested with computerized testing, in addition to parent reports.Attend is also effective.ATTEND takes about 30-60 days to become effective.ATTEND helps 70 % to be more focused, to get their work done, and to think more clearly.Computerized Testing showed over 70 % improved with Attend in just 30 days,Parent Rating Scales reported 80 % improved in 30 days.chart comparing Ritalin to ATTEND and to EEG Biofeedback treatmentNo studies have shown that homeopathy works in treating ADHD.Known to reduce restlessness and over-excitability, this homeopathic remedy showed positive results in a controlled study conducted in 1997.Several homeopathic studies have also been conducted on ADHD children (Lamont, 1997) and statistically significant improvement have been shown.most of these natural remedies for ADHD probably will not effectively control the symptoms of ADD.Herbs can be calming, and some studies show they may play a role in memory and thinking, but none have been proven to help with the main symptoms of ADHD.Blue-green algae can cause stomach upset, weakness, numbness and tingling.Try an alternative treatment for ADHD such as natural herbal remedies before you turn to prescription medication.hypnosis is not a very effective means of controlling ADHDHypnosis has little to no effect on the core symptoms of ADHD.brainwave biofeedback training might also be very helpful.Biofeedback is a recognized method of treating ADHD.EEG Biofeedback training.Studies on whether biofeedback works have been done using very small groups of children and results are not clear.biofeedback treatments can be expensive.The effectiveness of this alternative treatment has been attested by many parents and by some published studies.Biofeedback claims to help people control their own responses.Auditory stimulation is another alternative method of ADHD treatment.Children are made to listen to music, preferably classical music, while performing a task.Still another alternative method of treating ADHD is the interactive metronome approach.Interactive Metronome and Musical Therapy utilizes sound feedback to improve attention span and focusing ability.Other alternative treatments include chiropractic care, antimotion sickness medications, candida yeast treatment, and cerebellar training.Advocates of this approach believe that imbalance of muscle tone can cause an imbalance of brain activity, and that spinal adjustments as well as other somatosensory stimulation, such as exposure to varying frequencies of light and sound, can effectively treat ADHD and learning disabilities.Treatment consists of restoring the cranial bones to the proper position through specific bodily manipulations.Some chiropractors believe that chiropractic medicine (therapy that adjusts the spinal column to treat illnesses) is better than medical treatments for ADHD.No scientific studies prove that chiropractic helps with symptoms of this brain disorder.No research has been done to support the effectiveness of chiropractic approaches for the treatment of ADHD.Treating ADHD requires a good deal of effort and money.Alternative remedies are used in place of traditional medicines and complementary remedies are used in addition to traditional treatments.Sometimes people look for treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that they hope will work together with -- or even instead of -- their doctor 's treatments.Several programs combining balance, coordination, eye and sensory exercises that specifically involve the functions of the cerebellum are used to treat ADHD,behavior therapy regimen can be developed by a pediatrician or a school psychologist or another mental-health worker.does not require a prescription,average course of treatment can range from $ 2,000 to $ 5,000.Sensory Integration Training Integration means combining or blending.Some studies found this training helpful with ADHD movement and timing problems, but other studies did not.Neurofeedback training is an alternative treatment sometimes used to treat ADHD, and other conditions.Her mother turned to neurofeedback, an alternative ADHD treatment that uses brain exercises to reduce impulsivity and increase attentiveness.Neurofeedback (EEG Biofeedback) EEG biofeedback -- also referred to as neurofeedback -- is an intervention for ADHD that is based on findings that many individuals with ADHD show low levels of arousal in frontal brain areas.EEG Biofeedback, or Neurofeedback training, was about 70-75 % effectiveSome symptoms of ADHD - impulsivity, distractibility, and acting out - diminish.After Richard received nine months of neurofeedback, his teacher reports that he is now more focused and rarely gets frustrated."Monastra 's results indicate that  patients who did not receive the therapy lost most of the positive effects of treatment one week after they were taken off medication."""after the year of neurofeedback therapy, some patients were able to reduce medication dosage by about 50 percent.Those who combined medication with neurofeedback, he says, maintained their ability to control attention.The goal of neurofeedback is to teach the patient to produce the brain-wave patterns associated with focus.Hypnosis could help as an alternative ADD/ADHD treatment.Hypnotherapy might help with some common ADHD symptoms.Hypnosis can give a person with ADD/ADHD the feeling of being in charge of his behavior,"There is  no systematic data on optometric training for ADHD despite its widespread use."""There is no scientific support for any theory claiming specific ocular exercises or coloured lens can alleviate ADHDno evidence to support anecdotal reports of improvements in ADHD symptoms after introducing prismatic lensesThe key is always being aware of where your attention is focused while you are engaged in routine activities.Mindful awareness, or mindfulness, is part of many religious traditions.Reiki can be extremely helpful with ADHD as it can help quiet your mind, and assist with [finding] clarity and direction in your life.Unlike hypnosis, another alternative healing method, there is no direct instruction to think -- or not think -- about anything in particular.Researchers have talked about using mindfulness for ADHD for some time, but the question was always whether people with ADHD could really do it, especially if they 're hyperactive.Mindful awareness can also make people more aware of their emotional state, so they wo n't react impulsively.The use of light and sound stimulation (alpha/theta wave) to guide and change brainwave patterns has also been touted as helpful for reducing ADHD symptoms,Advocates suggest that increasing the stimulation frequency of the alpha/theta wave improves cognitive functioning and reduces symptoms caused by slow brainwaves.Leading experts and ADHD researchers know of no natural cure for ADHD.Experts do not know whether supplementary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or eicosapentaneoic acid (EPA) offers any benefits as a natural ADD treatment.children with ADHD have low levels of EPA and DHA,no evidence suggests a link between a high sugar diet and a child 's development of ADHDResearch has also shown that the simple elimination of sugar or candy does not affect ADHD symptoms, despite a few encouraging reports.Sugar or candy restriction alone is not an effective treatment for ADHD in children or adults.there is little evidence that a diet without sugar or additives help with the symptoms of ADHD.No definitive, empirical data exists proving the efficacy and reliability of natural remedies as a treatment for adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.More scientific research is necessary before experts will consider any of these adult ADHD natural remedies as safe and effective.While numerous studies indicate that adding zinc supplements reduces hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, they also show it as causing no improvement in attention span.Essential fatty acid supplementation has promising systematic case-control data but needs more research."Arnold describes 24 such treatments in a recent article titled  Alternative Treatments for Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,"""A few of the alternatives proposed have been demonstrated to be probably ineffective or possibly dangerous,we have found that stimulants, and other prescription drugs, are not the only effective interventions for ADHD.Controversial treatments are interventions with no known published science supporting them and no legitimate claim to effectiveness.Alternative and complementary treatments usually are n't carefully tested or judged by a group of experts.there are no alternative treatments for which comparable empirical support exists.Some alternative treatments look promising but lack sufficient research.Some alternative treatments of ADHD are effective or probably effective, but mainly for specific subgroups.Two ADD alternative treatments that show promise in increasing children 's attention and focusing abilities include biologic and auditory feedback.lack of independent researchStudy results report that St. John 's Wort is not an effective natural treatment for ADHD in adults.Many of the alternative treatments are completely safe.Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD affects 3-5 % of all children.Attention Deficit '' impacts about 5 % of children and teenagers, and about 3 % of all adults.It is a genetic condition that affects an estimated five percent of U.S. children,ADHD is one of the most common childhood behavior disorders.Of all children referred to mental health professionals about 35 % are referred for ADHD, more than for any other condition.About 5 percent of school-age children have ADHD.There are 2 million kids with ADHD,ADHD is difficult to diagnose.A lot of teenagers, and even children, are prescribed antidepressants, somewhere from 1 % to 1.5 % of the population."Less than half of children with ADD ever  out-grow '' it in adolescence or adulthood."""If untreated, the disorder can have long-term adverse effects into adolescence and adulthood.Children with untreated ADHD have higher than normal rates of school problems, social problems, and even injury.thyroid hormone syndrome appears extremely rare in ADHD.Sometimes children who have thyroid disorders also have problems with attention and hyperactive behavior.Thyroid disorders in children with ADHD are rare.In children with thyroid dysfunction, the thyroid status seems related to attention and hyper-active-impulsive systems.85 percent of these adults remain undiagnosed, leading to difficulties with family and other relationships and educational and employment problems.ADHD is a brain-based disorder where the chemistry of the brain (neurotransmitters) is not functioning as it should.Some believe that toxins produced by the yeast overgrowth weaken the immune system and make the body susceptible to ADHD and other psychiatric disorders.Iron levels tend to be low in individuals with ADHD.Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a childhood disorder linked with attention problems, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.While the symptoms of hyperactivity generally decrease with age as the brain matures, other symptoms tend to persist, and it is not uncommon for ADHD-associated impairments to continue through the teenage years and into adulthood.Those with ADHD often have problems in most areas of their life, including home, school, work, and in relationships.ADHD can affect behaviour so much that functioning on a daily basis becomes difficult.For some it severely impacts behavior, and for others it greatly impacts learning.If your Child has ADHD, he or she needs your help, guidance and understanding.when a child 's impulsivity, hyperactivity or inability to concentrate begins to affect his performance at school or his relationship with family and friends, then professional help is needed.Unless the task is very stimulating, like a video game or TV program or outside playing, those with attention disorders are often easily bored by a task - especially bored by homework, math tests, balancing checkbooks, or doing taxes, and many of these tasks just never get done.Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, also known as ADHD, is a condition that runs in families.Diet is often part of the problem.recent research suggests a possible relationship between ADHD and the foods one consumes.Some kids seems very sensitive to food additives or food colorings, or to sodas, or to cow 's milk, or to sugars paired with carbohydrates.Some kids seem to have real ups and downs with their blood sugar levels.A lack of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids may contribute to dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,Some research has shown that people with ADHD have insufficient amounts of zinc in their bodies.ADHD is n't caused by an allergic reaction to food, or anything in food, including additives.The deficiency as a cause of ADHD without other symptoms has not been demonstrated.studies show that a placebo is actually effective, when measured by parent rating scales, with about 15 % of children with ADHD.These tests are not impacted at all by placebos."If you struggle too long without a break, you experience a condition that might be called  attention fatigue."""The greener the setting, the better the ability to focuskids ' focus was better following outdoor activities than after indoor activities,A study of healthy kids in public housing found that those who lived in apartments with a relatively green view had better impulse control than those with barren views.when you have to struggle to maintain attention - what happens when you concentrate on a task like writing or doing computations - neurotransmitters in the brain 's prefrontal cortex get depleted.Results can vary from patient to patient so its important that you monitor and work with your doctor.Do not use gingko biloba for children with a blood clotting problem.never embark on any new exercise routine without first consulting your doctor.Consult with a physician if you decide to supplement with iron.Talk to your doctor before trying any alternative therapy for your child 's ADHD.the most important advances in ADHD medications have been the with the improvement of, and greater variety of the delivery systems of the time tested drugs for ADHD.Over the past ten years the greatest advances in ADHD medicines have not been the development of some wonder drug, though some good medications have been developed.Dr. Arnold could not find any systematic data for using pycnogenol for treating ADHD,Controlled trials of all of these approaches are lacking,No systematic data regarding ADHD efficacy could be found for hypericum, Gingko biloba, Calmplex, Defendol, or pycnogenol.Ampakines are a new class of modified benzamide compounds known to enhance attention span and alertness.Anatomically and physiologically, there is no reason to believe that the inner ear system is involved in attention and impulse-control other than in marginal ways.SI therapy is not a treatment for ADHD but some children with ADHD may have SI dysfunction.

Brandon Gonzales, 12, has been using a cellphone since he was 10.More than eight in 10 teenagers have cellphones, and more than half have had them since they were 12 years old or younger.Now about 85 % of kids under 17 and 61 % of kids from 10 to 13 have a cellphone.It 's only been just under two years, but mobile technology use amongst children has increased rapidly.The bulk of teens are 12 or 13 when they get their first cell phone - but remember this applies to teens who are 17 now and got their phones five years ago, as well as current 13 year olds who have had a phone for six months.Over the last decade, the age of kids packing their first cellphone has been dialing back younger and younger.46 % Of children receive their first cellphone at age 12 or 13;Tweens children from ages 8 to 12 are the new frontier for the cellphone industry."More than half of the  tween '' population will be wireless users by 2010,"""somewhere between nine and twelve is when most kids nowadays get their phones.Studies have shown that children who use cellphones before the age of 20 have a greater risk of developing cancer than adults.Another project, called Cefalo, is under way in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland to explore whether mobile telephone use increases the risk of brain tumors for children.Some studies, using computer image modelling, show signals radiate farther into children 's heads than adults.Because the rate of cellular growth is so much higher in children than in younger adult groups any indication of increased risk for younger adult groups suggests that the risk of cellphone use by children may be higher yet.Children also had more fluid in their brains than adults.The Mobile Telecommunication and Health Research Program in Britain, which is financed by the state and local telecommunications industry, is in the early stage of organizing a children s study."Cellphones, says another internal memo  have been linked to increasing incidence of childhood leukemia, brain and other cancers of the head and neck, memory problems, stress and migraine/neurological ailment."""The best thing parents can do is educate, educate, educate,For parents, it 's a balancing act that takes practice.Since today 's bullies often make use of cellphones, email and social media, students need to be taught how to use these powerful communication tools safely, with respect, dignity and awareness.When you hand a phone to a kid, you have to affirmatively take control,On the positive side, some kiddie cell phones have parental controls."She can only call or text the people in her contact list (which I control) and she signed a  contract '' I made up with a list of rules and expectations and consequences should those be violated."""You can control everything from who they call and when they can use their phone.Many families say they are careful to create rules about how and when their children can use their phones.Next time I observe my children overly focused on their cells, I 'll send them a text message: Put the phone away.Program everyone 's numbers into their phones so they display the caller 's name.Knowing how distracting cellphones can be, she and her husband set some ground rules: No phones at the dinner table or while out to eat with family.Insist that your children use a cellphone appropriately."Discuss the dangers of  sexting '' (sending sexually explicit photos by cellphone) and cyberbullying (sending intimidating, harassing messages)"""Please do not get your young children a phone with a camera.Thirty-nine kids (2.5 percent) said they appeared in or created images that involved semi-nudity or near-nudity."The 10-year-old boy who sent a girl a cellphone picture of his penis to  gross her out '' was n't arrested."""Kiddie cell phones will enable child predators to contact children without their parents ' knowledge"Concerns over teenage  sexting '' -- sending suggestive or explicit images by cellphone or online -- might be overblown, new research finds."""i think a good age for a kid to get a cellphone is when they get into middle school or as a present for they 're fifth grade graduation!My dad is the only reason I do n't have one, so my age is when you should give your child a phone.i dont think people should wait until their kids are thirteen for them to buy thier kids a cell phone.Cellphones did not exist in the early period but were introduced at the beginning (1981) of the late period when the striking rise in acoustic neuromas also began.Some argue that the change in the number of acoustic neuromas reflects, instead of the introduction of cellphones, the introduction of better diagnostic tools; specifically CT scans which began in 1974, and MRI scans, first used in 1984.The main con is the relation between exposure to radiation and susceptibility to brain tumors in later life.In December, Telef nica, which helped develop the MO1 and a more sophisticated version for young children, the Win1, announced a code of conduct for responsible use of mobile telephones by young customers.They have also urged the cellphone industry to refrain from marketing their products to children - a widespread practice in North America where phones ' cartoonish images lure youngsters.experts felt that the only way to counter the ' overstimulation ' of the brain brought on by the latest technology was sleep.Any business that markets or sells products to kids needs to be aware of the role of these CE devices in their lives,You hear many teachers complain today of children using cellphones for texting in classrooms; well, there is a simple solution to that.(Children are not allowed to have a cellphone with them on the camp.Many are creating school policies governing cellphone use, like those in place at middle and high schools, where cellphones are more common.Cellphones are not permitted because they can be disruptive in class.There are phones in every room at the school that they can use if they are staying after school or need something.Teachers should have the authority to take the cellphone and hold it for a period of time (punishment) if a student is found to use it in the class, the parents should be called and informed.Only 23 percent of those whose kids have cellphones think their children are using them during school, while 65 percent of kids say they useWhen phones are Web-enabled, parents are often surprised by the size of the phone bill.Kids do not need phones with internet capabilities.It doese n't matter if you can PAY for it, it 's what happens once you GET it.Parents can set monthly allowances, which Kajeet says will help them teach kids about budgeting.In a world where we 're community is linked by phones, I do n't have oneU.K. health officials publicly discouraged the non-essential use of cellphones by children four years ago.Considering how much dirty stuff goes around on the cell phones of teens these days (especially from girls) , I personally do not think it is appropriate for a child under the age of 16 to own a phone.She and her husband have shot down their 11-year-old son 's request for one because they think he 's too young.It just matters if your kid is ready to handle it.Can he/she be trusted to care for a phone?Should it be used for games, Internet access, texting/chatting with friends?I would also suggest that cordless telephones and Wi-Fi and wireless games should be included in their recommendations for avoidance by children, and that these devices should not be used in close proximity to children,Will it be used mainly for emergencies or keeping in touch with parents/family?i think its really important for a younger child to have a phone especially in today 's day and age."Many parents see mobile phones for kids as a way to  parent on the go, '' to extend their oversight and remotely cover scheduling gaps."""Occasionally, Jack forgets to text message from the bus, leading his mom to call the school in a panic to make sure he 's there.He does n't need it till he starts having after school activities.When they are teens, we give them cellphones so they 're never far from our help or advice.Children can get lost or get kidnapped and in these cases a cellphone is surely a great device.a phone with parental controls and limited features, coupled with clear rules about phone use, could be a good tool for families,Wherify, a phone that lets parents know (as in verify) exactly where their child is located at any point in time."With these phones school-aged children ( tweens '') get naturalized to mobile phones."""This phone also works great for punish and reward systems.The cost is reasonable at $ 15 a month for about 150 minutes of use.So it 's teaching her to budget time and not be on the phone too much.Parents also complain to her about their children texting under their covers at night.About two-thirds of 8 - to 18-year-olds have their own cellphone, and about half of them send text messages on any given day, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation study.He has seen cases of tendonitis in kids caused by persistent texting.With televisions, computers, cellphones, school work and extracurricular activities, parents worry that their kids are so busy that they are n't getting enough sleep.Kids who text estimate sending an average of 118 messages a day.In France the health minister, Roselyne Bachelot, has taken such concerns public, issuing an alert in January urging parents to limit use, reducing children s telephone calls to no more than six minutes.Kids spend an average of seven hours and 38 minutes a day using media, up an hour and 19 minutes since just 1999,Kids are using more advanced mobile devices than even their parents, They 're adept.

children should not be discriminated against based on their special education label;Concerned about violence and other problems in their schools, students across Philadelphia are taking matters into their own hands.students have been taking steps to improve their schools ' climates and reduce the tension that leads to aggressive behavior - before it becomes a problem.students with disabilities are more likely to be the victims of violence than perpetrators;there are some significant differences in the perceptions held by students, teachers and administrators about school violence.The disruption caused by violence in our nation 's public elementary and secondary schools is a national concern.Schools where serious violent crimes were reported were more likely to employ metal detectors than those with less serious crime only or no crimestudents were not satisfied with the responses from school staff to violence and misbehaviour.instead of the problem behaviour of vandalism and smoking we now talk of violence, weapons, gangs, and drugs/alcohol.Research needs to determine if violence is a step-by-step continuum or if there is a direct pathway to serious offenses.City schools, however, were not significantly different from rural or urban fringe schools in this regard.City schools reported 95 incidents of serious violence per 100,000 students, compared with 28 serious violent incidents per 100,000 students in towns.majority of public school principals (78 percent) reported having some type of formal school violence prevention or reduction programsThese behaviors may appear as a child struggles to focus, exhibits negative attitudes, begins touching or hitting others inappropriately, and disrespects adults.Many issues must be considered when disciplining or suspending students with disabilities so that the student 's right to a free and appropriate education is not violated.two-thirds of parents whose children had been suspended said they were not officially notified of the action.parents felt their children 's suspensions were inappropriate,African American students, particularly males, were far more likely to be expelled or suspended from school than their peers.Smoking, vandalism, obscene language and leaving without permission got the white kids in trouble, while black students got disciplined for making noise, being disrespectful, loitering and making threats,Because denial of an education is such a serious deprivation, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education encourages school officials to consider each expulsion decision carefully, and to reconsider those decisions after a reasonable period of time, particularly for young students.expulsions have soared from 95 in 1995 to an estimated 3,000 in 2003-2004,Elementary schools had not made much use of disciplinary expulsion, but where they had this was eliminated or significantly reduced, and there was clear evidence of reduction in referrals to managers for discipline and in some cases a reduction of the need for external behavior support.Long-term suspension or expulsion of a student with special needs requires careful adherence to the procedures mandated by federal law.It 's not acceptable that these kids are being pushed out of school.Any student who is to be expelled must first be tested to make sure that a disability is not causing the misbehavior.If a student with a disability is suspended for more than ten days within a school year, the IEP team must meet and determine the appropriate next steps.Basically, a student ca n't be expelled if the misbehavior is related to a disability.Student suspensions and expulsions have risen sharply in Chicago 's public schools in the past 10 years,Policies stipulating automatic suspensions for serious offenses in school need to placed and understood within the context of other potential sanctions, sound school discipline policies/codes of conduct, positive school climates and comprehensive approaches to safe schools as well as safe communities.Some reports indicate that some principals may chose to err on the cautious side under pressure of liability claims and suspend students for inappropriate reasons.where a principal uses reasonable care and makes a professional judgment, based on all the circumstances, that a student should be suspended rather than expelled, courts are very likely to defer to that judgment rather than second-guess it.Suspensions in CPS have tripled in the last ten years,Boy suspended from school for carrying nail clipper.correcting the behaviours of offending studentsreliance on enforcement rather than prevention will be more stressful and costly in the long run-aIt is easier to prevent misbehavior than to deal with it afterwards.Preventing misbehavior enables children to succeed in the program.schools that used preventive policies such as hall passes were associated with lower levels of non-serious offenses.The paper encourages a focus on prevention and early intervention through use of discipline codes, improved classroom management, low-level classroom interventions, and behavior specialists.A positive school environment can prevent many discipline problems through the use of early intervention, improved classroom management, low-level classroom interventions, and the use of behavior specialists.Curriculum focus on relationship development/conflict preventionConservatives and liberals (and all those in between) may argue about policies and methods, but everyone seems to agree that better discipline is needed in our schools.A school can impose a variety of sanctions to correct behaviours of offending students, act as a deterrent to others, improve the safety and discipline of all students and help to maintain an ordered learning environment.Peer group counseling may end up being counterproductive.new approaches to discipline are changing the way students and administrators deal with problematic school issues.However, alternatives such as in-school suspensions, diversion programs, student courts, community service, etc. all require resources and staffing.Craft school rules that children take seriously-even cherishCheating infractions can prevent you from receiving honorsA student who does not report for an assigned Time Out will serve Teacher Lunch Detention for the entire lunch period the following school day.When a student receives their 5 th Time Out, they will be counseled by their team of teachers about their behavior and will become a Detention Level student.Such misbehavior as rudeness, pushing, fighting, throwing objects, obscenity, and other offenses may result in the suspension of transportation services.Conduct reports submitted by the bus driver may result in disciplinary actions and possible suspension form the bus.A hearing will be scheduled at the end of the extended suspension with the School Bus Disciplinary Committee.In cases of suspension or termination of bus service, the parents must provide the student with transportation to and from school.Should the committee receive adequate assurances from the student, bus privileges will be immediately reinstated.In the event the committee decides that adequate assurances are not in place, school bus privileges will be terminated for the remainder of the school year.The Principal will then communicate the disciplinary action to parents/guardians and a meeting shall be held at the school if necessary.Students must be in their assigned area, or have a pass from the teacher.Currently, there is little tolerance for any misbehaviour in schools."no research exists showing that  zero-tolerance '' policies improve school order and safety."""Virtually no data suggests that zero tolerance policies reduce school violenceZero-tolerance is good for some students and not for others, depending upon family factors and individual circumstances.school officials will be allowed to exempt kindergarteners and first graders from some of the district 's zero-tolerance rules,There is as yet little evidence that the strategies typically associated with zero tolerance contribute to improved student behavior or overall school safety.Zero-tolerance policies ... can undermine good students ' educational opportunities and put them at a greater risk for involvement with the juvenile or criminal justice systems.Zero-tolerance policies are resulting in inappropriate sanctions for some students.Zero tolerance policies are ineffective and can become divisive among school staff.Administrators were concerned about the possibility of unintended consequences of zero-tolerance policies (i.e. inappropriate suspension for a minor or single infraction) but were not aware of widespread misuse of such policies.Is there evidence suggesting that some unacceptable behaviours are better suited to a zero-tolerance (non-discretionary) approach?Participants struggled to develop a consistent definition of zero-tolerance policies.many schools across the country in recent decades have taken more of a zero-tolerance approach to discipline.Current zero-tolerance policies, which are instituted by individual school districts based on established district-wide policy, do not require school administrators to ratchet up punishment based on the severity of an offense.ISS programs can modify student behaviour, protect the learning environment and protect the community.individualized reintegration programs that taught and counseled youth in anger management were effective in facilitating re-entry into school.Thirty-nine percent of public schools had a policy to report serious crimes to the publicSchool psychologists conduct evaluations that will aid in future educational program planning for children.public school programs focus on rewards and punishments for altering behavior patterns.Longitudinal results, from elementary to high school, show reduced problem behavior in teens.Schools say more resources and parental support are needed to handle unruly students.Standards for dealing with ... disruptive student behavior, must be as variable as the personalities of the students and the settings in which disruption occurs.If someone is out of line, the teacher sends a message down the row and deals with the behavior afterwards.Teachers who have not been trained in the skills of limit-setting will tend to be confrontational when dealing with outrageous behavior.The prevention and treatment of juvenile delinquency.It is the responsibility of your teachers to provide consistent modeling of appropriate community behavior and consistent supervision and correction of student behavior.Responsibility and accountability for one 's own actions and their impact on othersStudents who make good choices about their behavior and accept the responsibilities that ensure success in school will be rewarded weekly.Teachers are also responsible for making sure the troublemakers are not Sitting next to each other.Responsibility for each pupil 's conduct should be assumed by all teachers of the school.teachers have a responsibility to maintain order and discipline.If children receive one message in school, but parents do not follow through at home, we are not benefiting the child at all, rather, we are destroying any hope of helping the child become a responsible adult.You choose your behavior, and you are responsible for the effect of your chosen behavior upon the community.Discipline at home and school.Good child discipline changes as the child grows.Some misbehavior is an expression of transitions in the school-age child 's rapid development.Ultimately, there 's only one kind of discipline that really works, and that 's self-discipline.Effective discipline helps our child develop self-control, respect for authority, and empathy.Good child discipline requires good family communication.When school leaders, teachers, and other school staff respect parents * and share information with them openly and frequently, parents are more likely to trust and work with the school to support their child 's learning.Examine your school 's beliefs about parentsHaving good lines of communication with parents already in place can make a huge difference when a school is working on discipline issues.Communication with parents will help ensure effective discipline in your school.Frequently, behavioral problems witnessed at home will manifest at school, and therefore, only a joint collaboration between the parents and the teachers can help the student.Traditional approaches to discipline create school contexts that may increase problem behavior.The need to restructure discipline in our schools is necessary.Traditional discipline does not allow for troubled students to improve themselves and their character.But for students who commit infractions, there is a graduated system of discipline.ADEQUATE STRUCTURE PREVENTS EXPENSIVE REMEDIATIONDiscipline can only work if all members of a child 's community are on board.attempts to discipline students of all ages usually occur in an exclusive manner.We are currently thinking of how we can use disciplines to benefit the students and the community.Schools are not the warm, caring environments they once were.I believe the approach for discipline should be handled in different manners based on the reasoning of he child 's action.COOPERATIVE DISCIPLINE is a philosophy of social learning that emphasizes the responsibility of all members of the community.Cooperative Discipline establishes an environment for social learning that emphasizes COURTESIES AND EXPECTATIONS.good school discipline begins in the classroomThe disciplining of our children is inextricably linked to the basic values we hold as human beings.Students are placed for both mandatory and discretionary reasons based on the District 's code of conduct and State law.Highlight key aspects of your school 's discipline work at PTA/PTO meetings and publish an overview of your school 's approach to discipline in the parent handbook.One new approach or discipline strategy can change the course of our child 's development.seeing discipline as an opportunity to teach social skills rather than punish wrongdoers.The principal of every school is responsible for providing a free copy of the discipline code to any person upon request.Give staff techniques for teaching and reinforcing expected behaviorIn the area of setting discipline policy, the percentage of teachers who thought that they had a lot of influence decreased notably as school level increased (from 42 percent of teachers at elementary schools to 31 percent at middle schools and 25 percent at secondary schools)In some there was still a significant challenge from a minority of resistant staff; in one school there were strong feelings by a vocal minority that this kind of approach represented an undermining of proper discipline.School order and discipline preferred over students ' rights.Whether this makes a difference in the nature of school-level decision-making and implementation of school discipline remains to be studied.Differing perceptions and multiple realities may cause conflict and confusion in schools and homes over discipline.We need studies of parent, student, teacher and administrator attitudes/beliefs and practices relating to school discipline.Slee (1997) has presented the theories underlying professional approaches to discipline and behaviour management that show punitive approaches to discipline are self-limiting in their effect on children and youth.If we were to take a poll of teachers concerning the most pressing discipline problem. at their school sites, most would top their list with discipline problems outside their classrooms.Students are placed in the G.A.P. for violating the Student Code of Conduct.For most teachers and administrators, the question of discipline really is more about learning than it is about gaining control of the classroom.There is little evidence that a non-discretionary approach to serious offences is more or less effective than a discretionary one.School-based administrators want discretionary authority to respond to the needs of their students.Management of student imbroglios, student discipline, and school decorum fall readily within the discretionary function exception to the Tort Claims Act.They also suggest that school districts develop specific policies for students who consistently violate behavioural expectations.Some schools and school districts, using their own resources or in partnership with other agencies, provide alternative education programs for students who have been removed from the regular school setting for disciplinary reasons.The district has implemented a Comprehensive Discipline Plan to support the needs of all students.Fifty-five percent of large schools and 57 percent of medium-sized schools controlled access to their school buildings compared with 40 percent for small schools.Controlled access to school grounds also varied by locale, region, percent minority enrollment, percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, and principals ' reported discipline problems.City and urban fringe schools were also more likely to control building accessNinety-six percent of public schools reported that visitors were required to sign in before entering the school buildings"Are  good '' school discipline/student conduct policies in place in most schools in Canada?"""There is a remarkable consensus in the materials reviewed that zero-tolerance, sanctions, a student code, school discipline or even efforts to improve the school climate are, by themselves, insufficient to ensure that a school is safe and caring.That study also found that schools with zero-tolerance policies had more incidents of a less serious nature."In 1995, Chicago Public Schools unveiled a  zero tolerance '' policy that dramatically lowered the threshold for student expulsions."""local school board policies appear to continue to be narrow in scope.In all cases when dealing with a discipline issue, we follow Board policy and regulations in conjunction with Ohio and Federal law.The need to develop specific policies and procedures for students with behaviour, emotional or other disorders has emerged as a concern in Canada and other countriesBegin regular meetings with principals and security staff regarding clear interpretation and reinforcing Student Conduct and Discipline Policy at their schoolseffective school policies cover the relevant issues as well as potential long-term solutions.Eighty percent of schools reported having a closed campus policy prohibiting most students from leaving the campus for lunch.policies addressing student evaluation for special education services should highlight the need to accurately describe students ' behavior as well as their academic achievement;Policy should direct programs to 1) formally assess the student and follow through, 2) coordinate multiple interventions, 3) address a constellation of related factors as well as the behaviours, 4) ensure the sustainability of the programs, 5) provide a coordination of proactive, corrective and instructional strategies, 6) be developmentally appropriate, 7) include parent education and family therapy, 8) intervene in early childhood whenever possible, 9) emphasize positive actions over punitive ones, 10) be fair, consistent and free of racial bias.Governments have responded to increased concern with new laws and regulations requiring schools to establish zero-tolerance policies, school codes of conduct, school-wide plans to prevent violence and special measures to ensure that students with behavioural disorders are managed properly.How can this support be encouraged?PBIS focuses on creating and sustaining primary (school-wide) , secondary (classroom) , and tertiary (individual) systems of support for positive behavior.More attention needs to be paid to ensuring an active, adult presence in the school and in encouraging students to report their concerns.Immediate research on the prevalence of inappropriate and unacceptable behaviours in schools is needed.One of the emerging research trends and questions is that no single basic choice of approach to school discipline and safety may be appropriate for all schools.The study showed small but unreliable decreases in problem behavior.A key finding from a range of research indicates a strong link and overlap in the lives of children between victimization/care issues and offending.Research is urgently needed on the roles that all partners can play in school discipline and violence prevention.School-site discipline management includes the management of noise in the halls, noise and mess in the cafeteria, cuts and tardies, yard duty, bus duty, smoking in the lavatory, and conduct in assemblies to name but a few.In order to succeed, school-site discipline management procedures and responsibilities that have been carefully organized and practiced need to be detailed and shared."School-site discipline management procedures, like classroom rules, routines, and standards, describe the  how to '' of carrying out basic jobs at the school site."""Faculty consensus and commitment are required to deal with most problems of school-site management.An interactive web site should be used to offer a schools a comparative school assessment which is able to publish a confidential report to the school on how well they are prepared and functioning in respect to school discipline and safety.Consensus and commitment are the ingredients by which school-site discipline management lives or dies.elementary schools reported proportionately fewer incidents of serious violent crime.Four percent of elementary schools reported one or more serious violent crimes compared with 19 percent of middle and 21 percent of high schools.Principals in public high schools and middle schools were more likely than public elementary school principals to rate at least one discipline issue as a serious problem in their schools.Middle schools and high schools were more likely to report that they had experienced one or more incidents of any crime and one or more incidents of serious violent crime than elementary schoolsAbout half of all elementary schools (45 percent) reported at least one crime.Elementary schools, which reported proportionately fewer incidents of serious violent crime in general, reported lower rates of both physical attacks or fights in which weapons were used and rape or other type of sexual battery than middle and high schools.One way to address behavioral issues in elementary students is to post classroom rules and expectations that students are required to follow.Students, parents and school employees must understand that rules are to be consistently and fairly enforced and obeyed.taking corrective action when children have disobeyed the rules,Unified Discipline sets school rules and correction procedures, but at least in this article it places too little emphasis on teaching and encouraging expected behaviors and monitoring program implementation.For students at Conway Middle School who do n't follow the rules, the school also has a step-by-step discipline plan that includes warnings, contacting parents, discipline referrals, detention, and parent conferences.good school rules are not enough.It does n't take long for your child to learn whether you really intend to enforce rules.Do n't set rules unless you will consistently enforce them.Teachers are expected not only to punish those who break the rules but also to congratulate those who do n't.Whereas classroom rules, routines, and standards focus on the responsibilities of students within the classroom, school-site discipline management procedures focus on the responsibilities of the faculty.A number of behavioural and security precautions can be taken to support a positive school climate and an ordered, school discipline.School-wide positive behavior support: Addressing behavior problems that impede student learning.Good instruction is one of the best behavior management tools,"Inadequate training in classroom management in teacher education and certification programs and in the School District 's own teacher induction program limits these teachers ' ability to implement fairly the School District 's new  zero tolerance '' discipline policy."""The next highest priority is behavior management.Glasser 's choice theory, also known as control theory, posits that humans have five basic needs and that all behavior is undertaken to meet or satisfy these needs.some children in the school setting may need to move around and burn off extra energy.behaviors are a child 's way of communicating.Perhaps a specific negative behavior is the child 's attempt to explain a hidden complaint or fear.once you understand what her behavior communicates about her needs, you can help her learn more appropriate behaviors.Parents and teachers can strive to understand a child 's behavior by opening up the child to a discussion about how they 're feeling in school, or by meeting for a parent-teacher conference to address specific concerns and issues in order to brainstorm a plan of action.As young children are introduced to new academic environments, they often exhibit problematic behaviors.truancy prevention should be part of a comprehensive approach to school violence.Student absenteeism/class cutting was also more of an issue in large schools, with 53 percent of these schools compared with 24 percent of medium schools and 19 percent of small schools considering it a serious or moderate problem.Failure to give a proper excuse note (within three days of return to the school) will result in an absence being considered as an unexcused absence.Legitimate notes from parent/guardian must be turned in to roll call teacher within three (3) school days.Students will be expected to bring an absence note to school from parent/guardian within three (3) days from the first date of return back to school from the absence.Three or more consecutive absences will result in an attendance referral.Excessive absences will result in loss of credit for coursework.Absence dates for which absence notes are not returned will be declared illegal/unexcused.All schools have an overt culture and a hidden one,Bullying appears to be the most prevalent in middle schools,bullies and their victims were more likely to skip school, less likely to have As or Bs, and more than twice as likely to be obese as students not involved in bullying.more than half of Minnesota students reported they had been bullied or had bullied someone else at least once in the past year,If not addressed, bullying among adults will spread to students.If adults are permitted to bully and mistreat each other, or their students, no program, assembly, or curriculum will have much impact.To improve classroom climate, you have to have good classroom management,Success with classroom management reduces teacher stress more than does success with management outside the classroom.POWER-PAC is also seeking a statement from CPS encouraging elementary schools to reestablish recess and noting the benefits for education and classroom discipline.A functional behavioral analysis must be completed and an individual behavior management plan developed, or modified if one is already in place.Instituting school-site discipline management procedures puts into bold relief a dimension of the principal 's role as instructional leader that is rarely appreciated.if the student can behave appropriately for 90 days, then he or she can return back to the standard classrooms.learning how to behave in an assembly is as much a part of the students ' socialization as is learning how to behave in a classroom.Teachers are responsible for their students ' behavior in an assembly just as they are in the classroom.A common assumption among faculties who have severe management problems with all-school assemblies is the notion that managing large-group settings is not part of their job.In schools where all-school assemblies have degenerated into blatant rowdiness, typically few teachers and administrators are on the scene managing the situation.One of the keys to a school-wide behavior management plan is for everyone to agree to a common approach,Successful management of behavior outside the classroom does not increase time-on-task and learning within the classroom nearly as dramatically as does classroom management.The efforts of the faculty in behavior management in the cafeteria must be matched by the administration, particularly at the elementary level."A conflict resolution approach called  peace circles '' was used to handle classroom infractions, bringing together everyone involved in a supportive conversation which holds offenders accountable."""Students will assess their philosophies in regard to classroom management practices and discipline models.Teachers may have to deal with behavioral problems in the classroom, problems may include immaturity or a student 's inability to focus and pay attention to class material.more aggressive first grade boys who were in higher aggressive first grade classrooms were at markedly increased risk,As with classroom management, the ownership of the values, rules, and procedures of school-site discipline management will be much greater if the people responsible for implementing them are enfranchised in the process of development.Educators need to emphasize prevention and positive modeling.Adults have to be more positive, rather than being reactive to behavior,Respect for parents and other authorities is crucial to self-discipline and healthy development.Students will show respect for others, for school property, and for the property of others.Usually physical proximity, relaxation, a respectful prompt, eye contact, and closed mouth will produce the desired result.Show respect for your child 's feelings and thoughts, while standing firm on your expectations for good behavior.Preserving the child 's dignity is always a top priority.Research in the following areas indicate that schools can support a peaceful school climate strategy through the use of several behavioural/discipline/security activities.Responsive School Discipline is an approach to creating a school climate that enables optimal academic and social growth in students.Schools in which principals perceived that general discipline issues were not a serious problem were more likely to report that they had no crime incidents.Sixty percent of public schools in which principals reported no discipline problems or only minor discipline problems reported no crime for the 1996-97 school year.Only crimes occurring at the school, including those that took place in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at school-sponsored events or activities, but not officially on school grounds, were to be reported.Increases in crime and discipline incidents occurred in a number of school systems across the state during the 2006-07 school year.Long-term suspensions fell sharply, from 85 in 2007-08 to 69 in 2008-09, an 18.8 percent decrease, according to a report released by the state Department of Public Instruction.Differences between elementary schools and high schools were also found in the rate at which robbery was reported, although no difference was found between elementary and middle schools for this crime.Solutions are most readily found closest to the point of the problem.Much time is devoted to attitudinal change, communication skills, group processes, and problem solving.Students carrying a weapon to school or possessing or using an illegal substance, may be placed in an appropriate interim alternative educational setting (IAES) for up to 45 days.A FAB is also an integral part of a manifestation determination for severe problems related to weapons and drugs in the school setting.The detection of illegal substances and firearms on our campuses is crucial to our safety and security efforts.when a student has been expelled for possession of a dangerous weapon or a controlled substance or assault on school staff, and the student applies for admission to another school, the superintendent of the sending school shall notify the superintendent of the receiving school of the reasons for the pupil 's expulsion.Frustrated or bored children are likely to act out, so it 's important that children be engaged in their work.Administrators will be working with security officials to bolster the use of metal detectors and to more closely monitor activities in the hallways and restrooms while class is in session.Students may choose from a variety of activities that are offered as a celebration of their good behavior.The district has continued to implement the Positive Behavior Support (PBS) program.PBS helps individuals change their lifestyles toward positive behaviors and make problem behaviors irrelevant, inefficient, and ineffective."PBS helps teachers develop  self-managing '' classrooms and decrease discipline issues through such techniques as a "" social contract."""In addition, DPS has expanded the Positive Behavior Support (PBS) program.Low-level disruption continued to be the most wearing for teachers;For elementary and high schools, student tardiness and student absenteeism or class cutting were among the three most often cited serious or moderate discipline problemsDisruptive students appear to be a heterogeneous group not easily identified, the best predictor being poverty.Students late to class will be marked Tardy in e-School.Restorative approaches were seen to involve a set of principles, strategies and skills.Restorative approaches can be seen to work at all levels of the school, with all students, including those in trouble or conflict.Both campaigns promote the restorative justice approach - emphasizing accountability as an alternative to zero tolerance and punitive discipline - as a more effective approach to reducing violence,Students were enthusiastic about the use of circles and restorative meetings in helping to resolve conflict."The terms  restorative practices '' and "" restorative approaches '' are used in education to mean restoring good relationships when there has been conflict or harm and developing school ethos, policies and procedures that reduce the possibilities of such conflict and harm."""restorative approaches recognize the human wish to feel safe, to belong, to be respected and to understand and have positive relationships with others.there is very considerable variation in the degree and character of student support between schools and between local councils.Research has continuously shown that schools where students are safe, academically engaged, and supported by the adults in the building are more likely to have fewer dropouts and higher student performance.The authors delineate the features of a team-based approach to providing positive behavior supports for individual students with chronic problem behaviors within a school-wide PBS system.The better parents understand your school 's discipline approach, the more fully they can help support positive school behavior in their children.Authors show that improving behavior support is possible but takes time and how the school-wide effort lays the foundation for all other behavior supports and discipline practices.Many of our buildings are incorporating a classroom model that provides an evidence-based framework for implementing positive behavioral support procedures in the classroom.Problem behavior of students in elementary and middle schools requires a preventive, whole-school approach [and] the foundation for such an approach lies in the emerging technology of positive behavior supportA striking premise throughout the book is that the work that supports children 's positive behavior and productive learning is not only the leader 's work, it is everyone 's work.The Scottish approach acknowledges the theoretical framework underpinning other approaches to supporting children in schools.Students are extremely motivated by the reward system,we do n't reward average behavior.studies show that kids generally behave better when they know exactly what 's expected of them.the expectations for every occasion and every location are very specific and on display in hallways and classrooms.It is expected that the teacher will contact the parent by phone or e-mail when behavior has become an issue and documentation of the communication will be recorded in a communication log.Students receive the tickets from their teachers and other staff members for obeying school rules and meeting and exceeding expectations.Parental expectations may be beyond what the child is able to achieve on a consistent basis.Discipline referral will be sent to the assistant principalOffice Referrals may also be written for persistent misbehavior or severe misbehavior.Children who misbehave at Dewey Elementary School can receive an office discipline referral (ODR) form.Office Referrals will result in one or more of the following consequences: Principal 's Lunch Detention After School Detention School Detention (Removal from a class) Thursday School SaturdayFindings support use of office referrals as a readily available index by which to identify school discipline problems, design interventions, and evaluate outcome.Parents are notified immediately if there is a major offense.form indicates whether a student has committed a major or minor infraction.Discipline techniques that belittle or shame a child are truly harmful.Harsh measures were proposed which were always strangely separated from any meaningful system of supervision and accountability.Giving in to an urge to scream teaches your child that it 's okay to lose control when she 's upset.Often a heavy-handed teacher turns a relatively innocuous situation into a painful if not dangerous one.Should the situation become dangerous, the adult simply excuses him - or herself respectfully and leaves peaceably.Both spoiled and harshly-disciplined children are at risk for emotional and behavioral problems.Establish signals that get children 's quick, quiet attention anytime and anywhere in schoolchildren are watching your actions more than paying attention to your words.Should the child revert to previous behavior patterns, or is still disruptive in the classroom, then the student will be asked to return to the behavior modification program.If behavioral problems continue after intervention, disciplinary actions may be needed.American students were far less tolerant of serious misbehaviour in school;A Written Warning serves to inform both the student and parent that misbehavior is occurring and consequences will follow if the student continues to misbehave.Gender is a constant dimension, with teachers finding boys consistently more challengingIf a student 's behavior is consistently disrupting the class, contacting the student 's parents or seeking help from an administrator may be a good solution.Supervision of the cafeteria at the elementary level follows the same principles as at the secondary level with the exception that it has a larger element of instruction concerning appropriate cafeteria behavior-especially in the primary grades.An active administrator role during the lunch period pays dividends not only with the student body but with the faculty as well.They will go to the end of the lunch line.A principal must have knowledge of educational administration based on academic disciplines as well as applied professional practice.The student should be sent to the principles office and it should be handled within the school system not through the police.Visiting the office becomes a learning experience rather than a punitive one.In the last ten years, nearly 100,000 students from every corner of the state - in rural, suburban and metro areas alike - have been handed over to the police for issues that mostly used to be resolved in the principal 's office.Treatment schools showed improvements in student office referrals and social skills, but not for perceptions of safety.These students are placed at the Dillard Center for reasons such as pregnancy, having emotional/mental health problems, returning from a rehabilitation program, or other issues.A student who presents a problem is placed in an alternative program within the school, or at a partnering private alternative school.POWER-PAC has called for education-oriented discipline programs as an alternative to excessive use of suspensions, which they say do n't improve behavior or address underlying issues.children who have behavior conduct disorder or emotional disabilities are enrolled into a program that focuses on behavior modification.In these programs, the student is pulled out of their regular course and is provided with a new set of classes specifically designed to focus on structure and discipline.Once a child is taught the rules and guidelines for positive behavior, the child may return to his or her regular classroom once per month, while gradually earning the privilege to attend his or her regular classroom full time.To encourage positive behavior after a child leaves the behavioral program, both teachers and education specialists can monitor their progress in the classroom and in periodic student-teacher conferences.The intervention achieved a reduction in problem behaviors.Parental involvement is important in encouraging a child to act appropriately.A visual analysis, supported by a correlational analysis, demonstrates a functional relationship between the intervention and student problem behavior.The focus of decision making is clearly on the welfare of the child.G.A.P. seeks to provide these students with an environment that promotes positive decision-making, self-discipline, positive social skills, and improved academic performance.Effects of Team-Initiated Problem Solving on Decision Making by Schoolwide Behavior Support Teams.Gabor (1995) reported from his surveys and focus groups that police officers, educators and students were increasingly concerned with school discipline problems.Physical conflicts among students were more frequently reported to be serious or moderate discipline problems in city schools than in rural schoolsSo they do n't want to draw attention to their discipline problems.Litter and cigarette butts on the lavatory floor mean a long, difficult afternoon in front on an unappreciative audience.Tobacco use was also more frequently regarded as a serious or moderate problem in large schoolsLatinos who remain in bilingual programs long term risk falling behind in the middle grades and failing once they reach high school."NSBA and the other groups argued that the expanding use of social networking and other forms of online communication have led to  a stunning increase in harmful student expression that school administrators are forced to address with no clear guiding jurisprudence."""Third Circuit ruled unanimously for the student.The mission of the Department of School Safety and Student Discipline is to create and maintain a safe and healthy environment at school, on school-owned vehicles and at all school sponsored activities and events for the benefit of our students, staff and visitors.Students are placed in the program for code of conduct violations for a minimum of six (6) weeks.A teacher may, however, contact a parent before two weeks pass to discuss the issue.There will be a Time Out form sent home for parent signature after the Time Out is served by the student.How will students be able to provide feedback?Positive Guidance and Discipline for Afterschool Programs will look at behaviors and feeling, developmental domains, reasons for misbehaving, setting up a constructive environment, and using positive guidance and discipline techniques.This matter-of-fact demand for mindless obedience follows quite naturally from the premise that all problems are the students ' fault.Schools with serious crime also had more programs per school.

Night terrors are similar to nightmares, but differ in that night terrors usually occur during deep sleep, in the first half of the night rather than during REM.They also may sweat a lot during sleep and may have headaches in the morning.Nightmares are relatively common.The best way of dealing with sleep terrors is different to nightmares because the child is in a different stage of sleep.There 's a lot going on while we sleep, and this is intensified for our children.A child with sleep terrors will scream uncontrollably and appear to be awake, but is confused and ca n't communicate.Bedwetting or sleep terrors also may occur.Night terrors run in families.Sleep terrors usually begin between 4 and 12 years of age.Night terrors usually occur shortly after the child falls asleep, within the first three hours.Most night terrors last between thirty seconds and five minutes.A night terror (sleep terror) is most likely to occur in children aged 3-11 years and occurs in approximately 5 % of children.Waking a child from a sleep terror is not a good idea as this could be very distressing and confusing for the child.Night Terror The child, again a preschooler, suddenly sits up in bed crying.For persistent night terrors, a physician may prescribe an anti-anxiety medication for a short period.Other than nightmares, night waking is usually prolonged or restarted after a period of your child being able to sleep through the night, by some kind of change in your child 's regular routine.This sleep disorder, which may run in families, also can occur in adults.Psychiatric issues frequently associated with ASD such as anxiety and/or depression can interfere with sleep.It is important to address medical or psychiatric issues that potentially interfere with sleep.Stress can also trigger night terrors in children, as can illness, but one of the most common causes is inadequate sleep.Sleep problems have been related to psychopathology among children and adolescents.The causes of sleep terrors vary and until the age of six most of these episodes are simply a part of growing up and are not generally related to emotional or physical problems.Resistance to going to sleep may be used as an attention-getting mechanism from a child who may not receive enough emotional support during the day.Most sleep problems in children are not a result of bad parenting.Excessive activity during the day may also delay the onset of sleep.Recent thinking suggests that sleep and mood disturbance may have a common etiology based in the development of the brain structure.medical issues more common in children with ASD such as epilepsy or gastroesophageal reflux can disrupt sleep.Certain stimulating drugs and caffeine can be responsible for difficulty in sleeping.Sometimes medications your child might be taking can be alerting and contribute to difficulty falling asleep.Children can get very creative when they want to stay up later.When children have recurrent sleep problems, they and their families must deal with negative effects on behavior, mood, social interactions, physical stamina, and performance at school or work.A tired child may have development or behavior problems.Children usually have bedtime problems because they are trying to test your limits or because of poor sleep habits.Children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) appear likely to experience sleep problems,their ability to get out of bed, separation anxiety, the need for autonomy and the development of the child 's imagination can lead to sleep problems.duration of sleep differs at different ages and from child to child.The duration of sleep varies from child to child.Behavioral management techniques can be helpful in eliminating unwanted behaviors.Children with behaviorally-based sleep disorders also often have significant sleep disturbance, with irregular sleep-wake schedules, and/or fragmented or insufficient sleep.behavioral manifestations of daytime sleepiness in young children, such as hyperactivity, clearly overlap with problematic behaviors that do not result from sleep deprivation/disruption.Behavioral sleep disorders Behavioral sleep disorders are most commonly observed in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers.Because of the high prevalence of sleep disorders in children, taking a sleep history is the first and most important step in assessing pediatric patients.Nonpharmacologic interventions are the first line of therapy for children with sleep disorders.Hyperactivity, increased motor activity, exhaustion, and general irritability may be manifestations of fatigue caused by sleep disturbance for children with and without diabetes.Dietary intervention studies have shown convincing evidence of efficacy in reducing ADHD symptoms in children.An ADD ADHD child often lacks the social skills that are essential to success in life.Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterized by leg paresthesias and/or dysesthesias with an irresistible urge to move the legs.Preschoolers who do n't get enough sleep are more likely than other children to be hyperactive and inattentive by the time they reach kindergarten,a study by academics in Finland suggested a good night 's sleep could reduce bad behaviour and hyperactivity in children.Children who were reported to sleep less in preschool were rated by their parents as more hyperactive and less attentive compared to their peers at kindergarten,Children learn to fall asleep in the conditions their parents set up for them."The child learns to connect or  associate '' going to sleep with a person or activity."""Parents need to assert that they are the ones who decide when it is time for bed.Remember that the approach to each is different so it is important to know which it is your child is experiencing.Before you can know if your child is getting enough sleep, it can help to know how much sleep you should expect your child to get.The best way to do this is through consistency.To ease the transition to bedtime, keep things quiet during the last hour before bedtime.try anticipating his or her needs by offering all the usual services before you turn out the light.But children who haven t learned to fall asleep on their own call on their parents.When your child wakes up during the night they can look around and be assured all is well before falling back to sleep.check that they are not worried about any events during their day.Establish a schedule of the day 's main events, such as the same waking time, nap time, and meal times.Vary your child 's daytime activities, making sure they are interesting and varied.Create a consistent and enjoyable bedtime routine.Maintain a daily sleep schedule and consistent bedtime routine.Set nighttime expectations with limitations that are consistent, communicated and enforced.Try to structure the evening so that your children can wind-down, relax, and get ready for a full night 's sleep.If you make the whole going-to-bed routine friendly, relaxed, and just the same from night to night, you stand a better chance of things going smoothly.Do not let your child fall asleep while being held, rocked, fed a bottle, or while nursing.Put the child to bed while sleepy but not yet asleep.Determine a simple bedtime routine that is well suited to your child, such as reading a book or talking for a few minutes about the day 's events.Bedtime should be age appropriate with an established routine that provides behavioral cues for transition to sleep.This routine involves quiet activities that please and soothe the child.A predictable, calming bedtime routine is often the key to a good night 's sleep.Try to encourage your child to settle to sleep alone and institute a consistent bedtime routine.Encourage a regular sleep routineRegular routines offer babies and young children comfort and security.Follow a consistent bedtime routine.Positive bedtime routines The parent develops a regular routine to get the child ready for bed each night.Have a relaxing bedtime routine that ends in the room where the child sleeps.Other studies have emphasized routine and an organized environment: children put to sleep at the same time and place every night fell asleep more easily and had more regular sleep.Maintain a regular and consistent sleep schedule.Firstly, both parents should adopt similar routines so that the child receives consistent messages.Make sure your child is settling to sleep in a situation that is comfortable and free of too many distractions.Chat through the events of the day and ensure the child is cosy and relaxed in bed.All computer games, playstation or other electronic games should be turned off well before bedtime.Eliminating Distractions from the Bedroom Perhaps the most important consideration for children is to address elements in the sleep environment that may be disruptive to sleep.Make the bedroom environment the same every night and throughout the night.Infants should be placed for sleep in a nonprone position."Establish a regular  sleep friendly '' environment.""""Offer the same set of comforters in the same order as the last part of the bedtime routine, a drink of water, a kiss, a teddy bear, a  night-night."""Which means keeping the bedtimes the same, but also not letting them sleep in much past their usual/appropriate wakeup timeAnd remember to praise your child when she does sleep through the night, stays in her own room or goes to bed without protesting.Each night, you might praise your child for a specific accomplishment or describe something that makes you proud of your child.If you want the child to go to sleep early, see that he does not sleep during the day.Make sure that the room temperature is just right to promote sleepThe times between visits to the bedroom lengthen gradually and you should n't go in if it sounds like your child is settling and becoming quieter.Ignore any further requests or questions.The preschooler will probably need bedtime rituals as a way of winding down.As much as possible, the bedroom should be reserved for sleeping.Use your sleep logs to keep track of when your child shows signs of sleepyness, and when he actually falls asleep.Set aside 10 to 30 minutes to get your child ready to go to sleep each night.Gradually put your child to bed later in the evening until you have reached the bedtime you want.Giving a ten-minute warning time helps ease the transition to bedtime for some children.The key problem is that they can not settle themselves to sleep when alone.Since going to sleep represents a time of separation from the family, even older children may feel lonely at night.Parents who do sleep with their children have been criticized as it is not a widely adopted approach.Cosleeping is also a popular option at first.Do not bring the child into the parent s bed.children who do sleep with their parents usually start asking for their own bed or begin sleeping in their own bed when they are about four.Studies of other cultures reveal no psychological or physical harm apparent where children sleep with their parents.I believe that a baby who sleeps in his mother s bed soon after birth has less sleep problems and behavioural problems later in life.Lying down with the child may be helpful initially, but does n't help the child develop her own strategies for falling asleep.The aim is to give your child the experience of falling asleep in their own cot/bed independently without any help from you.Childhood sleep disorders are one of the most common complaints brought to family doctors, with nearly half of new mothers complaining of infant sleep problems.Night terrors are fairly common in children and occur in approximately 5 % of them, mostly between the ages of three to five.The number of physical and sleep complaints was significantly decreased in the diet group compared to the control groupSleep problems are very common, reportedly as high as 80 % in children with ASD.About 25 % of children experience some type of sleep-related problem during their development.Research has shown that up to 25 % of pre-school children have a persistent sleep problem.Up to 1 in 4 pre-schoolers have sleep problemsTwenty-five percent to 50 percent of children over six months of age continue to awaken during the night.Encourage your child to exercise regularly and spend time outdoorsVigorous physical activity during the afternoon can make a big difference at night as well."According to the National Sleep Foundation,  a child will spend 40 % of his or her childhood asleep '' and '' by the age of two, most children have spent more time asleep than awake."""Following birth, sleeping patterns evolve rapidly and become consolidated in early childhood.Many parents are unsure of how much their child should sleep.Every child 's sleep needs are slightly different, and this may be largely determined by genetics and other factors.All children and adults wake briefly during the night but quickly put themselves back to sleep by reestablishing associations used at bedtime.During this REM phrase, which accounts for half of their sleep time, babies wake easily and tend to twitch, jerk, suck, make noises and flutter their eyes.Sleep habits-both positive and negative-are established early in a child 's life, often in infancy.This hot topic has been prepared to help parents and carers understand the issues associated with sleep as well as providing some useful tips on assisting children and young people to improve their sleeping habits.Since every child is different, sleep charts are not exact; however, there are some agreed-upon ranges for children of different agesThe parent learns how to help his or her child develop positive sleep habits.For children, sleep plays a critical role in their healthy growth and development.At this age, most children will sleep for about 10 to 12 hours at night.Most parents are unaware of just how much sleep their children require in a 24-hour period.Some two year olds can survive on 10 hours of sleep in a 24 hour period whereas others need much more than that.Parental behaviours at bedtime -- especially their response to their child s nighttime awakenings -- play a big part in consolidating their child s sleep patterns.How parents behave at bedtime and during nighttime awakenings can determine how their child s sleep pattern evolves and how fast it consolidates.Some parental behaviors in turn predicted future bad dreams, total sleep time of less than 10 hours per night and sleep-onset latency [delays in falling asleep] of 15 minutes or more.Sleep behaviour evolves rapidly and consolidates by 17 months of age.Other factors, such as an overall negative parental perception of both their child 's bedtime and daytime behavior, may be operative.NREM deep sleep Toddlers are far more physically active than infants, and their sleeping behavior and the timing of sleep cycles reflects their maturing brains.Most babies are capable of sustained sleep (6-8 hours in a row) at night by age six months.Daytime sleepiness resulting from fragmented or disturbed sleep is often manifested in young children by behaviors such as increased activity, aggression, impulsivity, acting out behavior, poor concentration, and inattention.Our conceptualization of an elevated problem and intensity score on the ECBI as potentially indicative of daytime sleepiness is similar to that of other studies that have examined the complex association among daytime externalizing behavior problems, daytime sleepiness, and sleep deprivation or fragmentation in school-aged children.Children affected generally complain of an inability to fall asleep at night yet feel sleepy throughout the dayFor some children, a brief late afternoon nap and reducing stress is helpful.Stress and excessive fatigue are also thought to be factors.Poor sleep in the later childhood years is usually not an isolated problem and is likely to be a manifestation of other stresses,Identifying and reducing the stress the child is experiencing is also helpful.Avoid allowing your child to exercise too close to bedtimeAvoid caffeine particularly close to bedtime,Avoid violent movies, television programs and books.Avoid the use of electronics close to bedtime such as TV, computer, video games etc. that can be stimulating making it difficult for your child to fall asleep.Try not to give him or her any medicine that has a stimulant at bedtime.Nocturnal PSG is the objective gold-standard procedure to study sleep.BEARS (bedtime, excessive daytime sleepiness, awakenings, regularity, and snoring) is an easy-to-remember mnemonic that can be used to help gather the history of symptoms.Actigraphy is an activity-based sleep-wakefulness monitoring method that provides continuous objective data of patients ' sleep with night-to-night variability.Sleep diaries can provide information on the child 's bedtime, sleep onset time, rise time, and number of nocturnal awakenings and are typically kept for a period of 2 weeks.Although they commonly occur together, night waking and settling problems have typically been studied separately.Each additional hour of TV watching in the evening was associated with a noticeable jump in sleep problems,Everyday fears and experiences such as watching a scary movie, often cause children to have nightmares.To preschoolers, animated violence is just as scary as real violence.Television is part of the daily lives of many young families and a new study shows that watching TV in the evening and violent shows in the daytime can disrupt sleep of preschoolers.Don t allow children to watch violent and scary movies on television.Watching violent shows during the day also was associated with increases in sleep problems.Child should sleep in the same sleeping environment every night, in a room that is cool, quiet and dark - and without a TV.Kids with a bedroom TV -- who logged an additional 40 minutes of screen time each day -- were eight times more likely to have parent-reported daytime tiredness.parents whose children have a TV in their room were more likely to report their child was tired during the day.Dysomnias are a broad classification of sleeping disorders that make it difficult to get to sleep or stay asleep.Narcolepsy is a rare chronic neurologic disorder that presents with daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotional arousal such as laughter) , hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.Specifically, children with narcolepsy should obtain adequate nocturnal sleep and maintain a consistent sleep-wake schedule, since alterations to sleep patterns can exacerbate daytime sleepiness.Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) , as part of the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing, has been relatively recently recognized as an important clinical phenomenon in children and adolescents.Sleep apnea occurs when your child regularly stops breathing for 2 breath cycles or longer during sleep.Sleep will tend to be unsettled, there is frequent awakening and short periods of apnoea in association with loud snoring.The diagnosis of sleep apnea in children is best made with an overnight polysomnogram (sleep study) performed in a sleep laboratory.Children with asthma or allergies are also more at risk of developing sleep apnea.Obesity, nasal allergies, neuromuscular diseases, the use of medications with sedative effects, sickle cell anemia, and a family history of OSA are all risk factors for the development of sleep apnea in children.Affected children are quite often obese.Children with cerebral palsy or sickle cell disease may be more likely to develop OSA.Allergic rhinitis and non-allergic rhinitis, resulting in nasal congestion, is another important risk factor for sleep apnea in children.Sleep apnea can have serious, long-lasting consequences in the growth of a child both mentally and physically.Children with OSA may sleep in unusual positions.Cognitive and behavioral problems are common in children with OSA.Medical complications of untreated sleep apnea may include poor growth, high blood pressure, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.OSA occurs in about two percent of young children.Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been estimated to affect about 2 % of children in the general populationOSAS is estimated to affect 1 % to 3 % of children, and has a peak prevalence in the preschool and early elementary school-aged years.OSA often occurs between the ages of 3 and 6 years when the tonsils and adenoids are large compared to the throat.Approximately 1 % to 3 % of preschool-aged children have sleep apnea, which peaks between the ages of 2 and 6 because of enlargement of the tonsils and adenoids and a proportionately small airway.Sleep apnea is more common in boys, overweight children and African American children.OSA also is common in children who are obese.Even brief apneas can cause a child to have low levels of oxygen in the blood.Because children have smaller lungs, they have less oxygen in reserve.Children who have sleep apnea almost always snore or have heavy, labored breathing.Bedtime battles are very common with this group and when they stay awake for hours after being put to bed everyone can become disheartened.When surgical treatment is ineffective, treatment with a continuous positive-airway pressure (CPAP) device can be useful for treatment of children with OSA.If children have sleep apnea, they often have difficulty concentrating, paying attention and remembering what has been learned.Children may attempt to overcome the airway obstruction by sleeping with their necks hyper-extended, sleep sitting upright or using multiple pillows.Breathing-related sleep disorder in children has been associated with daytime somnolence and symptoms of inattentiveness and hyperactivity.If you plan to take a gradual approach to the problem have all the steps written out before you start.Treatment consists of brief self-help booklets and support from a telephone coach.There is little research that compares behavioral methods with drug therapy in treating bedtime problems and night wakings in children.Use sleep medication only when prescribed by a doctor If you suspect that your child 's sleep problem is serious, take them to a doctor or a specialist for proper diagnosis and treatmentMedical treatments using trimeprazine were found to be effective in reducing both the frequency and duration of night waking.Most problems associated with sleep can be prevented by caring parents who promptly attend to the needs of the child during the early months of his life and keep a watch on the factors that may contribute to sleep disturbances.Ninety-four percent of the studies (49 of 52) support the use of behavioral treatments for bedtime problems and night wakings.Sleep is especially important for children as it directly impacts mental and physical development.A child who gets enough sleep and sleeps well is more likely to be cheerful during the day.Sleep training techniques are not going to help a child who has a sleeping disorder or medical condition because they have no control over their snoring or other symptoms.Sleep training is not a one-size-fits-all solution;sleep training techniques such as controlled crying and gradual withdrawal methods, are usually the most effective way to stamp out sleep problems caused by separation anxiety.Sleep is an emotional issue, with wild claims made on all sides of the attachment parenting to sleep training continuum.Sleep disturbance in infants and young children has also been found to be associated with lower cognitive performance.Sleep problems in these children may be associated with poorer child psychosocial quality of life, child daily functioning, caregiver mental health and family functioning.sleep-disordered breathing in children is associated with growth deficiency.Fragmented sleep in older children has been correlated with problems in learning, emotional development, and growth.This issue is often linked to other mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorderone study found that a greater amount of nighttime sleep was associated with less aggression in preschoolersNight-waking is one of the most prevalent behaviourally-based sleep problems in 2-5-year old children.Night wakings are one of the most common sleep problems in infants and toddlers.Night waking is a result of a complex interplay of factors intrinsic to the child (eg leg cramps, cough) and the unintentional perpetuation of the problem by parental reaction.Sleepwalking is not a sign of an emotional illness; of more concern is the risk of injury.Many sleepwalking children will wake up promptly once a light is turned on but generally it is wiser not to attempt to waken the child.Sleepwalking, like night terrors, typically occurs in the first third of the night when the child goes from non-REM to REM sleep.For young children, the most common sleep problems are night waking and difficulties settling to sleep.But night waking still occurs in 36-45 % of infants aged six months to one year to a degree that is considered problematic by parents.Sleepwalking is often familial and it is most prevalent between the ages of 10 and 12.Quiet sleepwalking can be observed in over 15 % of children aged 5-12 years.Naps should not occur too close to bedtime as they may delay sleep at night.All too commonly we believe that a skipped nap, for example, can be made up later.They may then have a nap only in the afternoon until the age of 3, when they may stop having a nap during the day.My baby naps at about the same time every day so his body is ready for a sleep when I put him down, and this means he goes to sleep without any fuss.Many in this group will stop napping as they enter kindergarten.Long and frequent daytime naps result in a shorter nocturnal sleep period, delayed sleep onset, and nocturnal awakenings.They may resist this because of separation anxiety, if they are not tired enough to sleep due to a late nap or simply if they want to play with their parents.Preschoolers - 11 hours (including up to 2 hours of daytime sleep in 1 nap)Good naps lead to good night-time sleep, and vice-versa.Naps are helpful for preschool children, but should not be taken late in the afternoon as they can interfere with bedtime.Most 3-year-olds have given up naps but may still need a quiet time after a busy or an overstimulating day.Don ' t start on a program if you know that there is some major change about to happen in your child 's routineWhen starting on a program you will need a few weeks of stability so that your child will have the chance to adjust to any changes you are planning to make.Children who snore do poorer on standardized tests of mental development.Mood is associated with snoring in preschool-aged children.Finnish researchers evaluated preschoolers who were three to six years old, 43 of whom snored and 46 of whom did not.Snoring in children may be a sign of a serious medical condition that deserves further evaluation and treatment, as the consequences can be significant.Your child snores very loudly or struggles to breathe during sleep.Brain function tests showed significant differences between the two groups, including decreased attention and language skills among the children who snored.children who snore at least once or twice per week are more likely to have symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as attention and language problems.Most children with OSA have a history of snoring.Bedtime problems and night wakings are common in young children.Many children grow out of sleep problems.Sleep problems are some of the most common issues faced by parents with growing children.Most sleep problems are temporary.A settling problem is defined as taking more than 20 minutes to settle on five or more nights a week over at least two months.Children who have sleep terrors usually do n't remember the events the next morning.Children can have just one type of problem or can have a mixture of problems.If your child is getting several hours of either more or less sleep than is the average for her age, she may have a sleep problem.Children are especially susceptible to consequences of sleep disruption.When parents or teachers have concerns about a child 's school performance and/or behaviours, sleep problems may be an issue.Sleep problems in childhood: a longitudinal study of developmental change and association with behavioural problems.Child Sleep Problems May be Linked to Depression or Anxiety.The Impact of Children 's Sleep Problems on the Family and Behavioural Processes Related to their Development and Maintenance.As with toddlers, difficulty falling asleep and waking up during the night are common.Some sleep problems may be normal at certain age levels and should not be a cause for alarm.More frequent sleep problems were seen in children with chronic medical, neurodevelopmental, or psychiatric disorders.Sleep associations are everything your child associates with falling to sleep and are often the key to understanding your child 's sleep problem."Our goal, thus, is not to  sleep through the night '', but to promote healthy sleep associations and self-soothing skills so that your kids will fall back asleep when they wake 5 times every night."""Nocturnal wakings are typically related to inappropriate sleep-onset associations such as rocking, feeding, and parental presence.Once children wake up at night they are unable to go back to sleep without recreating the same sleep association.If your child is having problems settling to sleep or is a frequent waker during the night you may find it helpful to consider their sleep associations.This parent 's child appears to be connecting the action of falling asleep with being rocked.It is normal for a child to wake during the night, but they will find it difficult to get back to sleep if their sleep association is gone.However, some sleep problems may become chronic, and have a serious impact on the young person.Daytime sleepiness and behavior problems may signal poor sleep or a sleep problem.Children with sleep terrors will often also talk in their sleep or sleepwalk.Compared with children without sleep problems, those with sleep problems were more likely to miss or be late for school, and their caregivers were more likely to be late for work,Some sleep problems, though, are resistant to behavioural modification and can indicate a health problem that requires further investigation.It may be that the present is not the time to try to change your child 's sleep problem for a number of reasons.Star charts can be very helpful with the older child - 3.5 years + - who is having problems with sleeping.Children who do not sleep well may have a sleep problem.Sleep problems common to the toddler set are made worse both by violent media content and greater evening use of televisions, computers or video games, a new study suggests.Sleep problems that first appear in infancy may persist as the child grows older.a high PLMS index can be found in children without other symptoms of RLS or with another sleep disturbance,sleep problems that start in babyhood can continue for life.If a child is experiencing daytime behavior problems or mood disturbances, it 's important to assess if it is stemming from an underlying sleep disorder and to seek treatment.Preschool age children may have sleep problems, including trouble getting to sleep, frequent night waking in the middle of the night and having irregular sleep patterns.Chronic sleep problems may take some time to change.Food routines can help maintain circadian rhythms,Complex carbohydrates, as well as turkey, peanut butter, bananas, soy and dairy products (which all contain tryptophan) can help you get your sleep on.Parental strategies that were effective for early sleep difficulties (e.g. giving food or drink) may later become inappropriate to the child 's age and needs.Parents must be particularly sensitive to the fact that they must attend to both providing nurturing and to encouraging independence.Most children show improvement in a few days, and will be sleeping through the night in a week or two.Regardless of whether your child meets a clinical definition for a sleep problem, if you 're concerned about your child 's sleep for any reason, you should discuss your concerns with a professional.You should discuss your child 's sleep problems with your child 's doctor.Talk to your pediatrician if your child is sleeping much more or less than this, although it may still be normal if your child is healthy, happy, and growing and developing normally.if you feel you do have a difficulty with your child 's sleeping pattern it may be worth having a chat with your GP or Public Health NurseIf your child has an ongoing sleep problem, then you should talk to your child 's doctor or to a sleep specialist.A sleep specialist at an accredited sleep disorders center can determine which treatment option is best for your child.Sleep experts have built a strong case for including sleep as an integral part of understanding healthy child development.Experts recommend that your child get the following amount of sleep at each stage of growth: Infants (3 to 11 months) : 14 to 15 hours Toddlers: 12 to 14 hours Preschoolers: 11 to 13 hours School-age children: 10 to 11Most sleep experts agree it is important to allow children to fall asleep on their own.If your child suffers from a sleep disorder such as sleep apnea, sleep walking, sleep terrors, restless legs syndrome, he may need a referral to a sleep specialist.Consult your doctor if you have tried everything and you still feel that your child has problems sleeping.If a parent notices the child 's behavior that 's abnormal -- whether it 's inattention or daytime fatigue or sleepiness or irritability or aggression -- and this is a persistent problem in the daytime that becomes a problem in school as well as in the home environment, then that is when the parents should seek a sleep specialist.There is no cause for alarm if a child has occasional nightmares, which are most common between the ages of three and eight.For occasional nightmares, hugs and reassurance are the best response.Times of change, such as moving, starting school, or adjusting to a family change, can trigger nightmares.A traumatic incident such as a road traffic accident may be asociated with nightmares recurring for 2-3 years.Many children will have the odd nightmare and will not be suffering from stress or worry.If a child has recurring nightmares and becomes fearful and irritable during the day, consultation with a professional can be helpful.children with full post-traumatic stress disorder and associated nightmares, one may suppress REM sleep using tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine) so as to provide settled sleep for a few weeks.Occasionally a sedative medication may be required and the preferred one is chloral hydrate 10 mg/kg given one hour before the child goes to bed.With further development of imagination, preschoolers commonly experience nighttime fears and nightmares.5 mg of melatonin administered at bedtime reduced sleep-onset latency and increased total sleep time.Melatonin along with behavior modification and good sleep hygiene can be beneficial to children and teens with this problem.By the time children reach preschool age, the sleep cycle is about every 90 minutes.sometimes your child 's current circadian rhythms has him going to bed later than you think.The main way to tell if your child is having trouble sleeping due to separation anxiety, you will be able to tell because she will be able to fall to sleep when you are present.So if your child needs a parent present to fall asleep at bedtime, he might need a parent to help him fall back asleep during the normal awakenings.Put your child to bed as usual but then leave the room after saying a short good-night.Once your child has been put to bed, you should be strict about the rule of not leaving the bedroom.For younger children transitional objects such as teddies and blankets can provide comfort as an alternative to a parent 's presence,Extinction with parental presence allows the parent to remain in the child 's room during the process.The parent then ignores the child 's protests and crying until morning.Para - somnias are strongly associated with genetics and usually present in many family members.Behavioral insomnia results in delayed sleep onset, fragmented nocturnal sleep, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness.Sleepwalking is the most common parasomnia in children.I find that all babies and children are different - they have different sleep needs which are constantly changing.Because the magic of children is that they are all very different from one another, and that they are unique in their transitions from one stage of growth to the next,Sleep-deprivation in our children is a family issue.Children should avoid sleep deprivation, stressful situations, and caffeine close to bedtime.Sleep-deprivation in children often goes unnoticed and rarely gets the attention it should.If your child acts sleepy, it is likely that the child has serious sleep deprivation.Unlike in adults who become sleepy and sedate with sleep deprivation, children have the opposite response and become more hyperactive and unruly.Children who regularly have trouble waking up in the morning and complain of being tired throughout the day are most likely sleep deprivedAvoidance of excessive fluids at bedtime and caffeinated beverages helps with sleep onset and reduces the likelihood of nocturnal awakenings.It is possible to block deep slow wave sleep by using benzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam 2-8 mg at bedtime) and this may be used in the short term (up to 4 weeks) to stop night terrors.Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is the most commonly used agent in children for sleep initiation problems.plastic mouthguard worn at night may be used for severe teeth grinding.Dopaminergic medications such as pramipexole and ropinirole are used in adults with RLS, and evidence suggests that these drugs are effective in children as well.The duration of sleep at night depends in part on the duration of daytime naps.Strategies to improve sleep duration among young children may be an important component of behavioral interventions that promote childhood overweight prevention,Children do differ in the amount of sleep that they require and probably the best guide to the adequacy of sleep is the absence of fatigue in the daytime.A newborn infant has a 4 hour sleep rhythm whereby he/she will awaken every 4 hours and slowly through childhood this rhythm is replaced by the adult pattern of 16 hours wakefulness followed by 8 hours sleep.A sense of calm serenity should descend and the lights should be lowered.Some children are happier if a dim light is kept switched on all through the night.Parents need to give their children well-defined limits.Establish a relaxing setting at bedtime.Limit-setting problems usually begin after the age of two.Limit-setting sleep disorder refers to parental difficulties in establishing behavioral limits and enforcing bedtimes, which commonly result in stalling by the child and refusal to go to bed.At bedtime, do not allow your child to have foods or drinks that contain caffeine.The parents should settle the child in his/her own bedroom, the lights in the house should be generally turned down and a nightlight should be allowed during the night.Sleep talking is a sleep-wake transition disorder.A person who talks during sleep typically has no recollection of the actions.Waking and crying at night is a common occurrence with toddlers.Toddlers ' drive for independence and an increase in their motor, cognitive and social abilities can interfere with sleep.Toddlers also react to too-exciting days, arguments between parents, new day care arrangements, and other emotional factors.Toddlers and preschoolers between 1 and 3 years of age need about 11 to 13 hours of total sleep within 24 hoursolder toddlers and preschoolers require between 11 and 13 hours every day with 2 hours as a midday nap,Even if the almost-five-year-olds are ready to drop it, they still have to be on their beds resting for at least an hour and a half.Toddlers and preschoolers usually need 10 to 12 hours of sleep each night.Many toddlers experience sleep problems including resisting going to bed and nighttime awakenings.From the age of 18 months, toddlers often associate sleep with a piece of silk, a rag or favourite teddy and simply will not go to sleep without them.This disrupted sleep has negative effects on children and parents, which includes fatigue and impairment in affective, cognitive, and behavioural functioning.Sleep disturbances have been linked to a number of negative consequences on children 's daytime functioning, including their social and emotional well-being.If not treated, it may cause a variety of concerns such as heart disease, problem behaviour, learning difficulty, and growth problemsBad sleep habits in children may lead to health problems in adulthood.A child 's sleep problems can also cause unnecessary stress for you and the other members of your family.Young children who wake up early and who do not return to sleep can be a major burden on parents, especially those parents who themselves are of an ' evening ' disposition.One study that manipulated sleep opportunity in a sample of healthy school-aged children found that sleep restriction had a direct effect on teacher-rated attention and academic performance.Sleep problems can affect a child 's learning, mood, attention, behavior and health.Poor sleep habits in babies and children have been linked to obesity, hyperactivity, poor behaviour, slow growth and learning difficulties.sleep difficulties may result in problems with growth.Losing sleep can undo the rejuvenating effects learning has on the brain.If a baby or young child does not sleep well at night it can disturb not only the child but the whole family, causing lack of sleep and stress for the parents and older siblings as well.Infants who were sleeping less than 12 hours per day were more likely to be overweight at 3 years of age.children reported to sleep for short periods may be at risk for later difficulties,Although the impacts of sleep problems on children and young people are not well documented [12] , the available evidence indicates that a chronic lack of sufficient sleep may lead to: lowered physical and mental capacity to recover from sickness or deal with stressful situations.Parasomnias are much more frequently seen in the pediatric population and usually represent the normal neurophysiology of sleep development.Parasomnias are much more prevalent in children with psychiatric or neurologic disordersInsomnia - is when a person finds it hard to fall asleep, stay asleep, or settle back to sleep.The management of insomnia in children should include education about normal sleep development, the establishment of appropriate and realistic expectations for the parents and child, and clear treatment goals.The use of melatonin in children may be effective for sleep initiation insomnia caused by circadian factors.Some children with persistent insomnia will need further behavioral or pharmacological

necessarry to monitor their behavior.Research has found that young people who are not regularly monitored by their parents are four times more likely to use alcohol or drugs.Do n't be afraid to spy if you suspect something-you may save your child.Barun also recommends gradually loosening parental controls on children as they pass through the teen years.you ca n't insulate your children from the world.However, strict authoritarian control often backfires by causing children to rebel.They WILL make the wrong choice if you restrict them from stuff.The first thing you have to realize is that you ca n't pick your child s friends.Be authoritative, not authoritarian,if you tell your child that you 'll be checking up on him and he gets angry about that, that 's too bad.The government even agreed and has said that rehabilitation programs, treatment, and second chances for non-violent offenders is more effective than using force to control people.Research also has shown that parents who are more permissive but involved in their kids lives are typically more effective in preventing drug problems than those who set strict rules but are absent.In this way, children are less likely to feel they have to declare independence on their own though self-destructive methods, such as drug use.Parents who never let their child experience things on their own or take responsibility for themselves

room and find a bottle of alcohol, marijuana or paraphernalia, you should consider them to be at the abuse level.Know who your kids are with.Encourage your child to invite friends over to the house.Know where your kids are and what your kids are doing.Providing alcohol to underage children where there is no responsible supervision is not only dangerous, it is illegal.Adults must provide responsible supervision to minors when supplying alcohol for consumption in private places such as parties or Schoolies.Parents need to help educate their kids, and make sure they are supervised and

drugs and alcohol in the company of their peers.Positive Peer Pressure In a time when peer pressure can be very destructive to our students, it is important for kids to encourage each other to make the commitment to stay away from drugs and alcohol.The entrance requirements for the drug clique are easy.Examples of these are peer pressure, false information from others and the glamorization of alcohol by the media.When kids are afraid of bullies and other kids, one of the options they have is to join the group and become a bully.Our children are confronted with negative influences on a daily basis.Do n't ever underestimate the power of peer pressure.The more your children are active, the less time they have to get caught up in the pressure from peers to drink alcohol and use drugs.peer pressure is the most commonly cited reason why kids start doing drugs.When teens are under the impression that everyone else does drugs and everyone experiments with alcohol, the peer pressure just closes in on them, and it will seem like such a big task to them to stay away from it.there is no other reason for your child to pal around with kids who do drugs.Even in elementary or intermediate school, kids want to be cool.Teens especially are known for casting all common sense aside to follow the mind-numbing crowd.Some kids become druggies because they ca n't figure out

no prepares them to know how to respond before they are even in that situation.You need to role play with them and help them find the words to say no.It has become an epidemic that is destroying the

believe these drugs are very available to students anymore.You know they have a drug problem and it 's destroying their lives and you know if they have money, they might buy drugs.Know that the enemy

high, and they 'll lie to you about it.If these are your child s friends, realize that he is almost certainly engaging in the same type of risky behavior even if he says he s not.While your own teen may not be in turmoil, friends they associate with can be.Discuss what makes a good friend, and the difference between being a friend and peer pressure.If you have a kid with behavior problems, you will often find that they are attracted to friends who also have behavior problems.There are many kids in school that provide each other with information about drugs, or encourage their friends to use drugs or alcohol.When kids enter adolescence, they employ a way of looking at the world in which their friends are more important than anybody else.Because she was in a new environment and she knew now which friends NOT to hang around with she got a new fresh start."He was pressured into doing it by his  friends"""In this generation teenagers are NOT popular if they do n't drink.I even know of kids who were told that the group would hurt their family if they did n't steal, deal, and use."there 's a lot of pressure to use the drugs that kids see as  soft ': pot, ecstasy, and pharmaceuticals."""They have the idea that they ca n't be a star in any area that counts to their peers.Good kids do stupid things and can associate with others that do dumb things.Sometimes the message sounds different when it comes from a peer, rather than an adult who is constantly telling kids what not to do.Keep Track of Your Child 's Activities:monitor their child s activities.Know what your kids are doing."It is also recommended that parents keep track of what their child is doing at all times, by asking the  w ' questions: who they are with, what they are doing, when they are doing it, and where.""""Also, the  fire and brimstone ' preaching approach is bound to fail."""Teenagers are not always rational and rational explanations do not always work.Do n't ridicule or lecture, as

with their child;Understanding that communication is a key factor in substance abuse prevention,One of the most important things a parent can do regarding risk taking behaviors including substance abuse or experimentation is to have a relationship with their child that leaves the communication lines open,Parents should make themselves aware of these dangerous activities so they can talk to

down drugs if they are offered.Work on creating an environment in which you can discuss difficult subjects with your kids.Communication of feelings is particularly important.Establishing a dialogue now helps keep the door open as kids get older and are less inclined to share their thoughts and feelings.Allow your children to express painful emotions so they wo n't need to numb themselves with drugs.Children who can not express feelings are not as likely to receive support from others, and are more likely to turn to drugs or alcohol to try to change their feelings.Parents of 6th -8 th

knew, and also to give my own opinions about using alcohol, marijuana, and harder drugs.If a parent chooses to lie about their own past drug use, they run the risk of losing credibility with their child in the future.I spoke to him at length about drugs and the fact that it is a family disease.I felt it was time we could have a conversation about it and she should hear real stories.The challenge of talking to your teen about drug and alcohol abuse should begin right away.Be prepared to return to the discussion over several days and weeks.I believe that age appropriate open

experiment with drugs or alcohol while at home so they can be supervised are setting a poor example for their kids.Some dangerous assumptions about drug addiction parents can make is thinking the drug use is a passing phase.Blame does n't fix anything, confrontation of a problem and identifying solutions does.These family members soon learn how to enable the drug addict or alcoholic, by providing money, excuses, and even a place to live.I find the worst thing a parent can do is to blame all the problems in a childs life on drugs.How can you blame a parent when you never say what the problem was to begin with?much of behavioural psychology thrives on giving people excuses for negative habits, instead of demanding responsible behaviour."Making excuses for their alcohol and drug use including when they miss class or a family function or covering up for them actually  enables ' your child to continue to drink and use drugs."""Parents who say things like its his choice or blame there child dont realise that as a parent it is there job to teach there child he isnt born with a moral compass and a head full of wisdom, he needs guidance, love, support and to be taught.if a parent, even unintentionally, is sending the message to their kids that recreational drug use or drinking and driving is ok, their children will get that message loud and clear.It is better to admit a problem and get help than cause long-term adverse effects on your kids.They know adults who rationalize their own illegal drug use by stating that it is no worse than alcohol and should be legalized anyway.Some of these parents do n't want to grow up themselves, so they let their kids join in on their drinking parties or drug abuse.As a parent, I think you want to be a little smooth about that.Just 3 % of parents with 13 - and 14-year-olds believed their child might be using the substances.Know your child Know your kid.Be realistic about the potential for your child to be exposed to alcohol and tobacco, maybe even drugs.Some parents tell themselves they 'd rather have their kids doing these kinds of things at home with parents watching instead of on the streets or at friends ' houses.If the older one never uses drugs, do n't assume the younger one will not use drugs either.many parents think drugs education is nothing to do with them, and it should come from teachers.Do not assume Sally or Johnny 's drug use is just a passing phase or something every kid must go through.You know there will be some use, but you need to always be pushing back in the opposite direction.They may feel like they are bonding with their kids, or getting them to be more open about teenage drug use.I was blinded like most, my child never would be an addict.some kids start to violate family norms, and parents tend to deny that this is separate from the phase.Be careful not to be more permissive with a son than a daughter - the risks are great for both.Research studies show that parents who drink alcohol or use drugs are more likely to have kids who drink or use."Due to their drinking and drug use, and their out of control behavior they become the focus of attention and labeled as the  problem ' or "" troublemaker."""Parents are afraid to discuss their own past,Kids also have the option of just ignoring their parents ' drug or alcohol abuse and going on with their own lives.Parental actions like their own drinking, smoking and drug-using habits are the main lessons parents deliver,some kids who get clean end up relapsing because their substance-dependant parents send the child addict-designed messages that are incongruent with what the child just learned in treatment.Mixed messages about drug legalization, particularly marijuana, may be to blame,Marijuana is easily available, relatively cheap, and kids say that it relaxes them, it 's effective for stress, and gets rid of their anxiety.Marijuana potency has grown steeply over the past decade, with serious implications in particular for young people, who may not only be at increased risk for various psychological conditions, cognitive deficits and respiratory problems, but are at significantly higher risk for developing dependency on other drugs, such as cocaine and heroin, than are nonsmokers.Among kids who use drugs, 60 percent use only marijuana.Depression and suicidal thoughts can also be a by-product of smoking marijuana.If you 're a parent and you smoked marijuana as a young person, do you have a leg to stand on when you talk to your kids about it?Marijuana destroys motivation, it screws up memory, and it gradually destroys self-esteem.I wanted to clarify my ideas about sharing your own experiences with marijuana, alcohol, and/or other drugs with your child.Marijuana is one of those substances that many people do n't see the harm in.Regardless of whether or not people are hoping to make marijuana legal someday, for now the substance is illegal, and it should not be presented in a way that is appealing to kids.Parents of older teens were far more likely to report that their child might be using alcohol or marijuana.If I knew what I know now I would never have smoked marijuana even once!Young people are especially vulnerable to marijuana s addictive effects,People fear what damage more potent marijuana will do to those who are expecting pot to be a harmless recreational drug.about half believed that marijuana use among the nation 's 10th-graders was 40 % or higher.Marijuana is the most widely used illegal drug among youth today and is more potent than ever.It 's simply not true that kids do n't develop a dependence on marijuana.Not only do teens think using marijuana and driving under its influence is harmless, but this study suggests that some teens think they are even better drivers while high.Kids use marijuana far more than any other illegal drug.Age 12, like with sex education, is a pretty solid age to introduce your children to the general aspects of marijuana use.Those who are in favor of legalizing marijuana, especially for medical purposes, do n't see the potency as necessarily a negative thing.those who want to see marijuana used nationwide for medical patients believe that more potent strains will be good for patients.Residents in some parts of the country have been surprised to see marijuana-shaped candy showing up in some convenience stores.They see the candy as an invitation to use marijuana, and argue that kids will be influenced by it.Marijuana has also been found to impact the user 's cognition and emotion.Each year, more kids enter treatment with a primary diagnosis of marijuana dependence than for all other illegal drugs combined.Marijuana is stronger than it used to be and we now have research that tells us about the frightening things it does to your personality and your performance in school, sports, and every area of your life.by 12th grade, marijuana use increases to more than two in five teens.The research is clear and unequivocal marijuana is a physiologically addictive drug causing both tolerance and withdrawal symptomsMarijuana use can lead to a host of significant health, social, learning, and behavioral problems at a crucial time in a young person 's development.My younger brother died from smoking marijuana.Studies this year show that young people 's use of marijuana is on the rise."There 's  a dangerous trend toward the acceptance of marijuana and other substances compared to our study of teens conducted just two years ago,"""I recently found a glass pipe on his dresser that had marijuana resin on it.One of the dangers of marijuana is that it 's much stronger than it was twenty years ago.Even though, statistically, teens are at greater risk for abusing marijuana, parents should n't feel helpless.Kids need to hear how risky marijuana use can be.One of the heartbreaking things for parents is they often do n't know where to go when their child is using drugs.She was looking for an answer, the solution to fix her son and stop his behavior.if I can slow him down, even a little, I am helping.These vulnerable years are when teens and tweens are exposed to drugs and alcohol, and parents ca n't let the normal turbulence and frustrations of raising teens interfere with their determination to keep their kids from risking their health.Parents are often very distressed about their son/daughter 's drug use.How do we help our children see the complete foolishness of their peers ' actions, so they do not continue this childish behavior?Your kids are watching you, and are modeling themselves after you.Parents are role models for their children so your views on alcohol, tobacco, and drugs can strongly influence the views of your child.Kids imitate their parents.Put the alcohol away for a while, or quit the occasional drug use so that you can set a good example.Lil Wayne himself admitted that he used to drink Sizzurp because he grew up idolizing other rappers who were using it.Be a role model When it comes to drugs there 's no such thing as ' do as I say, not as I do '.Kids really need role models as they grow up, and knowing that others have made it through the teenage years without trying drugs will help them a great deal.It is important for the MLB and other sports organizations to work to provide good role models in a time when so many public figures are falling to drug and alcohol abuse.research actually shows that teens look up to their parents for guidance much more often than we might think.Be a Role Model and Set a Positive Example:the best way to influence your child 's attitude is by role modeling your actions and statements that drug use is dangerous and not tolerated in your home.parents need to lead by example,Recent research has found that 2 out of 3 kids ages 13-17 say that losing their parents ' respect is one of the main reasons they do n't drink alcohol, smoke marijuana or use other drugs.Recent scientific research has found that the longer an individual postpones the onset (first use) of alcohol, tobacco or other drug use, the less likely the individual is to develop an addiction or other lifelong problems, including depression.The first step to recovery is to take an action."We can not simply sit back and hope that our kids will  get through it."""Actions are more persuasive than words.Parents have no choice but to take matters into their own hands now, before it is too late.Be an active part of their livesLike most parents, you 've probably been dealing with the symptoms (hair, dress, curfews, and contraband) , not the deeper problems (feelings, peer pressures, family dynamics, addiction)if a child is taking drugs something is wrong.Drug use is a symptom of other problems,when we drug drugs, it enables society to deny the real problems in the world.Using pot is dangerous and illegal.Chances are, if you think that your child has been smoking pot, he or she probably has.First off, 3rd grade (8-9 yrs old) is too young to talk about pot.Pot is harmful to a teen in and of itself and is usually a gateway drug, leading to other drug use.Teens need to know that when they use pot, they can actually cause permanent damage to their brain.Tell the other parent, I have learned from my daughter that your daughter may be using pot.Back then, pot, as we used to call it, contained four percent THC, now it 's about eight and a half percent-which is still a significant increase.My son smokes pot, and I hate that - but I do n't hate him.there are a lot of drugs and chemicals out therePrescription drug abuse has been steadily increasing, as well as inhalant abuse.Inhalants like aerosol spray cans, markers, shoe polish, glue, cooking spray, and air conditioning refrigerant can be used to produce a drug-like high.Inhalants are readily available to kids, and often young people do n't see inhaling these household substances as being harmful because these things are legal and found everywhere.These inhalants can be very addictive also, leading the individual down a long road of destructive behavior.Teens use these inhalants by sniffing, snorting, or inhaling from a bag.The high will usually be short-lived, which leads a teen to inhale again and again to keep up the good feeling.Most inhalants result in a tired feeling, dizziness, hallucinations, or trouble with motor skills - all things that teens might find entertaining to observe.Over time, however, inhalants can lead to brain damage, muscle weakness, and depression.Very young kids are inhaling or huffing those substances and risking permanent brain damage.some kids die suddenly from inhaling these substances.Sudden death can occur through heart attack, suffocating, or choking, and injuries may occur from careless acts while under the influence.There is no warning before death occurs, and it does n't matter if a person has huffed many times before, or if it is their first time.if we focus too much on an increase in numbers of kids getting high with inhalants or prescription painkillers, we can trick ourselves into generalizing that all teens are doing these things,These items can give your teen a real high, just like street drugs, yet they are found in most homes so teens do n't always see the danger in them.The substances are legal and usually inexpensive, which makes them readily available.The thing that makes this type of substance abuse so dangerous is that many people ca n't see the harm in it."Once a teen is used to the thrill of doing  harmless ' inhalant drugs, they might look for more of a challenge with street drugs."""While not every teen that smokes candy or inhales household substances will grow up to be a drug addict, it does open the door for the possibility.These potent drugs are causing growing concern for parents and law enforcement.What can you say to kids before they ever start smoking?Always throw in that his parents did n't want him to do it, or that his parents told him not to smoke.Part of the problem is in the emulating of bad behaviors like smoking or drug use.If you see a character on a billboard or on TV with a cigarette, talk about smoking, nicotine addiction, and what smoking does to a person 's body.Do n't get into fights about it with your child-just keep your values clear.Provide facts as well as your family values on their use.How do our kids learn how to work hard, save their money, and stay away from drugs when so many child stars get swept away by a life of partying and drugs?focus on how drugs affect kids ' values: their love of family, self-respect and the respect they get from othersParents can show drug-free habits, and help their kids learn the importance of hard work, kindness, and a healthy lifestyle.talking about values with your child is paramount.We need to teach our kids about the satisfaction and excitement that comes from stretching ourselves and succeeding."if you put in the hard work as a parent,  you 'll give your kids a gift for the rest of their lives."""Your kid is not equipped to make decisions about drugs.If there is even the slightest chance your child might make a bad decision in a moment of weakness, you need to know what to do.All the treatment centers in the world will not help unless the user has decided they are ready to quit.We as parents need to stand up for those who ca n't make a decision on their own because of lack of maturity and basic facts.Kids who are substance-free make that decision over and over again, every weekend,Paraphrase what your child says to you, ask questions often and ask for your child 's input on family decisions.Encourage choice, allowing kids many opportunities to become confident decision makers.The only way someone will quit using drugs is if they decide to do it.People today are beginning to see that while substance use might start as a decision to try something new, it quickly becomes an addiction that ca n't be controlled.when teens are under the influence of drugs and alcohol, their impaired judgment makes them particularly vulnerable to risky situations and poor decision-makingin cocaine addicts, the dopamine is kept from being recycled and large amounts of it build up in the brain, causing the high.Cocaine addicts are more likely to be irritable without their high, and suffer from anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations.Cocaine has many detrimental effects on the body, including headache, nausea, increased heart rate and blood pressure, decreased appetite, and problems with nosebleeds or with swallowing.He lives with his mother (my ex-wife) , and she is a cocaine user who will not take him to treatment.half of young people who are addicted to chemicals-alcohol, marijuana or other drugs-also have a co-occurring mental health disorder.Medical research has shown clearly that this kind of drug use only exacerbates underlying psychological problems.There has long been a view in the world that substance abuse is a choice, or a character flaw, not a mental illness.Kids today experience enormous stress, and they crave, as we all do, peace and serenity.Model for and talk with your kids about more healthy ways to deal with stress.Studies show that adolescents who have n't tried drugs or alcohol are more likely to start during times of transition in order to cope with stress.Your first role is to support and protect your child.Take advantage of what help is offered.When it comes to keeping our children safe, always do whatever it takes to help each other out as parents.Give your kids the tools to be safe and get out of dangerous situations.Are you protecting your child from the natural consequences of their actions?You are right to fight for his life.There 's got to be a good balance between giving teens the space they need to explore their evolving independent identities AND giving them the parenting and protection they continue to need as kids.the most important thing you can do to help your son or daughter is to commit to getting help and support for yourself!Just because they know about sex/drugs when they 're 11 + does NOT mean they 're going to go out and do it.Just because somebody uses drugs once does n't mean they 're lost forever.Always give your child a choice-never put a kid in a corner without a way out.Support groups are a great way for family members to meet and gain strength from other families who understand the struggles, fears, pains and yes, even the embarrassment of living with an addict.When all support is cut off, a person has few choices.As part of the Safer Schoolies Initiative, a range of safety and support services will be provided at the key Schoolies destinations in Queensland.You are there to show him the way out.A facility should provide follow-up services to give the recovering patient a support base when they move back into their lives.Saving a child is a family project.Parenting is hard, and there are no shortcuts when trying to keep your kids safe from alcohol, tobacco and other drugs.There are many organizations and churches that offer drug treatment and support groups for addicts.Help kids make an ongoing commitment to staying drug free.Trust, but verify!I wish that I had not been such a trusting parent and that I had really educated myself about the drug scene.I can keep my kids off drugs and I can teach my kids to be honest.If you 're honest and clear about where you stand, your kids will find it easier to be honest with you.By asking the questions in a nonjudgmental, open-ended way, you 're more likely to get an honest response.Be prepared to tell him honestly what you think his strengths really are.Kids lie - either directly or by omission.Kids can be so good at lying and covering things up.When they are using alcohol or other drugs on a regular basis, kids can be incredibly manipulative and they will lie to your face.The problem was we trusted her.Lying, deceit, cheating and dishonesty are part and parcel of this disease-not because the addicted person is a liar or a cheat by nature, but because the addicted brain needs drugs in order to functionShe has to consent, and she lies about her usage.The fact of the matter is, they have to lie if they are going to protect their ability to continue to use.Do n't assume that your child is telling you the truth when they say they are n't doing it.Be prepared for your teen to deny using drugs.trust is important with kids and answering questions honestly but at a level that is appropriate for them.Answering deceptively can cause you to lose credibility with your kids if they ever find out that you 've lied to them.Family members should n't give in and enable their loved ones to continue in their addiction; rather, they must break the cycle, come together and get help - for themselves, and their family.Remember this to give yourself hope and encouragement.As a mother i will never give up on my son.Researchers have identified over 50 factors that might put someone at risk for drug use.These risk factors can be found at the individual, the family, peer groups, and broader community levels.One of the most dangerous risks with homemade drugs is that each batch can be made differently, with changes in ingredients and measurements.Keep your focus on the use of drugs.Still other teens take antidepressants, sleep aids, or anti-anxiety medication without a prescription to help with these kinds of mental health issues.Kids that have sort of gone through the motions of doing drugs are more likely to try it with real drugs someday.teens are using household chemicals and products that do actually harm them or help them to get high.Often the ingredients are over-the-counter medicines or household chemicals.Teens and pre-teens have begun sniffing or huffing certain chemicals or household items in order to get high.We waited too long to seek professional counseling.Let the substance abuse counselor deal with your son s readiness to make changes.What you can do as a parent is try to force him to attend substance abuse counseling by using consequences.Check with local schools, agencies, and information services for resources.The counselor will also encourage your son to imagine what a future life would be like without drugs.One way for churches to engage with the surrounding community is through local schools.We 've found it helps to work with the police too.By working with counselors and staff to learn about oneself and taking accountability for the addiction, an individual can actually aid in the recovery process.For Western Australians, the Parent Drug Information Service (PDIS) (08)&nbsp;94425050 or 1800&nbsp;198&nbsp;024 (toll free for WA country callers only) provides professional telephone counsellors 24 hours a day.During the addict 's recovery from drugs or alcohol, counselors should meet with the entire family to help them all through this challenge.Substance abuse counselors use a technique called motivational interviewing.Teens have a history of trying risky behavior,Teens today are faced with more temptations for things like drugs and alcohol, and other risky behavior like huffing.Some of the latest risky teen behaviors take place with substances found in their own homes.Pair that with lack of supervision because parents are working more, and you have teens trying all sorts of risky behavior to keep themselves busy.Parents who are described by their adolescents as supportive, involved and understanding are much less likely to pursue risky behavior.That might be any number of things, including shoplifting, defacing property, using drugs or drinking.Immediate effects include euphoria, loss of coordination, hallucinations, and possibly seizure and brain damage.Immediate effects of this kind of substance abuse include slurred speech, nausea, lack of coordination, and irritability.Overdose is a very possible effect.The first group is just looking for fun and excitement.There are a couple of reasons why children will take drugs.Some kids are just plain bored."Alcohol and drug  experimentation ' by teens is risky and can lead to serious trouble, including alcoholism and drug dependence."""Some parents do n't become aware that their child has been experimenting with drugs until it 's too late.they will still be tempted to experience things for themselves that seem to fill their desire for youthful lusts, energies, and connectedness.If he can not give it up, perhaps he would consider telling your son that he wishes he had never tried drugs.Realize that your child will probably be asked if they want a cigarette or to try drugs.Let your message be clear; teens and adolescents should not experiment with drugs or alcohol at any time.Pouring vodka into the eye or soaking feminine products in alcohol may seem unfathomable to adults, but kids who see other kids experiment with it may try it themselves."Teens who start out with trying something fun and new with their friends because they are bored and unsupervised at home can quickly become addicted to the  high ' they get."""I plan to say that I experimented a bit but quickly learned how dangerous and what a waste of time it was.Overall, more than one-third (35 percent) of teens say they use drugs.About half of 10th-graders said they had used alcohol over the previous 12 months; about one in 4 (28 %) reported marijuana useFifty percent of young people have used an illegal drug by the time they leave high school.It is also important for teachers, law enforcement, government, and parents to follow and be aware of what teens are up to, and how their drug and alcohol use is increasing or decreasing."careful cross-fertilization has progressively increased the content of THC to  more than ' 20 % in some varieties found today!"""A more accurate way to look at adolescent drug abuse would be to study 5 or 10 year trends, which will tell if the increase or decrease is likely to have significant meaning in the long run.According to the research, there were drops in tobacco, methamphetamine (from 2.3 % to 1.6 %) , cocaine (from 4.4 % to 3.4 %) , alcohol, and hallucinogen (from 5.9 % to 4.7 %) use among 8-12 th graders.Parents will argue and fight with their drug-abusing child behind closed doors, but put on a good front when others are around.Conflict can become worse than when the kid was using because a kid with a clear head and armed with the knowledge that he is right and his parents are wrong is a powerful adversary.The parents are not comfortable with their child becoming more independent and the adolescent is not comfortable dealing with his parent 's disapproval, so they fight.Calling names does n't help-it just creates more bad feelings.Avoid conflict It 's difficult to solve a problem when there 's a conflict.Family members also need help and counseling, to work through the problems that the addiction has caused in the family.Rather look for opportunities to congratulate on their management of distress.Hearing the views of the young person with the drug problem as well as the views of other children in the family helps to redistribute power and may mobilise positive energy from the children.The ups and downs of recovery and relapse make family members unable to believe their loved one when they make promises because they do n't want to get hurt again.Family members find themselves getting hopeful that each time in treatment is going to be the time that works, only to be let down again and again.withdrawing all support and even contact with a person who just wo n't turn around can produce some results.loved ones have to come to a point where they need to withdraw their support.Some people credit their family members who let them hit rock bottom for their eventual recovery.A featured speaker at the event was Brigitte Nielsen, who has struggled with alcoholism and the recovery from it.Alcoholics Anonymous and the 12 Steps were founded on the principle that we need to focus on and gain strength from a higher power to help us recover from our addiction.Kids new in recovery can feel very bold and begin confronting their parents relentlessly, much to their parents ' chagrin.Parents can become defensive and belligerent towards the newly-recovering child and everyone can end up feeling pretty lousy.it is important to understand that change can take a long time and involves hard work on the part of everyone in the family.With more treatment programs and better treatment options, more people are able to recover from alcoholism.He spends hours in his room, uncommunicative.Those feeling socially isolated for whatever reason may turn to drugs.When censored in their own homes, kids go elsewhere to find support and answers to their most important questions.Someone with an addiction will often become more reserved and avoid family and close friends.Some kids who use drugs are self-medicating.Those young people who are trying to self-medicate must have help with their underlying problems.People self-medicate with emotional eating, they suffer alone with depression, and they abuse drugs and alcohol.if you suspect your child is really trying to self-medicate, or if you suspect your child is using regularly or even is addicted, you need to get help right away from the professionals.The drug dealers are getting kids addicted earlier and earlier.Many illegal drugs that end up being sold to kids and addicts on the street come from these homemade labs throughout the world.Drugs are everywhere and predatory dealers are looking for younger and younger customers, drug addiction parents need to be always on the look out for it.It is estimated that more than 50 % of the time, the drug buyer is not getting the substance that they were told they were getting from a home-based lab.The drama and risk of getting drugs, hiding them, using them, and maybe even selling them is its own kind of high.Take time to explain everything to your kids before they are misinformed by a kid who is already using or trying to sell it to them.The bottom line is that there are many people out there that prey on young people, and are willing to illegally sell them drugs, or give them information that will cause them to experiment with drugs.to have a licensed store sell candy to kids that depicts an illegal substance is just ignorant and irresponsible.Kids steal anything and trade it for the pills.It 's not the drug dealers that are killing our kids, it 's the drug-dealing doctors,I do not approve of drug use and certainly not the selling of drugs to othersparents should set realistic expectations,We ca n't ground them but we can still communicate our expectations, our philosophies, and catch them doing something right.It 's hard to expect our young people to keep on the straight path and stay away from all kinds of drugs when prescription painkiller abuse is so prevalent in all the age groups around them.they 're seeking a subculture that does n't expect anything else out of them, except that they get high.it 's important for parents to understand that if kids gravitate toward a negative subculture, there 's a problem there.The expectation is zero tolerance, but you both know it 's not going to be zero.grandparents - get involved in a positive way in your grand children 's lives and help support their parents!Grandchildren often confide in grandparents.Kids are definitely exposed to abundant information on sex and drugs, but I am also optimistic that they learn at an early age to filter and ignore a lot of the junk they are hit with.When watching TV, do some programs make drug use look acceptable, or do they show the consequences?Harness the power of media and technology to reach your kids - Take Time to Text your teens today!My sister watches over her, talks openly about alcohol, drugs, sex, and yet my niece still lies and drinks.We have talked about sex, drugs and violence but she is into none of them and I feel that this because her mother and I have raised her to be trusting of us and to be respectful of herself and her mind.Drug addiction is a disease of the body, mind and spirit, so there are many people who are trained to help.Once a child become addicted it is almost impossible to get them help.She wants to stay clean, but being an addict is difficult.The primary relationship for addicts is the relationship with alcohol or drugs.As a parent, you have the right to know what is being recorded about your child,What happens in school is not confidential, and teachers are required to record observable behaviors of their students.But each child is different, just like each adult is different, and there 's nothing you can do about that.As it relates to drug addiction parents need to recognize that each child is an individual and that life experience for one may bear no resemblance to the experience of the other.Kentucky has suffered in recent years from the trafficking of prescription medications from Florida pill mills.Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for some age groups in Kentucky.Data show that 6.5 percent of all Kentuckians have abused prescription drugs, compared to the national average of 5 percent.Some argue these sorts of drug policies help the kids too much, that there 's no accountability.there is no statewide policy directing schools on punishment for drug use.Reports released in the last year claim that all the laws, and law enforcement, and jail time for drugs have done little to stifle the growing illegal drug problem in our country.If they choose to drink alcohol, discuss being responsible.Parents need to remember that their main job is to raise healthy, productive children.If you didnt want to be there for your child and help them rather than using weed as a scapegoat when times get tough perhaps you werent responsible enough to be a parent and should have kept your legs shut.Your child should know that they have to have their plans Okayed by you first, and that they have to behave responsibly in order to earn the privilege of going out.whenever you give a fever medication or an antibiotic to your child, you have the opportunity to discuss the benefits and the appropriate and responsible use of those drugs.They have also seen lots of parents who have abdicated their responsibility for their teens.if you find out that someone drank or used drugs in your car while your son or daughter was behind the wheel, you may want to suspend driving privileges for 6 months.but data from our local surveys indicates that kids are riding with others who have been drinking and they are sometimes driving themselves after drinking, even though most kids say they do n't.Ages 13 to 17 Kids this age are likely to know other kids who use alcohol or drugs, and to have friends who drive."Plan ahead by naming a  designated driver."""You may also state that he does not have permission to use drugs in your vehicles and if they smell bad, he loses access to the cars for a period of time.driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs is very risky.Not knowing whether any kids are alcoholics or some of them slip out the back door and drive home.Some of the best kids can end up in trouble, even when they have made an effort to avoid it and even when they have been given the proper guidance from their parents.Despite efforts to educate our children about drugs the problem continues to escalate at an alarming rate,If a child reaches the age of 20 without using alcohol, tobacco or marijuana, the probability is almost zero he or she will ever develop a serious drug problem.certain groups of kids may be more likely to use drugs than others.The world is a very changed place compared to when we grew up, and if kids are not exposed to anything they may not know about the real world.younger people are so much more aware of the seriousness of alcohol and drug abuse that they are more likely to get into intensive treatment, earlier than their parents ' generation.many teens are less mature than we were,Listen carefully to what your children are telling you about their lives and how they feel.LISTEN TO YOUR CHILDREN they want to be heard.Open a dialogue, ask questions and then listen to what your child has to say.Showing that you 're prepared and willing to listen will help your kids feel more comfortable about talking with you.it is better to listen carefully to what is being said and try to understand the feelings behind it.Rather than simply teaching listening skills, rehearse parent strategies and incorporate listening skills at that time.The potent mix of fear, anger, anxiety and frustration along with feelings of loss of control is not conducive to active listening.Parents may be encouraged to use reflective listening if they understand that this will help the young person take responsibility for their actions.If you show your kids that you 're willing to discuss the topic and hear what they have to say, they might be more willing to come to you for help in the future.Be a good listener.Listen to your kidsThese goals should relate to their drug

day the child has been found unexcused from school, community service, and driver s licenses of truant students can be suspended.The student exhibits violent behavior.The student poses a threat to staff or other students.Alcoholic beverages, weapons, illegal drugs and/or controlled and hazardous substances are not permitted in vehicles parked in the school parking area.Many schools incorporate a student code of conduct in which it expects its students to follow.Writing policy and procedures for schools is a part of an administrator 's job.A school administrator 's job in the realm of student discipline is much like the combination of judge and jury.A good school administrator will weigh all evidence and make what they feel like is the best possible way to deter the student from making the same mistake twice.values will guide us in the writing of our laws and in the codes of conduct that we establish in schools.This code of behaviour shall: a) reflect the values of the local community as well as those of the wider national society; b) reinforce that all school students and staff will be safe and are valued; c) define, model and reinforce non-violent and non-discriminatory language and practices; and d) stipulate that suspension, exclusion and expulsion procedures are considered only when all other approaches have been exhausted.It should set out underlying values and principles, a code of conduct, how good behaviour is promoted, the sanctions that apply to poor behaviour, the arrangements for supporting staff and pupils, and the way in which the application of the policy is monitored and reviewed.using alternatives to corporal punishment does not mean that every teacher must approach discipline in the same way.Sanctions will vary according to the situation.Students who violate the agreements here shall forfeit their right to school Internet access and will face other sanctions deemed appropriate by the administration.Each school, organisation or children 's home must set up a control committee, led by the director or his delegate, responsible for checking any sanction that affect the well-being or physical safety of the child.If ' time out ' is used, make sure that pupils are never locked in, that there is adequate supervision and that there is no abuse of this sanction.Sanctions should be applied fairly and consistently to all pupils, taking account of all circumstances including the child 's age, and within a context of positive re-inforcement of good behaviour.Make sure that sanctions are appropriate and do not conflict with principles underlying the Children Act related to welfare, safety and the rights of children.Look for consistency in the application of rewards and sanctions; they should be fair, age appropriate and, above all, effective in reducing inappropriate or unacceptable behaviour.Teachers will use only those punishments or sanctions which are appropriate to the individual child 's needs and circumstances.Schools should replace corporal punishment with strictly enforced disciplinary codes.Discipline is often considered only in the context of punishments or sanctions.The aim of discipline should be to educate and nurture values of tolerance, respect and self-discipline in the learner rather than to victimise, seek revenge or belittle him/her.Procedural fairness includes making available to students and parents or caregivers policies and procedures under which disciplinary action is to be taken.Nevertheless, it may be preferable to have another appropriate officer, such as a deputy or assistant principal, carry out the investigation where possible.Honor codes and clearly spelled out results for infractions combined with contract law give private schools an edge in dealing with discipline.Students are afforded due process when disciplined and have every opportunity to present their side of the situation.school districts have implemented positive, effective, safe, and humane strategies to help students control and improve behavior in school.We believe that school climate must be one that never tolerates violence but instead focuses on each student 's success and how the school can foster a proactive approach to discipline.A discipline committee must be appointed to ensure the enforcement of a code of conduct that respects the child 's dignity as a human being in accordance with this law.School staff need to consistently follow-up to make it clear that the codes will be enforced.There is a consensus among those that have reviewed school discipline/codes of conductStrategies for maintaining discipline must be understood and implemented so that children learn appropriate behaviour and acquire self discipline.We had to find better, more effective ways than beating to enforce discipline."Mental Health America supports the adoption of proactive approaches like school-wide positive behavior support and  no eject, no reject '' policies."""While classroom management is important, be careful that its evaluation does not overshadow judgements about how effectively pupils learn.There are many more effective means of discipline which promote self-control and the development of appropriate socially adaptive behaviors in constructive, non-harmful ways.Since discipline is about relationships between teacher and pupil and between pupil and pupil, our discipline policy accepts every child in the school as an important human person created by God and entrusted to our care by their parents.Develop codes of conduct for members that refer to the legal prohibition of corporal punishment and promote positive, non-violent school discipline.The principal is authorized to remove students in accordance with board policies for prohibited or criminal conduct or for other behavior that interferes with a safe, orderly environment.Principals shall report on at least an annual basis to the superintendent and the board on the effectiveness of the plan in minimizing classroom disruptions, referrals to the principal 's office and the use of out-of-school suspension.Principals are encouraged to use a team approach in developing and evaluating the school 's plan to manage student behavior.Provide new teachers with adequate resources for learning to manage classrooms,Promote positive, non-violent forms of school discipline by members and their constituencies.Provide new teachers with extensive training on appropriate discipline techniques, including positive behavior models.Assess whether the teacher establishes a productive climate for learning in which pupils feel secure.Assess whether the teacher establishes a productive climate for learning in which pupils and children feel secure.Any disciplinary measure taken by an organisation, school or children 's home must be in the interest of the child in accordance with internal regulations that are visibly displayed in the establishment.Disciplinary measures concerning the child can only be taken in accordance with the child 's dignity, and under no circumstances are physical punishments allowed, or punishments which relate to the child 's physical and mental development or which may affect the child 's emotional statusMost schools have found more enlightened and effective methods for dealing with disciplinary issues.Many other methods of discipline are effective in promoting self-control, eliminating undesirable behaviors and promoting desired behaviors in children.A parent conference can be used to include the parent in the process of disciplinary action.Support measures to improve school discipline through the implementation of positive behavior and restorative justice methods,Saturday school can be used as both a disciplinary consequence and academic assistance for struggling students.Alternative methods of behavioral management have proved more effective than corporal punishmentChildren must learn to accept limits and authority.The implementation of a disciplinary policy needs to be supported by school structures and procedures.no single basic choice of approach to school discipline and safety may be appropriate for all schools.The disciplinary process must be expeditious, fair, just, corrective, consistent and educative.Discipline must be maintained in the school and the classroom to ensure that the education of learners proceeds without disruptive behaviour and offences.If the principal is conducting both the investigative and decision-making stages, he or she must be reasonable and objective.Teachers and administrators are encouraged and urged to motivate students to or for learning and behavior by means other than corporal punishment.Alternatives to corporal punishment include emphasizing positive behaviors of students, realistic rules which are enforced consistently, parent/teacher conferences about student behavior, use of staff such as school psychologists and counselors, detentions, and in-school suspension.The main aim of our pastoral care and advice will therefore be to encourage and openly acknowledge good behaviour rather than merely react to poor behaviour with punishments.Other types of discipline rather than an arbitrary reduction in credit earned should be employed when punishment is necessary.There is room within the practice of positive discipline for individuality and creativity.In May 2005, the government established the Practitioners ' Group on School Behaviour and Discipline to give independent advice to the government on how behaviour in schools could be improved.It is important to make a distinction between discipline and punishment.Students often take advantage of the substitute and this can create discipline issues.Positive reinforcement has been shown to be more effective and long-lived than aversive reinforcement.Conduct comprehensive and sustained awareness-raising campaigns among children of their rights not to be disciplined physically, including appropriate programs according to the age of the child.Schools with good discipline not only correct misbehavior but also teach appropriate behavior and coping skills.In reviewing the research measuring the effect of sanctions, codes of conduct and prevention/intervention strategies, we sought to identify research that reported on three types of effects; on the safety of all students, on the behaviour of offending students and on the overall safety of the community.taking away school internet privledges would not be a very effective punishment.Whole-class sanctions or punishments will never be used."All of the reviews and meta-analyses of boot camps and wilderness camps indicate that the temporary  shock treatment '' approach is ineffective in correcting youth behaviours."""Academic punishment, which is defined as reducing credit previously earned, shall not be used.A student 's academic grade shall be based solely on his/her achievement.Research and practical experience have taught us that, especially where young children are concerned, punishment alone is never the most effective strategy for promoting change.Nor can potentially recurring violent behavior be comprehensively addressed solely through expulsion or suspension.There is little evidence about the efficacy of the sanctions most often used by schools to respond to minor offences with the exception of extensive research on alternatives to suspension and expulsion.This review, however, found very little evidence to describe the most appropriate roles for these partners and the most effective ways to engage these partners, not only in discipline but in implementing sanctions, maintaining positive school climates or maintaining safe schools.During the teaching and educational process, the child has the right to be treated with respect by the teachers, to be informed on his or her rights, as well as on the methods of exercising these rights.Every learner has the right: To be treated fairly and the responsibility to show respect to others To be taught in a safe and disciplined school environment and the responsibility to uphold school security and be co-operative To be treated with respect by the school community regardless of personal, cultural, racial, religious or other differences and the responsibility to be tolerant and considerate of others and their beliefsAll children have a right to practice their chosen religion or lack of religion, and to be free in school of any attempt to impose someone else 's beliefs on them.Every student has the right to be happy and safe while at school.If that right is to be taken away, the school district must follow certain procedures designed to insure fairness in that decision.The following information looks at the legal rights of students in dealing with discipline and punishment in Queensland State Schools.Students shall not be denied the use of a textbook during school hours each day.There is a sizable and stable set of knowledge and case law that has been established in Canada regarding student rights and school discipline.Schwartz (1997) has noted that the U.S. Courts have been divided in their decisions about student rights under searches and seizures.both teachers and students have the right to operate in a school environment free from unsafe behaviour and harassment.Report on Physical Punishment in the United States is a peer-reviewed research report on the effects of corporal punishment in our schools.The Department of Education 's Office of Civil Rights collects data that show clearly the extent of corporal punishment and its disparate impact based on race and disability.Research on corporal punishment has shown that it may be harmful.The

negative short - and long-term physical and psychological consequences.Not only is corporal punishment abusive, it is ineffective.Supervising adults who will fully humiliate children and punish by force and pain are often causing more harm than they prevent.Research notes that corporal punishment constructs an environment of education which can be described as unproductive, nullifying, and punitive.strongly believe both physical and emotional punishment are scars that a child will carry for a long period.Research findings regarding the damaging effects for children of corporal punishment have been critiqued for methodological reasons.Corporal punishment signals to the child that a way to settle interpersonal conflicts is to use physical force and inflict pain.effects of such trauma may be compounded when a child has preexisting learning difficulties.Advocates for the abolition of corporal punishment in our schools point to the lasting damage they feel such disciplinary behavior inflicts on impressionable young minds and bodies.The Society for Adolescent Medicine concludes that corporal punishment in schools is an ineffective, dangerous, and unacceptable method of discipline.Psychologists and doctors support the adverse effects of corporal punishment.Corporal punishment may adversely affect a student 's self image and school achievement and it may contribute to disruptive and violent behaviorProvide funding for additional academic research on the effects of school-based corporal punishment.children who experience aggressive acts are more likely to counterattack.Children and adolescents can also be physically damaged by such punishment.paddling can have negative short and long term physical and psychological consequences.There are a number of studies and research that cite the negative affects of corporal punishment.Ten of the associations were negative such as with increased child aggression and antisocial behavior.The use of corporal punishment anywhere promotes bullying-even when, ironically, it is used to punish bullies.Other research suggests that the relationship between corporal punishment and adverse child outcomes is not definitive, mainly due to inconsistent definitions of corporal punishment.The American Academy of Pediatrics believes that corporal punishment may affect adversely a student 's self-image and school achievement and that it may contribute to disruptive and violent student behavior.This study supported the theory that witnessing violence enables it.Punishment is based on aversive technology and produces very limited resultsFew scientific studies draw the conclusion that corporal punishment in and of itself is bad.It is forbidden to enforce physical punishment of any kind or to deprive the child of his or her rights, which may result in endangerment of the life, the physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development, the bodily integrity, and the physical and mental health of the child, both within the family as well as in any institutions which ensures the protection, care and education of children.Learners should be protected from abuse by adults or other learners.Inhuman treatment is defined by any action that causes a bodily or emotional shock to a child, such as hitting or pushing, or inflicting any punishment that causes damage to the child, using or without the intermediary of an object, weapon or abusive physical force.It also warns against the use of strategies of humiliation and neglect in place of corporal punishment, which are also unacceptable.Corporal punishment can violate children 's rights to freedom from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, to education, and to freedom from physical violence."Corporal punishment that results in bruising, marking or other injury lasting longer than a 24-hour period may be deemed to be  unreasonable '' and thus classified as physical abuse."""Corporal punishment that is unreasonable in the circumstances may lead to intervention by police and/or child protection authorities."Punishment that is  unreasonable '' (e.g., punishment that causes harm to a child that lasts for more than a short period) may be classified as physical abuse and could lead to intervention by police and/or child protection authorities."""the New South Wales Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) establishes that corporal punishment is unreasonable if the force is applied to any part of the head or neck of a child or to any other part of the body of a child in such a way as to be likely to cause harm to a child that lasts for more than a short period.child abuse is a felony in most of the United States.Society must break the cycle of abuse by banning all forms of corporal punishment.The Catholic Church teaches that violence against another person in any form fails to treat that person as someone worthy of love.Students must be taught in an environment that clearly states they are valued and understood.Intentionally striking a child with a wooden board in most circumstances constitutes the offense of assault and battery.Any reference to giving corporal punishment to a child is to doing anything for the purpose of punishing that child (whether or not there are other reasons for doing it) which, apart from any justification, would constitute battery.If the victim of the alleged sexual harassment is a minor student and if the alleged harassment falls within the definition of abuse as found in Board 's policy JGCE, Child Abuse and Neglect, then all school employees with knowledge shall be considered mandatory reporters and the allegations must be reported to child protection or law enforcement as provided by state law and the Board policy on child abuse.In North Carolina a bill requiring parents to sign a permission slip before administering corporal punishment is under consideration.parent s prohibition of corporal punishment may be revoked at any time by submitting a separate signed, written statement.Such written and signed statement must be provided to the District each year in order to continue the prohibition of such punishment.[n] o person shall administer corporal

teacher, any other school system employee, or volunteer may use corporal punishment to discipline any student.No person may administer corporal punishment at a school to a learner;The practice of corporal punishment should be abolished throughout the education system.Punishment shall not be inflicted on students for failure or inability to learn or for trivial breaches of school

any student;No school plan for managing student behavior may authorize the use of corporal punishment.corporal punishment should be abolished immediately in the US.No employee or agent of the school district shall cause corporal punishment to be inflicted upon a student to reform unacceptable conduct or as a penalty for unacceptable conduct.legislation must be passed to abolish corporal punishment in all schools.Most leading professional associations oppose corporal punishment in all its forms."The National Association of Secondary School Principals  believes that the practice of corporal punishment in schools should be abolished and that principals should utilize alternative forms of discipline."""As views of child-rearing have changed, groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of School Psychologists and the American Medical and Bar Associations have come out against corporal punishment.no accredited teachers ' college in the U.S. advocates the use of corporal punishment.National PTA staunchly opposes violence of any kind in schools.The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry opposes the use of corporal punishment and supports legislation outlawing its use.Most private schools frown on the use of corporal punishment."The American Academy of Pediatrics  recommends that corporal punishment in schools be abolished in all states by law and that alternative forms of student behavior management be used."""Corporal punishment, as defined by paddling, slapping or otherwise physically striking a student, is not condoned or supported by the Northeastern School District.The use of corporal punishment in schools promotes a very precarious message-that violence is an acceptable phenomenon in our society.By responding violently to misbehavior, by degrading and humiliating students, and by injuring them physically and psychologically, those administering corporal punishment damage the educational environment.It sanctions the notion that it is meritorious to be violent toward our children, thereby devaluing them in society 's eyesThe use of corporal punishment in the school reinforces the notion that physical aggression is an acceptable and effective means of eliminating unwanted behavior in our society.Until corporal punishment has been banned, institute a regular statistical review process to ensure that minorities do not receive corporal punishment at disproportionate rates.Until a ban is enacted, implement a statistical review system that tracks every instance of corporal punishment.Identify possible advocates for your cause in the community.Identify school districts which are likely to ban corporal punishment with some help from your coalition.Advocates for the elimination of corporal punishment almost universally recommend that schools adopt strong disciplinary codes and standards of conduct which would give teachers and administrators the unequivocal authority they need to maintain order.Data should be collected by incident as well as by pupil punished per year.While local school districts have long since been required to keep records on their use of corporal punishment, recent legislative changes now require school districts to submit those data to the Department of Public Instruction for release in an annual consolidated report to the General Assembly.Data should also be collected on the underlying infraction that leads to corporal punishment.Revise and expand the collection of school discipline data with a particular focus on corporal punishment.Be serious and consistent about the implementation of the rulesAllow learners to take responsibilityIt is essential that you keep evaluating its effectiveness by checking the responses of learners, parents and teachers and of course, monitoring its impact.Evaluation should be an ongoing part of your disciplinary code and procedure,Know your learners and focus on relationship buildingManage the learning process and the learning environment enthusiastically and professionallyGood teaching, strong administrative leadership and long-term, school-wide planning and programs are required.School Watch programs, where students are able to report incidents anonymously, may encourage students to report incidents.Features that reduce the incidents of inappropriate behaviour and lead to improvement include: clear and efficient organisation of activities in groups, with sessions which are well timed and well spaced; mutual respect and well-established work habits through effective teamwork and clear routines; timely intervention by staff to prevent escalating poor behaviour; where necessary, constant monitoring of pupils ' welfare, comfort and positioning to maximise involvement and reduce disruption; regular feedback to individual pupils about their learning and behaviour to maintain concentration and keep them on track;Features that reduce the incidence of inappropriate behaviour include: a prompt and stimulating start to the lesson; relevant activities that engage the interest of the pupils; consistent and effective implementation of behaviour management plans.Features that reduce inappropriate behaviour include: clear and efficient organisation of activities and groups; fair and clear exercise of authority; effective support for pupils by the teacher or other adults; mutual respect and properly established work habits; an emphasis on self-discipline and mature behaviour;In schools where pupils have emotional, social and behavioural difficulties, regular and prompt reminders about individual targets for improving behaviour will be threaded throughout the teaching and behaviour reviewed and perhaps rewarded (or not) at the end of a lesson.We need to keep fighting and all violence out of our schools.Working with behavioural difficulties should be done in partnership with parents/carersSchools must have a written behaviour policy.The main goal of any disciplinary strategy is to educate children about acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.Does the policy cover the potential sanctions and how they are to be used?Students shall remain on the campus at all times unless granted permission to be off-campus, or be subject to disciplinary action.Discipline is only one part of educating children about acceptable and unacceptable behaviours.that school policies that set reasonable, clearly understood, actively enforced behavioural expectations, for students and staff can be effective in protecting the safety of all students as well as in correcting the behaviours of offending students.Obviously, should there be any doubt concerning whether or not a particular action by a school district employee has the effect of causing physical pain on a pupil, the course of action most consistent with the legislative intent would be to forego such action.Go to your school district 's website and look up the student code of conduct, which also covers policies on dress code, drugs and alcohol, and cell phone use.Incremental consequences need to be applied for some individuals.The consent, stated or implied, of the hazing victim shall not be a defense in determining disciplinary action.As a school principal it is essential that you keep your student handbook up-to-date.Indicators of consistency may be found in records of referrals and sanctions such as detention.The Elementary School Code does not state that corporal punishment is a potential punishment for any of its 21 prohibited behaviors.best policies are those included in a comprehensive approach.The Code of Student Conduct Elementary Schools (the Elementary School Code) established by the Board identifies 21 prohibited behaviors and specifies in detail the form of punishment that may be imposed as a result of violation of each prohibited behavior.Corrective action and/or punishment for misconduct must reflect good faith effort on the part of the staff.Students of all ages have begun to carry cell phones and a policy should be in place to handle this according to your district 's stance.schools that used preventive policies such as hall passes were associated with lower levels of non-serious offenses.Inspectors should establish how well the school 's expectations are known and how consistently pupils live up to them.A copy of the discipline policy shall be provided to the pupil and parent or legal guardian of every pupil enrolled in the district at the beginning of each school year.A copy of the internal rules must be given to the child,Even teaching of high quality can sometimes be subverted by disruptive pupils who do not want to learn.Occasionally, the misbehaviour of one pupil or a small group defies all reasonable strategies for managing it.In cases where a learner can not adjust to the school and where his/her behaviour is objectionable in that it violates the rights of others, he/she will be referred to the principal.Interventions aimed at rehabilitating and reintegrating offending students are also considered, including individual education plans, crisis intervention/aftermath procedures and coordinated case management.additional violation, the student is subject to disciplinary action.If the student continues to violate the policies, the problem will be referred to Yperson.The student substantially disrupts the learning process.In extreme circumstances, the principal of a school may make a submission to an appropriate authority, or to other schools, recommending the permanent exclusion of a student from the registration system of which the school is a member, or from other schools.Exclusion is the act of preventing a student 's admission to a number of schools.Discipline '' constitutes all other forms of corrective action or punishment, including brief exclusions from a class for not more than the remainder of the class period, or for up to two days or until a teacher-administrator conference is held whichever is sooner, and including exclusion from any other type of activity conducted by or for the district.Provided the teacher has done everything possible to engage such pupils, the quality of teaching should not be penalised unfairly.Loss of privileges such as membership of clubs, the right to go on certain visits, exclusion from school teams and attendance at film shows etc..The pupil will remain on the book till behaviour has significantly improved and targets achieved.Serious misconduct must be referred to the principal of the school.The Ministry, non-government Managing Authorities and their personnel shall take reasonable steps to prevent: a) students injuring themselves; b) students harassing or injuring other students; c) students harassing or injuring others; d) staff harassing or injuring others; or e) members of public harassing staff or students on school property.Educators may use reasonable measures where necessary to prevent a learner from harming him/herself or others.Corrective measures may become more severe with subsequent repeated infractions.No data was located in this search about effective ways to engage teachers (and other school staff) in the development and adoption of school discipline or conduct policies.The parent of a student disciplined for violation of this policy may appeal to the Superintendent or his/her designee no later than five (5) days after being notified of the disciplinary action."Every school should have a discipline policy or a  Behaviour Plan '' that explains the methods used by teachers and the school principal to discipline students who break school rules or behave badly."""Uniforms get credit for decrease in discipline problems.Each local board shall publish all the policies mandated by this subsection and make them available to each student and his parent or guardian at the beginning of each school year.The disciplining of our children is inextricably linked to the basic values we hold as human beings.One issue that has not been adequately considered in the research is the respective roles of education authorities in the development and adoption of school discipline rules and codes of conduct.School policies may be contrary to existing law, or there may be no policies that govern the present situation.Aleem &amp; Moles (1993) have emphasized that schools should emphasize academics, firm/fair/consistent standards and an ethic of caring.Children are less likely to test boundaries or push limits that are firmly set when they know the consequences of poor behaviourTeachers and Principals need to model the behavior they expect from children in school.Every school must have a bullying policy.In independent schools (that is, private or non-government schools) , each school can make its own rules about discipline.There is no shortage of advice on what ought to be included in school codes of conduct.Discipline shall not adversely affect specific academic grade, subject, or graduation requirements, so long as all required work is performed.Discipline in our schools.There may be inconsistencies in the application of school discipline in respect to non-serious offenses.Most participants reported that their school or school board have well-established school discipline/student conduct policies that stipulate consequences for student misbehaviours.Expectations and consequences need to be made clearer.Just as we can not neatly package any kid or situation, we can not apply an all-encompassing discipline policy.Mentioning punishment is n't necessarily a bad thing.A verbal warning should include what your expectations are concerning that behavior and the next step of action should they violate the same policy a second time.The narrow focus on violence negates the more pervasive problems of peer pressure, bullying, family, learning, and mental health problems.Many schools deferred to local law entirely and did not publish other policies that were unique to the school.only 26 (22 %) had a published policy that addressed gambling.Typical offences were disobedience, fighting, stealing from a shop, truanting, using bad language, bad work and persistent inattention, filthiness and bullying.A policy that will work in one district, may not be as effective in another district.There is emerging research that suggests that no one policy choice is best for all schools.There is much that can be done at local and state levels to advocate the ban of corporal punishment in schools.Often the battle over corporal punishment is being fought on the edges of Southern cities, where suburban growth pushes newcomers from across the country into rural and religiously conservative communities.It is most commonly used on K-8 boys in rural areas who typically come from disadvantaged backgrounds.Require school boards to revise their discipline policies regularly, and to base those discipline policies on methodologically sound studies proving the efficacy of the disciplinary methods chosen.Identify members of statewide organizations as possible advocates if their national organizations have adopted policies against corporal punishment in schools.Advocates for the retention of corporal punishment claim it is an effective deterrent in the class room.We always talk to the child before the punishment, make sure they understand why it s happening, and then talk to them again afterward.Religion also plays a role in the history of disciplining children by spanking or hitting them.Religion teaches that corporal punishment is acceptable and necessary.Christians argue that the physical discipline of a child is perfectly acceptable and withholding that can be detrimental to the child.Not only is it fast and effective, but it backs up their limits when their boundaries are crossed.The single desirable association was between corporal punishment and increased immediate compliance on the part of the child.Long thinks all schools should paddle students because he says the spankings teach students discipline and respect.Mr. Price, the middle school principal, also said corporal punishment worked.It does n't take much time to administer corporal punishment, and you do n't have to hire someone to run a detention or an after-school programSome of our school board members felt that, if it were used correctly, as it would be, corporal punishment would be yet another deterrent to keep students from misbehaving,some psychologists have found that the use of gentle physical punishment can help maintain discipline in schools.Apologists for aversive discipline suggest that the punishment must produce instant discomfort and must surprise the victim as soon as possible after the identified violationThe Center for Effective Discipline, which includes 47 Ohio organizations, has collected data and research regarding the use of corporal punishment in Ohio 's schools, and has urged lawmakers to address this issue for over 20 years.Disciplinary codes are ineffective.Many educators have found themselves in a position of not knowing what to do in the absence of corporal punishment.We need to protect kids from bullies and we need to preserve students ' due process rights.administrators and families should get the police involved so that law enforcement can help remedy violent situations in schools and protect the innocent.special agencies which are there to help young people and their parents work out their difficulties.Positive School Climates Work Day et al (1995) have cited the work of Weissberg and Elias (1993) to argue the case for a comprehensive, school-based approach to promoting student well-being and health.The appeal does not question the overall legality of corporal punishment in schools, but it contends that students should have stronger protection of the type known as substantive due process, which protects against arbitrary and unreasonable governmental conduct affecting fundamental constitutional liberties.corporal punishment of public school students is only a deprivation of substantive due process rights when it is arbitrary, capricious, or wholly unrelated to the legitimate state goal of maintaining an atmosphere conducive to learning.consider providing advocacy support for pupilsStudents need to be encouraged to report their concerns.Union County students have no more protection under the voluntary suspension of corporal punishment than they did before the suspension was implemented.Students should have a good understanding of the circumstances which they can be legally searched at school.we 've got to change the way we are meeting kids needs in the disciple process to change the direction bullies and their victims are headed.Schwartz (1997) has suggested that schools need a safety committee and coordinator.Some schools may need universal, prevention only type response, while others may require intensive protection and intervention.School should have peer support programs which utilize techniques such as Rap Groups and Sociodrama to encourage acceptable behavior.Reasonable force that is necessary to protect oneself or others is not considered corporal punishment.Physical force or constraint by a school official may be required in a limited number of carefully selected circumstances to protect students and staff from physical injury, to disarm a student, or to prevent property damage.Use of reasonable force consistent with Section B of this policy is not considered corporal punishment.Physical force or restraint which is used by a school official to protect someone from physical injury, to disarm a student, or to protect property from damage is not considered corporal punishment.It is the causing of pain which is prohibited -- not the particular method or methods by which it is caused.Making unruly students do push-ups, run laps, or perform other physical acts that cause pain or discomfort.It would seem clear that willfully causing physical pain through forced exercise is prohibited in all school contexts with the exception of the pain or discomfort which is inherent in certain types of physical education, intramural or interscholastic sports programs -- and then only to an extent which would be consistent with an appropriate training regime.The practice of utilizing physical activity (running laps and doing calisthenics) as punishment develops student attitudes that are contrary to the state objectives of CAHPERD.The point at which performing push-ups or running laps becomes corporal punishment is not clear.School boards have the authority to immediately remove a student upon a finding by school officials that the student poses a threat of harm as evidenced by prior conduct.School personnel may use reasonable force to control behavior or to remove a person from the scene in those situations when necessary:principals and assistant principals may use reasonable force in the exercise of lawful authority to restrain or correct pupils and maintain order.To quell a disturbance threatening injury to others.Stopping a student from fighting with another student.Forcing a pupil to give up a weapon or dangerous object.Physical restraint is the use of bodily force to limit a student 's freedom of movement.Students in the district are protected by law from the unreasonable use of physical restraint.Physical restraint will be used with extreme caution and only in emergency situations, after other less intrusive alternatives have failed or been deemed inappropriate.Physical restraint of a student may sometimes be necessary to protect the student or other individuals.The two goals of the physical restraint policy are: To administer physical restraint only when needed to protect a student and/or member of the school community from imminent, serious, physical harm, and To prevent or minimize any harm to the student as a result of the use of physical restraint.Physical restraint may only be used when non-physical interventions would not be effective, and the student 's behavior poses a threat of imminent, serious, physical harm to self and/or others.Restraint is the act of controlling the actions of learners when such actions may inflict harm to others or to the learner, or violate the rights of other learners or educators.Educators have full authority and responsibility to correct the behaviour of learners whenever such correction is necessary at the school.It is the responsibility of the school to determine incidents that may require disciplinary action and the nature of any penalties that may apply.Every educator is responsible for discipline at all times at the school and at school related activities.The discipline and control of students shall be the responsibility of the principal, the administrators, and the teachers.The class teacher will have the major responsibility for disciplining children in his/her care but all teachers in the school share a corporate responsibility for the discipline of all children.Periodic locker inspections will be held, and unauthorized items will be removed.The supervision and control of students should be maintained during the period while the student is in school, participating in extra-curricular or school sponsored activities, and while he/she is going to or coming from school.Search of lockers will be done if it is believed that dangerous or unlawful items are in the lockers.A school board may readmit or enroll a student suspended for an act of school violence only after a conference has been held to review the conduct that resulted in the suspension or expulsion.Board policies shall not allow students to be long‑term suspended or expelled from school solely for truancy or tardiness offenses and shall not allow short‑term suspension of more than two days for such offenses.The Board can resolve this issue by the simple act of voting to terminate its present policy.Upon recommendation of the superintendent, a local board of education may expel any student 14 years of age or older whose continued presence in school constitutes a clear threat to the safety of other students or school staff.The School Board recognizes the necessity for reasonable control and discipline over the conduct of pupils under its jurisdiction.the Board of Education does not approve of the administration of corporal punishment to students.The superintendent is directed to report annually to the board on the system 's compliance with laws and policies related to student wellness.State statute requires all public school boards, as part of the district 's written discipline policy, to include a statement on the use of corporal punishment within the district.Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any local board may refuse to admit any student who is suspended or expelled from a charter school due to actions that would lead to suspension or expulsion from a public schoolBoard policies shall not impose mandatory long‑term suspensions or expulsions for specific violations unless otherwise provided in State or federal law.The disciplinary action taken by the teacher shall be in accordance with such regulations and procedures established by the Board.Employees shall also be informed that the School Board demands compliance with both the word and intent of the law.superintendent or board shall adopt the hearing officer 's or panel 's factual determinations unless they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.Each local board of education shall determine whether corporal punishment will be permitted in its school administrative unit.Local boards of education shall adopt policies to govern the conduct of students and establish procedures to be followed by school officials in disciplining students.The introduction of automatic suspensions/expulsions for serious offenses in schools has generated considerable debate in Canada and elsewhere.Zero-tolerance is good for some students and not for others, depending upon family factors and individual circumstances.definitions and understandings of the zero-tolerance approach may vary.For the purposes of this project, a zero-tolerance policy is one that assigns predetermined consequences/sanctions (suspension) for selected serious offenses.Zero tolerance the phrase says exactly what it means: no second chances, no mistakes, no questions, no ifs, ands or buts."recently in Canada, and often in the United States, the term  zero-tolerance '' has come to mean there will be a predetermined, automatic consequence for serious infractions, with no discretion on the nature of the punishment."""Policies which punish all punching or fighting are not made for the convenience of administrators.The Education Testing Service (1999) analysis of longitudinal data shows that schools with more severe penalties had few incidents of serious infractions.Administrators were concerned about the possibility of unintended consequences of zero-tolerance policies (i.e. inappropriate suspension for a minor or single infraction) but were not aware of widespread misuse of such policies.Participants expressed concern about the possibility of inappropriate use of zero-tolerance policies but did not identify any examples of where this had happened in their experience.These policies are made to protect all students from all fighting.ZT policies represent an attempt at prevention, intervention, and avoidance of blame.Zero tolerance policies are poorly understood by many Canadians and educators.Participants struggled to develop a consistent definition of zero-tolerance policies.Further, participants noted that the severity of the incident was open to different interpretation, both by individuals having different experience levels with infractions and by the context in which the incident occurred.alternatives such as in-school suspensions, diversion programs, student courts, community service, etc. all require resources and staffing.School policies which punish every student equally involved in a school fighting incident, irrespective of fault, intentions, or actions, are WRONG.zero-tolerance policies increase the number of students who are suspended or expelled from school.Zero tolerance policies requiring suspension from school were found to be counterproductive on many levels:zero tolerance policies alone will not cure the problem of violence in schools.In some cases, children punished with maximum sanctions for rules infractions at school under zero tolerance policies have been treated much more harshly than they would have had they been charged with commensurate criminal offenses.Even school administrators are beginning to find the rigidness of these policies to be problematic.School-based administrators are more concerned with what happens before (preventive actions) and after an incident in school (support to the student and school) than rigid or prescriptive procedures to handle the crisis or to impose the sanction.While school officials may not have the right answer, they have to err on the side of caution.While not disagreeing with significant consequences for severe infractions, school principals also want to exercise their professional judgment.That report, Zero Tolerance Policies in Context: A Preliminary Investigation to Identify Actions to Improve School Discipline and School Safety, was used to create these resources that can help schools to develop their plans and policies.Policies stipulating automatic suspensions for serious offenses in school need to placed and understood within the context of other potential sanctions, sound school discipline policies/codes of conduct, positive school climates and comprehensive approaches to safe schools as well as safe communities.zero-tolerance policies are causing inappropriate sanctions for some students.Reasons include such infractions as dress code violations, talking in class or being late to school.You must be old enough to appreciate correction and the punishment must be reasonable for a child of that age.Zero tolerance with its one-size-fits-all assessment of offenses and punishments is the wrong message.child was subjected to bulling by other students that the principal failed to stop.He was then punished so serverly we had to get a court order for the Marion County School district to quit.zero tolerance policies are causing numerous adverse consequences for students, families and communities.Civil libertarians continue to criticize zero tolerance policies, arguing that they target minority and disadvantaged students.The use of group punishment in the school division is not endorsed by the School Board and its use is strongly discouraged.Schools should abandon no-fault punishment schemes"By having a blanket policy that disciplinary actions are handed out irrespective of evidence or facts, school administrators can say what the Edmond Public Schools ' principal told our friend last year:  I 'm sorry, but any student involved in a fighting incident at school is automatically suspended regardless of the circumstances."""As zero tolerance policies by nature do not provide guidance or instruction because they focus directly on punishment, such actions often are seen as unjust and may breed distrust of adult authority figures and nurture adversarial confrontational attitudes.Automatic use of suspensions/expulsions requires that additional resources be made available to other agencies and families to support youth who are expelled from school.The American Academy of Family Physicians is opposed to corporal punishment in schools.Zero tolerance policies are based on fear, mostly of lawsuits.Zero tolerances are no better than bullying."In some zero-tolerance policies, the interpretation of terms such as  weapons or objects used as weapons '', "" threats '' or "" harassment '' may be subject to interpretation."""Under many zero-tolerance policies, bringing a plastic knife to school for your lunch is equivalent to bringing a switchblade.I am not a fan of the zero-tolerance policy, especially in elementary school.There is no research-based evidence to suggest that automatic sanctions are more effective in deterring any particular misbehaviour."In contrast to zero tolerance policies, RJ is  designed to reconcile the perpetrators with the victims, creating a feeling of resolution and increasing a sense of safety."""Assuming there will also be a chat room for the students to talk in, abuse of said chat room would result in an hour/day/week / whatever of probation, during which they could not parcipate in the chat room discussions.repeated offenders could lose their chatting privledges permenantly.The lack of parental involvement in the education of their children is cited by teachers as one of the major causes of current classroom disciplinary difficultyParents, policy makers, and education officials agree that schools should provide safe and nurturing environments for all students and teachers.the local neighbourhood, parent attitudes, school staff norms and the students themselves all mix together to establish a context that may require choice from among three alternatives: universal, selected or intensive response.Among parents with minor children at home, 50 percent report that they sometimes spank their child, while 45 percent do not.Judges have made rules about physical punishment of children by their parents where punishment has been so severe that it amounted to criminal assault.Support for spanking in the schools is about the same, 31 percent, in the Midwest, falling to 19 percent in the West and 13 percent in the East.your parents/guardians could be charged with an offence if you are hurt.There is no legislation concerning corporal punishment by parents in Victoria, however, there is a common law defence for parental use of corporal punishment.Victorian common law allows parents to administer corporal punishment to children in their charge provided the punishment is neither unreasonable nor excessive.73 percent of Southerners approve of spanking children, compared to 60 percent elsewhere.Among Southerners, 62 percent of parents spank their kids; that drops to 41 percent in the rest of the country.In North Carolina, teachers and administrators are immune from any prosecution over practicing physical discipline unless the child needs medical attention.The highest number was in Texas, with 48,197 studentswhere students live should not determine whether they get spanked at school.Section 257 of the code states that: it is lawful for a parent or a person in the place of a parent .... to use, by way of correction, toward a child or pupil under his care, such force as is reasonable under the circumstances.parents should be strongly encouraged to develop alternative and positive approaches to disciplinediscussing the school 's discipline policies with their child encouraging their child to talk about school,Parental Consultation will come at an early stage if and when it becomes obvious that the child 's behaviour problem persists.Parents will be involved at the appropriate level.The input of parents and students into such policies is critical to its overall success.parents of children with and without behaviour problems reported equal levels of support that they provided to their children.programs to involve parents in reinforcing behavioural messages can reduce the number of problems.Parent required to

administrators.Spanking in schools is currently allowed in 23 states"Norway 's law allows a  light '' tap only."""30 states continue to authorize corporal punishment in their schools.Most Florida school districts have opted out of using corporal punishment, but almost every county in the state 's rural North has policies that allow schools to paddle students.North Carolina permits the use of corporal punishment in public schools.corporal punishment was administered in only nine of Union County s 34 schools during the 2003-2004 school yearCorporal punishment in schools remains legal in 22 states,Many teachers found the regulations too restrictive and actively but unsuccessfully campaigned to extend the freedom of teachers in the area of corporal punishment.Every 20 seconds of the school day, a child is beaten by an educator.Although corporal punishment is no longer tolerated in the military, prisons, or mental institutions, 21 states still allow corporal punishment in full or in part according to the U.S. Department of Education.students in the 20 states where paddling is legal in schools are often denied this fundamental right.Tennessee State Law does NOT require parental consent or notification for children to be hit with thick wooden paddles by school teachers, coaches and administrators in schools?"present the defence of  reasonable chastisement '' remains in common law."""Thirteen of our states are using the method of physical punishment in our schools today.During the 2010-2011 school year, American Indian students, who account for less than two percent of the student population statewide, received more than one-third of all corporal punishment in North Carolina public schools.While corporal punishment such as paddling, spanking and hitting students disappeared from private schools by the 1960s, it is still permitted in public schools in 20 states."The criminal defence of  reasonable chastisement '' used by way of correction, exists (or has existed) in many countries."""Students using blogs are expected to treat blogspaces as classroom spaces.Speech that is inappropriate for class is not appropriate for your blog.Whether someone believes that corporal punishment will prevent the spoiling of a child or cause them severe emotional harm, they both have one thing in mind and that is the best interest for the child.To date, neither the Department of Public Instruction nor the State Board of Education has taken a formal stance on the use of corporal punishment in public schools.Legislation in Queensland and South Australia does not explicitly state that corporal punishment is banned in schools.Possession or use of narcotics or alcohol.any U.S. college that does not maintain a drug and alcohol education program risks losing all of its federal funding.The U.S. Department of Education (1996) included a chapter on truancy prevention in its manual on safe and drug free schools.Practices and policies that we were implementing on drug laws have really taken stance in the schools.Things like having mandatory minimum sentencing laws, or having three strikes and you 're out, or the idea of aggressively policing minor offenses -- these are things that were happening as a result of the war on drugs and we were implementing these processes in schools.Students who purchase permits will be subject to random drug screening.College alcohol policies currently devote relatively little attention to student recovery;college administrators do not use empirical evidence to guide the development and implementation of student substance use and gambling regulations.Alcohol Policy Prevalence College alcohol policies varied widely.placing special emphasis on the enforcement of substance abuse policies can garner positive results.Schools that prohibited alcohol at on-campus events also evidenced significantly lower past-year student gambling rates than schools without such prohibitions:students with alcohol or gambling related disorders attending colleges with policies that interfere with treatment or fail to support recovery, the rate of relapse is likely to be higher than under a more treatment favorable public policy context.increased enforcement (i.e., application of policy consequences) of alcohol policies aimed at combating underage drinking did result in decreased alcohol consumption among students.It is not the intent of the school system to punish students who are harmfully involved with drugs, but rather to recognize it as an illness and to refer those students to proper treatment resources for rehabilitation.Courts will not usually interfere with the way a school disciplines or punishes its students.Failure to appear when summoned to Truancy Court will result in the parent (s) warrant for arrest.Teen courts, where students are involved in school discipline teams, may be one answerAll parents of children summoned to Truancy Court will be charged court costs of $ 25.several courts have determined that the district policy may also apply to student behavior off school grounds that directly interferes with the operation of the school or endangers the safety of other students or staff.BETWEEN THE CHILD AND THE GENERAL AUTHORITY OF THE SCHOOL.As a policy, students ARE NOT PERMITTED to present evidence about their guilt or innocence.Governments have responded to increased concern with new laws and regulations requiring schools to establish zero-tolerance policies, school codes of conduct, school-wide plans to prevent violence and special measures to ensure that students with behavioural disorders are managed properly.policies must consider special needs for students entitled to special consideration under the Individuals with Disabilities Educational Act.blanket policies on discipline and punishment in schools are rarely a good ideas.No-fault punishment schemes for school discipline are one area that needs reform NOW.Policies which punish a student for being the helpless victim of a violent attack at school equally with the malicious perpetrators of such an attack are WRONG,Students SHOULD be provided with an opportunity to demonstrate or prove their guilt or innocence with respect to an alleged or actual fighting incident.schools with lower rates of crime were less likely to use zero-tolerance policies.use of zero-tolerance policies has not made those schools safer, despite being in place for four years.The absence of evidence-based policy leaves school administrators in a position of promulgating policy that might have effects that are contrary to their intentions.Although the Internet provides an excellent opportunity for schools to reach technology-savvy students and parents, individuals seeking policy information on the Web are likely to face disorganization and user-unfriendly designs.such policies may result in increased disciplinary problems and dropouts in middle and high schools.Schools have the power to enforce these rules by using discipline or punishment.Each teacher may take disciplinary action to correct a pupil who disrupts normal classroom activities, who is disrespectful to a teacher, who willfully disobeys a teacher, who uses abusive or foul language directed at a teacher or another pupil, who violates school rules, or who interferes with an orderly education process.Students in detention must be attended by a teacher, administrator, or teacher assistant.Detention is a staple in many school discipline plans.The terrific thing about detention is that it is variable in many aspects including time the time of day, days spent serving, and tasks they are required to complete.Students may be detained before or after school hours for up to one hour.In Toronto, Canada, a teenage boy was arrested and detained for 34 days through Christmas and New Year s Day for writing and performing a monologue in his drama class about a harassed student preparing to blow up his school.A violation of these provisions shall be grounds for disciplinary action, including but not limited to, suspension or referral of the pupil to the juvenile court of the parish.Suspension of students with disabilities shall be in accordance with applicable state or federal law and regulations.permanent expulsion and delivery of alternate education/incarceration in institution.The principal shall provide notice to the student 's parent of any short‑term suspension, including the reason for the suspension and a description of the alleged student conduct upon which the suspension is based.Long term suspension should be used as a last resortIf the offense leading to the long‑term suspension occurs during the final quarter of the school year, the exclusion may include a period up to the remainder of the school year in which the offense was committed and the first semester of the following school year.Expulsion is used for extreme violations of school policy including the possession of weapons, assault on a school employee, drug possession and/or use, etc.."Mental Health America is on record in support of  no reject, no eject '' policies that deal with misbehavior rather than getting rid of the problem through suspension or expulsion."""The superintendent is authorized under state statute to suspend a student up to 180 days based upon the district 's disciplinary code.An expelled student may subsequently request readmission not more often than every six months.The building principal is authorized to suspend a student for up to ten days.The exclusion of a student from school attendance for disciplinary purposes for up to 10 school days from the school to which the student was assigned at the time of the disciplinary action.A principal shall recommend to the superintendent the 365‑day suspension of any student believed to have violated board policies regarding weapons.Suspensions or expulsions shall be used only for serious instances of student misconduct.A new federal program in the U.S. is awarding $ 10 million for demonstration projects that provide alternatives to suspension.Over five years, out of school suspensions have gone from over 26,000 to under 10,000.The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (1995) review of research indicates that short-term suspensions are not an effective deterrent to student misbehaviour.Expulsion '' is the exclusion from school or individual classes for an indefinite period.Long‑term suspension hearings shall be conducted in accordance with policies adopted by the board of education.All students suspended for 365 days or expelled may, after 180 calendar days from the date of the beginning of the student 's suspension or expulsion, request in writing readmission to the local school administrative unit.In Boston, a student was suspended for writing an assigned horror story in which a fictitous teacher was killed.Following the issuance of the decision, the superintendent shall implement the decision by authorizing the student 's return to school or by imposing the suspension reflected in the decision.Students who are given out-of-school suspension as a disciplinary consequence either serve a short term suspension (less than 10 days) or a long term suspension (more than 10 days)students of color were more likely to be suspended and expelled than their white peersStudents who are long‑term suspended shall be offered alternative education services unless the superintendent provides a significant or important reason for declining to offer such services.Except for in-school suspensions, any pupil suspended shall receive no credit for school work missed while suspended.If the student denies the charges, he/she must be given an oral or written explanation of the facts that form the basis of the proposed suspension; and be given an opportunity to present his/her version of the incident.Out of school suspensions were used more than anything else, rather than in-school suspension, rather than parent-teacher conferences.In matters where a long suspension, expulsion or exclusion is contemplated, the gravity of the circumstances requires particular emphasis to be given to procedural fairness.Students who are serving a suspension must remain at home during school hours or they could face truancy charges.Suspension '' is the exclusion from school, or individual classes for a specific period of time, after which the student has a right to return.At the same time, their graduation rates have reached record highs.Out-of-School suspension is a disciplinary consequence for more serious offenses.The law enables a school to cancel the enrolment of a student who is above the compulsory school ageBut Rosen also found that higher suspension rates are not clearly correlated to more frequent or more serious behavioral violations."suspending a student is one way that schools  push out '' students from schools."""Only the superintendent has the authority to long‑term suspend a student.in-school suspensions were rarely used as sanctions, despite decades of researchers and experts promoting its use.The decision of the Superintendent shall be final, except for a student expulsion, which may be appealed to the School Board in accordance with statutory provisions.A student is not entitled to appeal the principal 's decision to impose a short‑term suspension to the superintendent or local board of education.Schools with higher rates of school suspension and expulsion had less satisfactory school climate ratings and school governance structures, and tended to spend a disproportionate amount of time on discipline.If the offense leading to the long‑term suspension occurs before the final quarter of the school year, the exclusion shall be no longer than the remainder of the school year in which the offense was committed.In-school suspension means removing a pupil from his/her normal classroom setting but maintaining him/her under supervision of the school.decision on readmission under this subsection shall be issued within 30 days of the petition.The notice shall be given by certified mail, telephone, facsimile, e‑mail, or any other method reasonably designed to achieve actual notice.Failure or refusal by a pupil to participate in assigned detention shall subject the pupil to immediate suspension.If the suspension is in excess of ten days or an expulsion, state statute requires that the school must provide the student with appropriate due process.Northampton County Schools does have a policy concerning corporal punishment.The parents of students who attend Northampton County Public Schools voiced their concerns on a social networking site after receiving a memo about corporal punishment in the school system.It includes, but is not limited to, spanking, paddling and slapping.Corporal punishment refers to intentional application of physical pain as a method of changing behavior."In schools, physical punishment is usually described as  corporal punishment ''.""""Corporal punishment ranged from a single stroke on the hand to four  on the seat '' for offences which were considered more serious such as bad language or filthiness."""Halting corporal (physical) punishment.Corporal punishment is defined as the use of physical force towards a child for the purpose of control and/or correction, and as a disciplinary penalty inflicted on the body with the intention of causing some degree of pain or discomfort, however mild.reasonable physical force may be used upon a student as necessary to maintain order and control in a school or school related setting for the purpose of providing an environment conducive to safety and learning.School administrators should consider all of the educational, psychological, and physical implications of using physical exercise as punishment before allowing such a practice.corporal punishment is the intentional infliction of physical pain as a method of changing behaviorCorporal punishment is the intentional infliction of physical pain upon the body of a student as a disciplinary measure.Corporal punishment is a discipline method in which a supervising adult deliberately inflicts pain upon a child in response to a child 's unacceptable behavior and/or inappropriate language.A teacher or school principal may use reasonable force when it is necessary under the circumstances to correct or restrain a student or prevent bodily harm or death to another.Excessive force includes force that results in injury to the child that requires medical attention beyond simple first aid.Corporal punishment is defined as, and limited to, punishing or correcting a student by striking the student in the buttocks with a paddle a maximum of five (5) times.Corporal punishment is not just a school issue involving students, but is a societal issue involving families and cultures.Specifically mentioned were ' boxing children 's ears ' and unnatural and long-continued attitudes of restraint such as standing or kneeling.Corporal punishment is all forms of physical punishment including, but not limited to, spanking, paddling, or slapping.Corporal punishment means the deliberate infliction of physical pain by hitting, paddling, spanking, slapping, or any other physical force used as a means of discipline.Comprehensive anti-bullying and anti-violence programs have also been demonstrated to be effective.The school district shall take appropriate action in response to a report following an investigation of any alleged bullying, intimidation, threatening behavior, harassment, or hazing of a student.We ca n't command away the impulse to bully or command away a child 's unhappiness and anger.Day et al (1995) conducted a survey of Canadian school board policies.One-third (30 %) used a behavioural expectations approach,Special Policies for Students With Behaviour DisordersRecently, the federal government in the U.S. has passed a law stating that all schools receiving federal funds for students with disabilities are required to implemented PBS and FBA procedures.Discipline of students with disabilities shall be in accordance with policy JDF, Discipline of Students With Disabilities.disability status of each student, the duration of suspension for each student, whether alternative education was considered or services were provided for each student, and whether a student had multiple suspensions in that academic year.We also look for policies that have been adapted to meet the needs of students with behavioural disorders and students who are at high risk of offending.Research into the relationship between the characteristics of the school - (urban, suburban, rural, SES, etc.) and the appropriateness of sanctions and specific school rules should be conducted.Research needs to determine if violence is a step-by-step continuum or if there is a direct pathway to serious offenses.Research should be conducted into the prevalence of use of in-school suspensions.Research into different contexts and different types of schools (urban, rural, suburban, etc.) needs to be done to validate emerging hypotheses that differentiation of policy/program resources should be done.There is a shocking absence of descriptive or evaluative research on the role of students, parents, other agencies and ministries, the police and law enforcement ministries, the role of senior school district administrators/trustees, education ministries.Research into the differentiation of policy/program responses to non-serious and serious offenses should be done.More research is required on how schools can work effectively with social services, and juvenile court personnel in regards to the role of the school in diversion, alternative and reintegration plans.Alternate schools were often a big part of these programs.alternate schools for troubled youth can be effective if they are adequately supported.The Southwest Regional Educational Laboratory (1995) has identified similar characteristics of the effective alternate schools, including a student choice to be involved, a focus on the whole student, caring relationships, an expanded role for the teacher into caregiving, a sense of community, high expectations of students, small size, relative autonomy, comprehensive program, counseling, safe environment, separation from traditional schooling, links to agency services.Effective programs provide anger and impulse control training, psychological counseling, effective academic and remedial instruction, vocational training, active family involvement, guidance and ongoing support when the student returns to regular school.Restitution is Effective Gottfredson et al (1996) reviewed several school and community-based restitution programs and concluded that this approach was effective in correcting the behaviours of young offenders.Gluckman (1996) suggests that dress codes can reduce gang activity in the school.Despite the mixed evidence, school uniforms and dress codes appear to be making a comeback.Students are responsible for completing all work missed during absences.Students missing school as a result of any suspension shall be counted absent and shall be given failing grades in those subjects for the days missed with no make-up work allowed.Should the principal fail to act on any report of misconduct or school violation, he/she shall explain the reasons for doing so to the Superintendent or designee and to the teacher or school employee reporting the violation.In any case where a teacher, principal, or other school employee is authorized to require the parent, tutor, or legal guardian of a pupil to attend a conference or meeting regarding the pupil 's behavior, and after notice, the parent, tutor, or legal guardian willfully refuses to attend, the principal, or his designee, shall file a complaint, in accordance with statutory provisions, with a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction.Principals shall have both the authority and the duty to take disciplinary action whenever the behavior of any pupil (s) materially interferes with or substantially disrupts the maintenance of a proper atmosphere for learning within the classroom or other parts of the school.Any teacher or other school employee may report to the principal any pupil who acts in a disorderly manner or is in violation of school rules, or any misconduct or violation of school rules by a pupil who mayor may not be known to the teacher or employee.The principal and other appropriate personnel shall be required to file written documentation of all suspensions.If removed, the student shall not receive credit for school work missed.The principal shall review and act upon such information submitted, to determine if suspension or other disciplinary action is necessary.A pupil may be imn1ediately removed from a classroom by the teacher and placed in the custody of the principal or designee if the pupil 's behavior prevents the orderly instruction of other pupils, poses an intermediate threat to the safety of pupils or the teacher, or when a pupil exhibits disrespectful or threatening behavior toward a teacher.Whenever a pupil is formally accused of battery of a school employee, the pupil, in addition to any other discipline given, shall be immediately suspended by the principal, with the necessary procedures to follow as soon as possible.principal shall file copies of his/her report with the Superintendent, other appropriate personnel and the parent or guardian and retain a copy for his/her records.Teachers do not punish children with reading and then expect them to develop a joy for reading.A copy of this resolution and policy on the use of corporal punishment shall be distributed to parents and students and shall become a part of the discipline policy handbook.Punishment is based on the belief that if children are made to suffer for doing wrong, they will not repeat their inappropriate behaviour.Punishing children when they do wrong seems to be one important way of doing this.Bad behaviour had to be punished and a record was kept in the school 's punishment book.when teachers convert into punishment the same activity which they are trying to have students interpret as valuable to their lifelong health, all positive educational and logical principles have been abandoned.Another parent complained in 1977 that there was no right of appeal against corporal punishment, which was a form of violence no longer used in prisons.These restrictions were in response to changes in accepted educational theory and practice, and protests from parents about excesses in the administration of corporal punishment.An illegal search and seizure could cost the school a lot of money,Horner et al (2000) suggest that schools should identify, define, teach and support a small set of expected behaviours rather than presenting students with a laundry list of unacceptable behaviours.Fifteen per cent of those crimes occurred on school propertyNotice '' of the conference, specifying the time and date of the conference, shall be given by contacting the parent, tutor, or legal guardian by telephone at the telephone number shown on the pupil 's registration card or by sending a certified letter to the address shown on the pupil 's registration card.The existence of school surveillance cameras, as were present in the case of Rachel Davis, SHOULD be considered by school officials in determining the appropriate disciplinary course of action to follow with involved students.Teachers will tell you that some of these kids come to kindergarten far behind other students simply because they are not given the same intellectual stimulation.corporal punishment could not be used for failure or inability to learn.Abuse of the PM system would result in PM probation for a given amount of time.Bring back caning the backs of the mess ups - let them be known everywhere they go as the ones with stripes and let them wear them proudly and publically so others may know they are stubborn and dedicated to not learning anything.BETWEEN THE CHILD AND HIS/HER SCHOOLWORK OR HOMEWORK.The purpose of this policy is to describe limitation on corporal punishment of students.Zero-tolerance was not discussed.Queensland was the only State that specifically excluded the first two years of schooling,This bill limits the sale of certain beverages and foods in public elementary and secondary schools during specified time periods.Crime Prevention in Schools.Many parents who use this type of punishment in their homes actually prefer it to be utilized at school.
====================== 1035_gold_opti.txt.xml ======================
Depression is n't just bad moods and occasional melancholy.There is no single reason why people get depressed.three main factors: How a person thinks, outside factors and a biochemical imbalance.Too much negative thinking can make it easier to become depressed.Having a parent who gets depressed can increase someone 's chances of becoming depressed.When a parent experiences clinical depression, his/her children are affected.Maternal depression, however, was determined to be a possible risk factor.The researchers found that although children whose mothers had a history of depression had the same amount of negative emotions as other kids their age, they had fewer displays of positive or happy emotions.Depressed parents may also struggle to help their children regulate their own emotions, which may lead to poor social emotional development.About 25 percent of kids whose mother and father showed signs of depression had emotional or behavioral issues.Studies show that children of depressed parents run a higher risk not only of developing depression themselves, but also a higher risk of problems with bonding, anxiety, physical health, academic performance, problems with peers, poor self-esteem, attention deficits, aggressive behavior, and language delaysThe study also suggests that kids whose parents both seem depressed are at particularly high risk.The numbers do n't

Launch 1 Red introduces children to some of the basic beliefs of Christianity:I have had some difficulties with local Christians attempting to persuade children at my son 's state school to attend a group they have at lunch time37 percent of the Christian schools indicating religious development as their top education goal said academic excellence was their second most important one.Currently there is an over-representation of Christianity in state schools and I request that the needs of non-religious families be catered for as well.Some believe that maintaining a Christian identity is done at the level of teachers and administrators, and they see their mission as enveloping Christian and non-Christian students alike.As a consequence, all of us, Christians and non-Christians alike, have a moral responsibility to support, strengthen and reform the public schools.Christianity has no more claim to knowledge [or practice] of good and bad, right and wrong than any cult, creed, or power-hungry gang throughout human history.Shame on Alan Jones on Sunrise this morning supporting Christian indoctrination in government schools.even the Christian viewpoint is biased.The promotion of a particularly narrow religious view afforded by fundamentalist Christian Chaplains in a multicultural and multi-denominational society is unacceptable.What is noticeably Christian about Christian schools is the content of the curricular materials they use."We are Seventh-day Adventist Christians and many of the beliefs taught in the RE curriculum are  wrong '' according to our doctrine."""Different choices of school activities in religious schools according to studies that students who involve in extracurricular activities are more likely to steer clear from bad influences in the society including drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol.The Bible may be taught in a school, but only for its historical, cultural or literary value and never in a devotional, celebratory or doctrinal manner, or in such a way that encourages acceptance of the Bible as a religious document."These Bibles would then be used as textbooks in literature classes  without devotional or denominational purpose."""Being able to read, including to read the Bible, helps children make informed life choices.The Supreme Court has also held, however, that the study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education (e.g., in history or literature classes) , is consistent with the First Amendment.Many schools portray their Bible classes as social studies or literature courses,Some schools are divided from within, as even the most devout conservative Protestants struggle to figure out exactly what the Bible has to say about whether the classroom environment should be more authoritarian or egalitarian and whether schools should focus on the advancement of all students or expend special resources on the academically gifted-or on those who lag behind.They betray the faith families place in public schools by misusing Bible courses to promote their own narrow religious beliefs over all others.Do they understand how to do so without representing the Bible as a devotion or denominational instruction?The Bible may be studied as literature, but not as religious doctrine.Bible reading is encouraged.On the heels of Spiderman looms Bibleman, fighting the dastardly with doses of Scripture.The Bible, apparently, can justify several very different schooling strategies.97 % of the SRI teaching is ChristianityThere seems to be a growing Christian presence in state schools too.Are Chaplains obliged to ' believe ' in a fundamentalist view of Christianity?The ' Nuremburg ' defence of only following existing Government policy (Orders) is not at all good enough in sidestepping the rationale for continuing with the Christian Chaplaincy program.The fact that the majority of the members of the committee are either staunch Christians or have been raised in Christian households produces a level of bias that can not be reasoned with.The Department of Education effectively privileges and promotes this group of Protestant Christians over all other faith-based religions or beliefs with the active encouragement of ACCESS.Christians can embrace the opportunity to provide well-trained teachers to clearly explain the message of the gospel to children.As Christians, we must make real our commitment to children and to the welfare of all our neighbors and our communities.In a deeply Christian area, he gets persecuted for being atheist?Other religions have complained of a '' Christian bias '' in Victorian religious education and funding.This teaching concerns only the Christian god, as presented by these particular Christian groups.The Election Programmes of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Demokrat Party (DP) are silent about religious education, which implies that they are satisfied with the current practice and do not wish to introduce any changes.calls to reject entirely any religion classes polarise society and cause the discussions to revolve around whether or not to have religion lessons, rather than on the content.Principal Hendricks said he was familiar with AIA and said he would stop the assembly program if any religious language was used.Only those faiths considered to be the ' main religions in the school community ' will be provided with State-funded faith-formation teachers, and those that do not qualify will be taught a common ethics programme.I think one can dress this up in as many ways as they can possibly think but this is segregation of children based on religious beliefs.Supporters of the Access Ministries program say it has been unfairly criticised, and that for many pupils the program is the only introduction to Christianity and its values.ACCESS is a political lobby who have lobbied to put religion in the schools by statute and regulation.Nor may school officials grant religious speakers preferential access to public audiences, or otherwise select public speakers on a basis that favors religious speech.The Equal Access Act provides a statutory basis for claims for and against extra-curricular religious clubs."The question here is n't whether ACCESS is incompetent at bringing children to Christ in Australia 's largest  mission field '' (aka, the schools) it is whether they are breaking the law by violating important rights that families and children have in our country.""""Equally unconstitutional was an  equal access '' plan under which student volunteers could recite prayers of their own choosing as part of a pre-game ceremony."""Most of the schools I visited made special efforts-including offering reduced tuition-to reach out to African-American churches to increase the racial diversity of their schools.Simply enrolling children from different cultures does not make a school multi-denominational.We believe that the more religious schools there are, the more children will be separated by religious (and, therefore, often racial, and sometimes sectarian categories) at a very formative time in their lives.faith schools should be required to support tolerance and integration.The main point though is that parents from faith traditions (other than catholicism) should feel they are being valued and respected for who they are.Creating an environment beyond the classroom that signals the inclusive community we seek to be will not isolate any Nursery families because of religious beliefs and practices.Teaching people about other religions (which yes you learn about in a catholic school) is a great way to learn about different cultures and teach respect to others beliefs.You ca n't expect a child to leave their religious identity at the school door because they 're afraid to mention it.Parents are the primary religious educators of their children.Parents, by and large, are expected to choose or reject schools on the basis of what communal leaders and key funders have determined for them.If other parents want their kids to be indoctrinated in religion at school that 's their business but I do n't see why it should prevent my children from continuing to get an education during this time.Parents have differing requirements depending on factors such as their religious observance, whether their child has particular special needs or their geographical distance from a preferred school.There are many parents who are feeling pressured to conform and do not want their children feeling isolated or outcast.While a number of parents spoke positively about the attractions of formal Jewish education, others raised concerns that their children could become too insular and isolated from the ' real world ' if they did not mix with those from other religious and cultural backgrounds.Parents may choose a date if their child is enrolled in the Religious School and is at least 10 years old or in fourth grade.Parents were also aware of the difficulties of recruiting suitably qualified Jewish studies staff.Some parents, social commentators, academics and spiritual leaders worry that children are given a predominantly Christian perspective without reference to others.But the faith most people have is based on where they are born and who their parents are - it is factors that have nothing to do with the choice a child makes.The community national schools provides for faith formation in line with the wishes of parents and that 's very important.A number of parents, though not all, believed that there was not enough easily accessible information available to help them make the best choices.most parents take little or no interest in general school matters that they perceive as unrelated to their own children.In other words, provided the requirements of s. 84 (8) are met, parents could petition for Buddhist religious exercises, Jewish religious exercises, the traditional Christian religious exercises, or other.Children of nominally Christian parents, a large proportion of society, more than elsewhere in their lives, experience exposure to specific religious induction.Many international newcomers are surprised at how involved American parents are with their children 's elementary schools.Which is sort of the point of this debate, parental rights vs. states rights.parents/guardians making the petition will be responsible for providing whatever prayer books, literature, etc., are essential to the conducting of the religious exercises.What parents like in catholic boarding schools include strong emphasis on character education?The documents show parents, the majority of whom are immigrants with little or no experience of the Irish education system, frequently looking for more information and more of a say in the design of the religious education programme.The principle derived here is that a parent can not enforce the consequences of their religious belief on a child who may as an adult choose to reject that religious belief, let alone a life or death situation.Many parents who are not members of a particular faith value the structured environment provided by schools with a religious character.There are parents of children in the public schools who do not want their children exposed to any religious evangelism in school regardless of which religious message is being preached.If a parent does not want their child to attend SRI, the child can be removed from the class but this effectively punishes the child by refusing to allow him or her to receive any other form of (secular) education while other students are undergoing SRI.Following your query, parents at Victoria Point State High school will be reminded that they are able to notify the Principal confidentially if they do not wish their child to be involved in activities led by the chaplain.Children would benefit in adulthood from knowledge of the world as a diverse population if they were taught, by their parents, that there is a completely different world beyond the confines of the xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.Parents do have the right to remove their children from religious education but the argument is that we should n't be forced into the making this choice in the first place."one parent described the teaching of religion in the school as a  planned takeover"""classes forced parents to lay out our religious beliefs in public by asking children to opt in or opt out.If the parents want religion taught in school for their children, it has to take place outside of the school day.I don '; t think the parent should have the choice as to what their children learn.Good process should then provide parents a fair chance to decide what they want.Parents and/or the student should approach the teacher beforehand to indicate absence for a religious holiday.Parents need to be able to judge whether or not to permit their children to receive lessons after they are notified as to the qualifications and theological stance of the instructor who is timetabled for their child.Surely parents should have the right to remove their children from religious education if they want; given the current laws.Parents simply want the right to form their children 's religious identity without the help of parachurch missions which raid the Government and come up with insane and deeply misleading policy to impose on everyone.Parents typically value two aspects of Jewish day schools above all: first, academic standards (which for some parents were considered ' the bottom line ') and, second, the socialization of children in the ways of Judaism.How parents want their children to be ' Jewishly ' educated varies principally according to their own levels of religious observance, which in turn reflect differing emphases on the importance of social, cultural and religious aspects of Judaism.I am advised that a number of students did not attend the ceremony as their parents had requested their non-participation on religious or conscientious objection grounds.Where parents request special religious instruction in a particular faith that is not provided at the school, principals should advise parents that such instruction can only be scheduled where the particular religious group provides an accredited instructor who is approved by the Minister for Education.Parents are expected to supervise their own children unless in a class or signed into childcare.I deeply feel it is a form of discrimination on the grounds of the child parents ' personal views of the world.Parents choosing schools on grounds of religion is deemed acceptable - and there is a liberal argument that parents should be able to choose a religious education for their children if they so desire - whereas schools choosing parents on religious grounds is not.Parents or caregivers under Section 33 of the Act are entitled to exempt their children from either or both of these classes.The results were predictably varied, in some cases parents were satisfied that the child did benefit, in others they were disappointed and felt there was little improvement.Parents pick and choose religious boarding schools specifically for the reason that they assimilate knowledge about the Catholic devotion in the curriculum.Schools of a religious character are in demand by parents.Many parents indicated that they wanted their children to attend a school where they would meet members of the other community since they believed that this would help to develop better relationships across the whole community.It allowed me to question the views of people my parents age that had never gone school with children from that background.Parents at this meeting complain that they have not been consulted, despite having been promised that they would be.Parents who possess an attitude of cheerful expectancy about weekly church attendance have less difficulty keeping children involved.The groups of parents supporting ethics classes are often described as ' non-religious parents ' while those against ethics classes are grouped as ' faith parentsWe would suggest that the relationship between parent and school engendered by this type of structure can be narrow and one-sided.Parental involvement is a key ingredient to the success of our program, and reinforces the importance of church in your child 's mind.Another parent also described how she had originally sent her young son to a central Orthodox Jewish school, but found it extremely awkward when it came to socializing with other children:It is hard to object to parents ' wish to influence their children 's education or to condemn an organisation which has as one of its central aims the desire to improve community relations and end sectarian violence.Parents are assured that their students get the fair share of quality education that most parents want from their children.if you are a parent who has difficulties these past days because of your teen 's defiance, it is up to you to whether choose military schools or religious schools for your child 's transition.Obviously the parents would not particularly want to send their children to a school of another religionIn Quebec, Catholic and other parents opposed to the new, mandatory program in ethics and religious culture (ECR) have launched court cases aiming to give parents a choice in religious education.Parents found themselves having either to learn new skills or seek out those who could provide them.Two parents, whose eldest child had attended a Jewish primary school but was now a pupil at a non-Jewish secondary, believed that it was at this transitional stage in the educational cycle that children had to move away from the ' safety ' and ' protection ' of a Jewish environment:With the exception of parent-elected governors, the style, running and ethos of Jewish voluntary day schools -- and even more so for independent schools -- are determined by a ' top-down ' approach.As a parent I have a right and duty to intervene if a teacher wants to advocate immoral or atheistic views and try to indoctrinate my child.Church teaching and tradition is that parents are the first educators of their children.the parents seemed especially anxious that their children should know about the other community, its traditions, religious beliefs and so on.Many of these parents came from relatively hard-line working class Protestant backgrounds, and they did not see their child s attendance at an integrated school as conflicting with their loyalist political views or as threatening their children s identity.As a parent or guardian, your active participation in our ministry to children and youth is expected.Faith schools which are their own admission authorities are ten times more likely to be highly unrepresentative of their surrounding area than faith schools where the local authority is the admission authority.In ' Faith in the System, ' the Government and religious groups confirmed their commitment to continue to work together - and with schools with and without a religious character - to improve the life chances of children, to build bridges to greater mutual trust and understanding and to contribute to a just and cohesive society.The main problem with faith schools is that their primary purpose is to socialise women into their major roles of wives and mothers.I worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to British society.That faith schools have on average supposedly higher grades is one reason the Labour Government has been a supporter of them.This document has been produced by the Accord Coalition, of which Ekklesia is a founder member, to help researchers, journalists, campaigners and members of the public to find information about some of the policy implications of state funded faith schools and their practices.The aim is to bring together and summarise high quality research from reliable sources, pointing in particular to the shortcomings of faith schools and where changes need to made, particularly in the area of admissions and employment.Staff in secondary and primary faith schools are only half as likely to say that homophobic bullying is a serious problem in their schools compared to staff in non-faith schools.government should not be funding faith schools of any kindEither we allow all faiths to provide education if they can do so allowing society to become further segregated.Faith schools receiving state funding should therefore lose the right to select pupils on religious grounds.Turkey should consider approaching the matter in a holistic manner.The Bloc instead proposed history of religions and religious studies as optional lessons.Many in Turkey argue that further reform of primary and secondary school education to facilitate freedom of religion or belief is necessary.The government 's Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) can offer summer courses on reading the Quran for children who are older than 12, with state funding.It seems to strive to be both a course on teaching Islam and a course on religions and it is not working.Turkey has the obligation to respect the rights of children to freedom of religion or belief and to respect the rights of parents to educate their children in line with their beliefs.If you look carefully at the blog I am attacking the selection of pupils on the basis of religion.It provides a public service and as such should not discriminate places on the basis of religion.Social cohesion and use of tax payers money where children are excluded based on faith would therefore be my two greatest concerns."They can also pray in a  nondisruptive manner '' when they are not participating in school activities or are being taught."""No one religion would be favored in a public school system.getting a day off school for a religious holiday is a right that would fall under the First Amendment.They are also not allowed to discourage an activity because it is religious, nor can they solicit or encourage anti-religious activity.They leave the shelter of home but ill equipped for what may meet them at its very threshold, deficient too often not merely in the knowledge of biblical facts, but in guiding principles of action.At our public schools in England I venture to think we have the claims of morality most admirably enforced, but as a rule there is too little organized instruction in doctrine.In the meantime, traditional religious people in this province are nervously reading many different signs coming out of Victoria and wondering whether we are not now entering a new era of religious persecution, one in which traditional religious voices are to be increasingly and aggressively marginalized and stifled by the provincial government.This prohibition has led courts to ban such plainly coercive religious activities in public schools such as organized prayer and the teaching of creationism.However, religious music, literature, art or other religious activities should not dominate school activities.These activities are permissible only if they make up a small portion of a school-sponsored event.For instance, on a board filled during the winter months with images of snowflakes, candles and evergreen trees, it might be appropriate to add images of Santa Claus and even a Chanukah menorah because the overall message is clearly a celebration of the season, not the promotion of a religious point of view.At Ormond Primary a local Anglican priest, the Reverend Kevin Pedersen, has gained access to the school to teach weekly 30-minute classes to the younger students, despite not being invited initially by the principal or the school council.We also caution that government aid to primary and secondary religious schools raises constitutional problems, and could undermine the schools independence and/or compromise their religious message.Provincial and national organizations are helpful, but they ca n't take on roles that properly belong to parents themselves.It was a perverse paradox Complements lesson themes and current departmental policy helps children explore their own lives for meaning and purpose provides some understanding of the stories, festivals, worship, and symbols of the Christian faith in the community respects children 's rights to uphold their own opinions while providing a broader understanding of this major influence on contemporary Australian culture.We specifically asked parents if there were issues relating to integrated education which were causing them concern.There is little doubt that many parents in the integrated schools were more than satisfied with the level of involvement which they had achieved in this way and that both they and the teachers considered it to be beneficial to the children.Parental involvement in the integrated schools can not therefore be defined in straightforward or definitive terms.There are also sub-committees of the parent s council and the governing body to deal with specific issues such as the religious education provision and curriculum.Discussions of homosexuality should only be handled by the parents because not everyone has the same levels of tolerance or acceptance of the same sex lifestyle.It is beyond question that Good News intends to use the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of Christian conversion.Parents should help a kid deal with theories, not restrict their learning.Catering to each individual parent 's wishes/beliefs/ignorances would be a ridiculous nightmare.Nothing breeds misunderstanding and discrimination more than people who simply are not educated on differences between people and religions.The aim of achieving equity and community cohesion which takes into account the needs of religious groups and those of no religious affiliation should be based on a reciprocal approach where all schools whatever their existing status play their part in achieving those aims.Parents desire their children to enroll to this kind of educational institution because the clear meaning and target associated in the curricula as well as to their set of programs are enough confirmation to support their children upbeat growth.To enroll them particularly in religious boarding schools, the students and their families will be introduced and be re-introduced to welcome Christ in their lives.We would not however wish to restrict the freedom of county schools to make provision for collective worship if it seems appropriate and is acceptable to their pupils and parents.Clearly if the provision of religious education (instruction) continues to be required by law, and if there is a likelihood that the provision made may adopt a confessional approach, based on a Christian dominated agreed syllabus, then the right of withdrawal must be retained.If religious education is indeed regarded as such an important aspect of education, it seems difficult to accept the case for legally providing for pupils to be withdrawn from it.The CNS approach, variously called '' Multi-belief '' or '' Multi-faith '' by those designing it, aims to provide faith formation.In 2008 almost 80 % of pupils in the two brand new CNS schools were not Catholics.Religion is the means by which an elite group gains control of the population.Education is about giving factual information to children, in preparation for being productive and happy adults.religious education has a place in the educational scene on educational grounds.I actually would like to see NO scripture in public schools at all, if people want to raise their kids religiously, they should enrol them in a religious specific school or do it on their own time.Religion may be presented as part of a secular educational program.It should be noted that ideological education really developed more in higher education (think of the founding of the London School of Economics) with universities having a left or right wing reputation.Religious education in the integrated schools is provided partially through a common curriculum which seeks to emphasise shared Christian values.They think an education within a religious school will help their kids become moral upstanding members of their community.In the present circumstances religious education is seen as an educationally valid component of the school curriculum, subject to the same disciplines as other areas of study.The aim of religious education is to provide children with such a width and depth of religious experience and thinking that they have a thorough background knowledge from which they can draw in their quest for the meaning of life.The historical legacy of Churches providing education is not one that works; how many things would not be changed if we invoked the habit to which something occurred in the past and thus should continue.it is illegal for an government agency to insist on a child regularly attending a Christian church.Christian schools run by a board of parents from several different churches tend to differ in important ways from schools subsidized and run by a particular church.The confessional approach to religious education can be seen as the traditional view of the role of the school in relation to religion which was without doubt the approach which the framers of the 1944 Education Act had in mind in requiring schools to provide ' religious instructionThe question here is whether the church should have a state legislated right to operate a youth ministry endorsed by the Minister of Education in the government schools,Both the debate over school choice and the general controversy over whether religious education can serve public purposes might benefit from understanding just how much diversity there is within the Christian-schools movement.they have no right to deny religious education to those who want it.Because of the importance of Judaic education generally in the ethos and missions of schools, teacher shortages and a lack of qualifications in this area are of prime concern.As someone that is concerned about the separation of church and state you have to appreciate where I am coming from on this; I am not belittling your experience or diminishing you because you went to a faith school.One can only begin to imagine the consequences of learning all faith claims without bias or prejudice - perhaps that is why Religious Education is still not regulated by the National Curriculum.State education should not be financing religious establishments,I do not think that a tax paid institution of education should be able to select pupils on the basis of faith.I am quite happy for those who wish their child to have a religious education, whatever that religion may be, to have access to their faith, however I do feel that the best qualified people to do this are the parents themselves and the leaders of the parents ' church/faith.Discussion of the practice of religious education must however take place against the background of the complex legal framework prescribed by the 1944 Education Act.Deepening the social divisions in this country further with a widening religious divide in education is going to fracture society further.For example, in areas where there are a lot of Church schools, people who go to church get a far better deal than people who do not.We need to educate our children about the full range of religions that matter to us, and respect the basic point that families have a fundamental right in how their children are religiously instructed but that this should be outside of the normal school curriculum.Integral to each class session is an understanding of the gospel message of Jesus Christ; it 's application to their lives as Catholic Christians, and the teachings and traditions of our church.Religious education of young people takes place at home or in places of worship as part of religious activity.Any attempt by educational institutions to transmit a sectional view as if it were the only publicly defensible one would contradict the value a democracy ascribes to individual judgement and responsibility.These activities should neither compete with SRE nor be alternative lessons in the subjects within the curriculum or other areas, such as, ethics, values, civics or general religious education.Religious education shares with other subjects the task of helping children to acquire the skills, knowledge and social competence necessary for their personal development and life in societyin religious education, the school is operating on the boundary between itself and the local community in that it is dealing with the religious traditions, beliefs and values of the society in which it is setWe discussed with religious education teachers their views on how their own religious convictions could and should affect their teaching.The majority of religious education teachers whom we met, in schools with multi-faith pupil populations, were in favour of the phenomenological approach to religious education which we ourselves have advocated.Our religious philosophy at Episcopal Day School is to be a Christian School that seeks both to nurture our Christian students in their faith and nurture the spiritual and moral lives of our students of all faiths and traditions."Evangelicals usually leave public schools reluctantly and see Christian schools as a stopgap measure in these  troubled '' times.""""While it is my son 's (my youngest child) final year of primary school I was dismayed to discover that the endorsement of Christianity is alive and well at the local (public) high school, complete with  trendy '' chaplain, promotion of youth group (where participants talk in tongues) , and free bible giveaway."""I have just entered into my fourth formal grievance process with the department on the conduct and implementation of christian seminars at my children 's public primary school.only a small minority of conservative Christians take the stance that Christian kids should be in Christian schools as a matter of principle.Christ-centered values are emphasized as schools focus on the development of the whole person.The Church of England was the provider of education before the State was.In February 2006 representatives of the Church of England, the Roman Catholic Church, the Muslim Council of Britain, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist organisations signed a declaration that, in addition to teaching their own religion, schools should promote awareness of the ' tenets ' of other faiths.It appears that most of the apparent advantage of faith school education in England can be explained by differences between the pupils who attend these schools and those who do not.The right to be treated fairly begins with an education to children and society about our differences.Religious Education did present particular problems for the primary schools where few teachers were specialists.Religious Education at the primary school is not compulsory, nor is it part of the school curriculum.Yet public education has been under attack for over two decades by persons representing religious, cultural, and economic views which offer little or no support for public schooling.Religious education at this level should be concerned with laying the foundations to enable children to develop attitudes towards all faiths and belief systems based on appreciation, interest and respect.To create a Church of England School in Ealing now is to invite racial trouble.This ambivalence is clearly seen in the attitude of the churches, particularly the Roman Catholic church, which on the one hand supports the right of parents to choose the appropriate education for their children but on the other seeks to ensure that all Catholic children are educated in Catholic schools.That separation of a non-religious child during religious education be handled in an insightful manner, with proper alternatives suppliedStudents in religious schools are given the chance to stem out and explore their interests in the course of sports.We are purely acknowledging the fact that modern day society is completely unlike the 1950s when the education department laws were enacted allowing for religious education in public schools.Many identified strong leadership as a key factor in the success of their children 's education, although others identified this as more of an area of concern.As we have explained, we believe that the phenomenological approach to religious education reflects most closely the aims underlying ' Education for All ', in laying the foundations for the kind of genuinely pluralist society which we envisaged at the opening of this report.One issue canvassed in the consultation paper was whether bodies such as the Humanist Society should be permitted to deliver classes to students in the time set aside for religious education classes.The Catholic Education Service appears to think that religious schools should be exempt from the duty to apply human rights in its schools.Coherent missions and moral socialization through networks that incorporate family, school, and other aspects of life (in this case, churches) are among the hallmarks of Christian schools and may provide direction to public educators who are worried about alienated adolescents and withdrawn families.Having discussed the principles which we see as underlying religious education appropriate to today 's multi-faith society, we now consider how these principles are being put into practice.The religious education is the secular practice of many states to teach of a certain religion with its different aspects - beliefs, rituals, doctrines, rites, customs, and so are particular functions as a person.Therefore, it is imperative that our churches begin a serious effort to educate their members about our history in regard to education in general and public education in particular, and to turn the attention of their denominations to the plight of school children in this country.I am very firm in my views that there is no place for Special Religious Education in our public school system,What is not sufficiently known is that, historically, education, particularly the ability to read the Bible, has also been held to be essential to the development of religious faith.Clearly a major factor in the development of religious education provision has been the availability of specialist teachers of religious education and the extent to which their training has prepared them to adopt a phenomenological approach to their work which acknowledges the religious diversity of Britain today.I appreciate the aim to provide non-discdriminatory, non-privileged education in the area of religion.If they are practising religion in the home, then their church and home based celebrations should more than suffice in their spiritual needs.Preachers should preach at church not school.Perhaps your early conditioning as a Christian will not permit you to see the impossibility of a supernatural being inhabiting a natural universe?public school teachers may not pray with, or in the presence of, their students.Public schools shall be non-sectarian.Although public schools may teach about religious holidays, including their religious aspects, and may celebrate the secular aspects of holidays, schools may not observe holidays as religious events or promote such observance by students.Secularism is about keeping the state and religion separate, the way it should be - not privileging religion of any faith.I was of the opinion that state schools were secular, but this appears to be false.We chose the State system because we prefer that our children have a secular education.I reject the notion the public schools are promoting a religion, or an anti-religion of secular humanism.Schools may indeed and should teach secular values such as honesty, respect for others, courage, kindness and good citizenship.These values, however, must not be taught as religious tenets.Public schools should be strictly secular in my view.Secularism protects people of religion and people of no religion.This is seen in opposition expressed to providing secular ethics in public schools as more school children elect not to attend religious scripture in schools.I visited your webpage recently and totally agree with banning religion from secular schools.A secular school system must avoid giving the impression that its values originate within a particular religious doctrine.That the school realises it is of a secular nature and children expecting a non religious content must not experience any form of discrimination.If it costs $ 5,000 to do a secular education, then $ 2,500 does n't even get you the full cost of a secular education, much less advancing religion.secularism was one of the great constitutional gifts of the English to the world."The system was a failed attempt at removing the  secular '' provision in the education act in order to introduce Christianity for its supposed role in socializing children."""One of the principles this country was founded on was separation of church and state.Public school libraries may include significant religious literature, provided that no one sect 's literature is favored, and the library as a whole does not show any preference for religious works.Alternatives to the present process of opening completely new schools also have to be considered in any future planning.From a research perspective it would be very valuable if information could be collected about children leaving integrated primary schools who go into each of the secondary sectors - integrated, catholic, Protestant, grammar, intermediate and comprehensive.Still, despite their distinct religious missions, the sharp boundary between public schools and private religious schools makes it difficult for us to see the ways in which today 's so-called private schools perform public functions.Instances where a Chaplain or indeed the average untrained mature adult can be of assistance to students in a non-religious manner can not be construed as a template recipe for all or even most situations.If Chaplaincy programs in State Schools were not riddled with such inconsistency and bias advantageously affecting proselytising Christian Fundamentalist evangelism, answers from your department would be straightforward and enlightening.The AFA is deeply disturbed by the existence of the Chaplaincy programs in Queensland and Australian State schools in general as well as the protection afforded it by evasion, denial and obfuscation.What is the controlling mechanism preventing chaplains proselytising their religious point of view in school hours?Is involvement with any religious aspects of the Chaplaincy a mandatory obligation for students?These chaplaincy positions are totally unacceptable in secular schools.Chaplaincy Services in Queensland state schools occur as a community initiative in those schools which identify a need and elect to have the program.Australia was founded as a Christian Nation, not a multicultural one.Australia needs to change to accommodate the multitude of people learning that religion has no part in our community and joining other schools around the world and banning it from be taught.there are many people in Australia who have left religion, and want to raise their children outside of religious teaching,Pupils should be developing the ability to explain how religious believers approach moral issues and dilemmas in the everyday life of individuals and families, and in contemporary society at local, national and international levels.Pupils should be developing the ability to explain the significance of religious history and culture for believers, and the influence which religion has exerted, and continues to exert, on social and cultural life in general, both in this country and throughout the world.Pupils should be developing the ability to describe the main questions about human nature and the human condition, and about the personal identity and purpose in life of individuals, to which religions provide answers or responses.Pupils should be developing the ability to form and express their own views about religious culture and history.Pupils should be developing the ability to explain the claims and insights which religious narratives and stories express for believers.Pupils should be developing the ability to describe the main procedures, customs and ceremonies associated with religious festivals and worship.Pupils should be developing the ability to describe the moral teachings of Christianity and of other great world religions, as outlined in precepts and commandments, and in parables and other stories.it is very important that teachers avoid discussions that seem to endorse religious belief over non-religious belief.Cursory discussions will subtly denigrate the validity of minority religious beliefs held by some individuals, regardless of whether adherents to minority beliefs are represented in the class.Discussion of religion in the classroom may alienate those students who are being raised with no religious faith.Discussion of religion in the classroom may alienate those who are being raised with orthodox religious faiths.Secular schools are an essential ingredient of a secular democracy.Good schools never chain children to belief in the supernatural and the reliance on prayer and divine guidance, because humans must rely on their own resources to deal with problems, not on the codes and superstitions of past ages.In a secular state school, by law, religious education is not compulsory yet the information sheet contains an element of expected attendance.Student participation is voluntary and requires written parent consent to attend. (not decline) Obviously, this is to prevent any accidental religious education which could be seriously offensive to certain other religions and the non-religious.public school is a place of religious neutrality.The constitutional mandate of separation of church and state, as interpreted in a long line of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, prohibits a public school from giving students the impression that it prefers or sanctions a particular religion, or religion generally.It is the state deciding what religious content will be learned, and at what ages, which totally usurps the parents ' authority and role.ADL has received complaints about the promotion of a strongly Christian agenda in a Colorado public charter school.They have been and continue to be both an avenue of opportunity and a major cohesive force in our society -- a society becoming daily more diverse racially, culturally, and religiously.Without full knowledge of our religious and democratic traditions we can not ensure that those elected to school boards are strongly committed to both public education and religious liberty.We call on communities of faith to bring their resources, public concern, and moral authority to support not only the public schools, but also the teachers, the administrators, and, most particularly, the children in those schools.Researchers are beginning to question this simple picture, discerning a healthy diversity among schools that were once portrayed as interchangeable.It has enabled her to widen her cultural context, think about her own beliefs and to really explore diversity.segregation reduces social cohesion, and the earlier in life that happens the worse it is.Where is the evidence to say that government funding, representing our society and our children, is well spent on the current CRE program that teaches creationism as fact and effectively segregates children?Who knew that it could be so hard to not follow the norm and stand up for your right to be an agnostic / atheist?They should not feel guilty about not adhering to a religion.Students may not be compelled to wear gym clothes which, for religious reasons, they consider immodest.where schools permit student expression on the basis of genuinely neutral criteria and students retain primary control over the content of their expression, the speech of students who choose to express themselves through religious means such as prayer is not attributable to the state and therefore may not be restricted because of its religious content.Love for students, for their value as children of God, for their unique gifts, must be the foundation of all we do.Where students or other private graduation speakers are selected on the basis of genuinely neutral, evenhanded criteria and retain primary control over the content of their expression, however, that expression is not attributable to the school and therefore may not be restricted because of its religious (or anti-religious) content."Students do not have the right to force a  captive audience '' to participate in religious exercises."""Students with religious objections to mixed gym classes, but only such students, may be offered sex-segregated gym classes without violating federal law.student prayer clubs are legal so long as these are not conducted during regularly scheduled class time, including study halls.On the final day of RI for 2006 Tuesday the 12th of December Student returned home at the completion of the school day very visibly and emotionally distressed due to an incident during RI in which she describes in great detail the presentation of coloured candy canes by RI Teacher to all students attending the RI class (of which Student is at the very least on visual attendance) at the exclusion of Student.Students are expected to attend the required religion classes held throughout the regular academic year, a Confirmation Retreat, Monthly Youth Rallies, and regular Sunday Masses.there may be coercion between or among students or conflicts between free speech and religious freedom rights.Students must meet the requirements of the program and participate in the celebration of Eucharist each week.When a school chooses not to close on days observed by some students as religious holidays, conflicts between scheduled events and religious holidays will exist.students who attend state schools should not be discriminated against based on their belief or non belief.The school encourages its students to excel academically and taught directed toward an education of Christ-centered life of service.Even though it costs $ 5,000 per person per student, to educate a kid in a public school, they figure that if we transfer even a fraction of that money, half of that money, to a parochial school, somehow we are advancing religion.What happens when a student responds to a secular assignment with religious expression?No student should be made to feel that his or her personal beliefs or practices are being questioned, infringed upon or compromised.You are purposefully failing to give your students a good education just to satisfy your own agenda.A six year old prepatory student at a public state school, starting school forming bonds, relationships and friendships which will form the basis of her school life should not be dealing with segregation and bias based on religious or non-religious preference.I have been a student of Mr. Mullens for five years and not once did i ever hear him say anything about religion.Students who are non-members can attend if parents request in writing that their child opt in.Students are permitted to pray alone or in groups, as long as the activity is not disruptive and does n't infringe on the rights of others.Students wishing exemption because of the religious content in the Anzac Day Parade were obliged to attend.Student religious groups have often requested permission to meet in vacant public school classrooms during school club periods held either before or after school, or, less frequently, during free periods during the school day.Students are allowed to express their beliefs about a religion in homework, artwork and other assignments.To avoid any mistaken perception that a school endorses student speech that is not in fact attributable to the school, school officials may make appropriate, neutral disclaimers to clarify that such speech (whether religious or nonreligious) is the speaker 's and not the schoolTechnology in the high schools includes a variety of tools to assist students with their research, study and presentation of information.Students in the West Shore are also now allowed to wear clothing with religious messages or other personal expressions after a 2010 lawsuit filed by the family of a student who had been asked to turn his anti-abortion T-shirt inside-out.Students can take part in individual and group prayer during the school day.Three years prior to each student 's 13th birthday, the families of students with significant special needs begin to work with Cantor Einhorn to prepare for their Bar/Bat Mitzvah ceremonies.This continued for the duration of the year where Student was removed to the back of the class, seemingly as punishment to a six year old prepatory student for non-attendance of RI.Students are extremely susceptible to peer and public pressure and coercion.Jewish parental involvement appears to be very high and is clearly linked to pupil success:state-sector Jewish schools have slightly smaller class sizes than the national average.All Jewish holidays are celebrated.Nevertheless, information is needed as to likely future trends in the numbers of Jewish children, according to variables such as age, cohort, gender, geographical location and religious affiliation.To me the key seems to be in knowing and understanding Jewish traditions so they can help propel us forward in our own lives and in the realm of Jewish thinking itself.Today Jewish schools are flourishing.For Jewish day school education to meet future needs, wants and requirements of government, sponsors, community leaders, parents and pupils, a constant awareness of current and potential challenges, informed by suitable research, is required.Finally, education in Jewish day schools is still primarily delivered in a classical manner, in particular places at particular times.As methods of ' Jewishly ' educating children, day schools are necessarily an expensive option, requiring the teaching of not just Judaic studies but secular subjects as well.At that point we were not actively looking for the Jewish aspects of the school, but once we found ourselves there we became delighted with the Jewish cultural values and community.The growth in the number of Jewish day schools since 1950 was a response by communal leaders in the United Kingdom to expressed concerns about a ' crisis ' in Jewish education.Some Jewish parents also noted difficulties in obtaining the information needed for making educational choices for their children.Jewish practices, such as the wearing of kippot, are generally encouraged but are not obligatory.According to government criteria, Jewish schools -- as an example of faith-based education -- can be judged successful only if they achieve both good academic results and pupils leave the institutions well adjusted, tolerant and able to contribute ' positively ' to British society.The purpose of this report has been to raise these issues as a basis for communal debate on the future directions of Jewish day schooling.Historically, Judaic subjects have been staffed on a different basis to secular studies, with Jewish studies and Hebrew teachers being supernumerary, with salaries paid for out of parental contributions and grants from charitable foundations.There are currently four specialist Jewish schools for children with special educational needs.While a unified curriculum among Jewish day schools may be impractical given the very different religious affiliations and backgrounds of parents and pupils, this does not rule out the possibility of groups of similar-ethos schools combining to create and then assess shared curricula.Rather than focusing on the practice of religion, the emphasis is on Jewish values and culture.Alongside the largely social and cultural Jewish factors discussed above, a number of interviewees argued that it was specifically the religious component of the school ethos that attracted them to that particular institution.it is more accurately conceptualized as a series of interconnected Jewish day school systems that do not overlap in terms of provisionFor some parents, it was the social and cultural, rather than the specifically religious, side of Jewish schools that was of most importance.The Jewish community has specialist services for assisting parents that provide facilities in tune with individuals ' cultural and religious requirements.They get the opportunity to learn about Judaism while still practicing their own religion.pupils at Jewish day schools achieve examination scores that are considerably higher than the national average,"No Jewish family in Australia is any danger of not having access to  their community '' families do not want, or need, religious instructors trespassing on them via the authority of their school principal."""Another parent described Jewish day school education as giving her child ' a strong sense of identityIn the event of any dispute as to whether a child is Jewish, the authority of the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Commonwealth is finalFrom interviews with headteachers, SEN professionals and parents of children with special needs, four specifically Jewish areas of concern emerged.The broader aims of the report involve an analysis of the system (or systems) of Jewish day school education, including a discussion of Jewish day schools in relation to wider national concerns about the role of faith-based education.Particular traditional Jewish practices, such as the ' rites of passage ' that Jewish males aged 13 and females aged 12 go through during bar mitzvah, bat mitzvah or bat chayil ceremonies, may also contribute to the success of Jewish day school pupils, particularly in English.total number of Jewish schools (both state-sector voluntary-aided and independent) rose from 23 in 1954, 57 in 1975, 70 in 1989, to 135 in 1999.The strictly Orthodox education system is anything but homogeneous and includes a range of schools: state-sector and independent, high general academic achievers and schools in which little or no time is spent on general curriculum subjects and which are on the very edge of the national UK education system.Orthodox schools are more likely to integrate MLD childrenthe independent strictly Orthodox sector faces serious problems in providing for children with special needs.Strictly Orthodox state-sector schools face similar problems to ' mainstream ' institutions in terms of recruiting qualified general staff.Strictly Orthodox schools also suffer problems in recruiting suitably qualified senior managers and headteachers.If the number of strictly Orthodox pupils continues to grow as quickly as it has been, this part of the Jewish community will need to ascertain how it can ensure educational standards within suitable and safe accommodation.These figures suggest that, while pupils in state-sector Jewish schools do well compared to the national state average, they do not perform up to the levels of the top private schools.Many strictly Orthodox schools, and especially those catering for boys, currently view this as an unacceptable alteration to their ethos.a key policy question for strictly Orthodox schools is whether or not to seek voluntary-aided status and move into the state sector.Moreover, a number of strictly Orthodox schools do not enter their pupils for public examinations because of a heavy prioritization of Judaic teaching over secular, general curriculum studies.The good thing about our school is that it incorporates the Jewish education for the children at a very early age, which helps us as parents when they 're growing upChildren are taught according to a traditional Orthodox ethos, which varies according to the values and backgrounds of pupils ' families.The ethos of Jewish day schools, which are predominantly Orthodox in character, does not match the aims and wishes of a large percentage of parents.In any case, many of these schools were associated with the strictly Orthodox community and might not have met Local Education Authority (LEA) standards.The admissions criteria of such schools will, however, give priority to Jewish children over those who are non-Jewish.A nice testimonial to the school 's appeal/success is that non-Jews attend because it is a very special place.Jewish thought runs through the school, but you need not be Jewish to attend.Accordingly, one headteacher argued that, while academic results were a major draw at her Jewish school, the other principal attraction was that children would be educated within a Jewish social environment:Torah stories are discussed with the acknowledgement that some people think they happened exactly as written, while others think they are myths and legends.There is great diversity at Tehiyah in terms of Jewish observance, beliefs, political views.I like the way that Jewish culture is transmitted as it truly gives something significant to the children.He argued that the shortfall in Jewish studies teachers was due to low pay, societal perceptions of teaching and a lack of training:The ethos of schools is also one of the prime factors used by Jewish parents to choose between different institutionsTraditionally, education has been at the top of the Jewish communal agenda.While many of the strictly Orthodox Jewish day schools do not enter pupils for public examination, the success of those Jewish day school pupils that do is doubtless due to a combination of factors, including socio-economic background, the commitment, expectations and values of parents and pupils, and school ethos.Zionism is not generally an aspect in these schools.Key to this debate is the quality of Jewish services compared with alternative provision, and the ' added values ' of providing education to children in a specifically Jewish environment.These schools will only accept children whose mothers were born Jewish or else who converted under the auspices of Orthodox authorities.Jewish traditions are taught and presented as a starting point, not an end point.These schools closed early on winter Friday afternoons and even taught classes on religious Jewish education.a shortage of Jewish teachers is still a matter of concern.only 7 per cent of ' secular ' parents send their children to Jewish day schools, and indeed half of all Jewish day school pupils are from non-Sabbath-observant homes.Jewish day schools are also likely to become much more communal in the future in terms of the services they offer.To get Jewish studies staff was a constant headache, not just for us, but for all the Jewish schools.The ethos of the school is based unambiguously on the principles of Orthodox Judaism.The strength of teaching in state-sector Jewish day schools is not demonstrated right across the board, with OFSTED inspectors commending the teaching of some subjects as strong, but criticizing others as weak.The school policy shows preference to pupils whose mothers were born Jewish and claim this is a religious issue not based on race.The Jewish community needs to consider the balance between achieving academic standards and providing services to children with special educational needs.because of the tremendous range of Jewish identities and beliefs, the children learn very quickly what true tolerance means.Jewish studies teachers did n't have qualifications so they do n't go further, there was a glass ceiling.There are many interfaith couples, and while the children get the Jewish culture, it is pretty secular.There are non-Jewish and interfaith families at Tehiyah who are completely comfortable, there, as well.While the number of Jewish day schools has grown rapidly over the past half-century, and pupils in these schools are largely achieving good academic examination results compared to the national average, a series of key strategic issues still face the overall Jewish schooling sector.Catholic schools were also the first schools to desegregate.Catholic schools actually teach about tolerance and evolution.they do n't see the problems the VEC model faces because they seem happy with the way Catholic primary schools have been dealing with the influx of children from other faiths.It was also clear that our traditional, largely Catholic primary school system needed urgent reform.More than 95 per cent of primary school children attend catholic schools.At present many of those parents send their children to catholic schools and have attached their identity to those schools, admire the work of the teachers, the principals and the boards of management of those skills.There was also a feeling that it was very important that staunch Protestants and Roman Catholics were choosing to send their children to the schools.I attended catholic school where I learned about evolution within the science curriculum.The Catholic school 's not just interested in teaching religion, but they have had a mission to serve more children.If you are lucky enough to be part of the Catholic community in your class, you get to stay there during religion time.It is always painful to see Catholics fulminate about life in a secular society.I chose non-scripture for my son so, for 40 mins, while his mates are discovering the ' joys of catholicism ' or other christian teachings, he has to sit and play with toys, totally unstimulated."That a teacher told India to  keep quiet because you 'll get in trouble '' after she wrote a paper about religious freedom."""Victoria could lead the way for other parts of Australia by developing a much more inclusive, critically focused approach to education about religions and beliefs.Victorian law says schools are powerless to stop an accredited religious instructor holding classes during the school day.Victoria 's system, is failing to serve the interests of children and religions, because it presents children religious instruction divorced from the diverse traditions and practices of the many religious communities amongst us.The Cathedral Religious Education program is designed to help your child grow spiritually at their individual level of experience and comprehension.Pressures for religious particularity-such as teaching students the Baptist doctrine that only adult believers should be baptized-are nearly always checked by the need to attract more students.Support from the Religious Education office that enables parents to prepare their child for the reception of the Sacraments.In most primary schools religious education takes place within the time devoted to storytelling and the time set aside for specific projects.It had therefore become fairly common practice to depute the subject to any teacher willing to teach it and who had some knowledge of the Bible.Parents are thus, often reluctantly, drawn into a situation of conflict between the requirements of their faith and the rules of the school.I support the teaching of other religions, but not by taking away a culture that has been happening in our school system since the first school was established.The debate over the extent to which the schools should be ' Christian ' in their ethos and how this should affect the attitude to the participation of teachers, parents and children of other religious backgrounds or none is related to this and is producing a range of strong opinions.Some argued that the children will ' miss out ' if there is no or little religious content in the end of year concert."When some parents ask about the provision of classes in moral education instead of religious education, they are told that  moral values can not be divorced from a religious setting"""Why on an earth should a faith school provide a relatively better structured environment?I can not accept that you can have both - the government advances educational apartheid while claiming that the educational framework promotes social cohesion while the selection process does not!The non theistic arguments just got a better hearing then they normally would and perhaps people in this climate feel more confident about raising their concerns about faith.Although many of the member denominations of the National Council of the Churches of Christ have issued statements supportive of public education, and although the NCC itself has made its pro-public schools stance clear for several decades, in recent years the voices of our churches have been largely absent from the ongoing debate about the meaning and future of our nation s schools.We acknowledge the debate among the members of our churches over whether public funds might appropriately be used to remedy the lingering effects of racial injustice in our nation s educational system.With this statement we propose to bring the voices of our member churches back into the present debate, bringing with us our traditional support for the strengthening and reform of the public schools.Nothing in this Part shall be read or given effect in a way which prohibits or restricts discussion, criticism or expressions of antipathy, dislike, ridicule, insult or abuse of particular religions or the beliefs or practices of their adherents, or of any other belief system or the beliefs or practices of its adherents, or proselytising or urging adherents of a different religion or belief system to cease practising their religion or belief system.We also caution that government aid to primary and secondary religious schools raises constitutional problems, and could undermine the schools ' independence and/or compromise their religious message.There is no inherent conflict between faith and science, and religious faith has nothing to fear from programs which encourage children to read and to imagine, or to see math and science as ways to understand the many wonders of God s world;Therefore, the churches of the National Council of the Churches of Christ state with renewed conviction their belief that public education should have the full and conscientious support of Christians and Christian churches.The Churches have a long history of providing education in this country and have confirmed their commitment to community cohesion.Faith schools have an excellent record in providing high-quality education and serving disadvantaged communities and are some of the most ethnically and socially diverse in the country.In contrast, some of the parents who had strong social and political views were not sympathetic to a very clear Christian emphasis within the schools.Some were Christian but others were agnostic or atheist, and they expressed concern that the schools could become too closely identified with Christianity.My major concern has to do with the limited opportunities the kids are afforded to meet kids of other backgrounds.There is no inherent conflict between faith and science, and religious faith has nothing to fear from programs which encourage children to read and to imagine, or to see math and science as ways to understand the many wonders of God 's world;Moreover, the lack of a shared curriculum means that there is no comparative framework for assessing the strengths and weaknesses of Judaic teaching across the range of Jewish day schools.Follow an objective, fair and balanced comparative syllabus for education about religions and beliefsFounded on strong liberal arts traditions, supported by the technology of today and focused on the needs of tomorrow, the Catholic high school curriculum is designed to prepare students for

advertising and the increasing rates of obesity among youth.While the positive correlation between the hours of television viewed, body mass index, and obesity incidence has been documented, the exact mechanisms through which this occurs are still being investigated.Fast food outlets spend $ 3 billion in television ads targeted to children.The Department of Health is partnering with the TV children

weight gain from birth.obese parents have obese kids, and active parents have active kids.Overweight parents - a family 's eating patterns can have a major influence on whether a child maintains a healthy weight.Parents who are obese are more likely (28 percent) than those of normal weight (16 percent) to report having children who are overweight.Children who have overweight parents are more likely to be overweight themselves.Studies indicate that genetic factors determine up to 75 % of our body weight.This observation suggests that individuals can inherit certain genes that make them susceptible for weight gain.If obesity runs in the family, it greatly influences parents ' and grandparents ' ideas about the causes and cures for it and can produce feelings of guilt, shame, or vulnerability.Research shows a strong correlation between a child 's size (height, weight, and BMI) and the ecological factors present in the family 's environment.Children are getting more of their
