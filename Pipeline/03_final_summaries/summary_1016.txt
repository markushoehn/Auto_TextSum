Summary of document file topic_1016.xml

Narcolepsy is a rare chronic neurologic disorder that presents with daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotional arousal such as laughter), hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.
Children who do not sleep well may have a sleep problem.
Children can have just one type of problem or can have a mixture of problems.
Psychiatric issues frequently associated with ASD such as anxiety and/or depression can interfere with sleep.
Parents must be particularly sensitive to the fact that they must attend to both providing nurturing and to encouraging independence.
