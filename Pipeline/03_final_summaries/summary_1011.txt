recognising that parents who choose to homeschool are committed to their children's education
Homeschooling LD and ADHD children is not as hard as helping them with their homework.
Educating your children at home is likely another part of your planned-out, self-sufficient family life.
Immunizations can be done at your family doctor's office or your local health unit.
Homeschooling is not much of an improvement over the regular classroom if there is no attempt to customize the curriculum to fit each student's individual talents, interests, limitations, and needs.
