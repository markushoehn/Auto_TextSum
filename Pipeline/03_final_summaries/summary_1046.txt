Encourage your child to be responsible and work independently.
Parents need to be on the same page with the school.
Some schools, for example, set policies of "zero tolerance" for gang-related clothing or activities.
Active learning also can take place when your child plays sports, spends time with friends, acts in a school play, plays a musical instrument or visits museums and bookstores.
Hunger, abuse, violence, family instability, substance abuse and neglect are very real barriers to learning that schools alone cannot surmount.
