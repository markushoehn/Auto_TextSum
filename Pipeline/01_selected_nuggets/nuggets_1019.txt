1019/62/1917	Students will be expected to participate in the presentation of the lecture material.
1019/62/1913	The students will also be exposed to the specific applied research groups within the Department, their techniques, and their specific application of the scientific method.
1019/66/1981	Most adverse effects of grafting techniques are temporary and can be easily prevented or treated.
1019/27/813	Students will apply their methodological understanding by spending the second half of the semester conducting a pilot-study aligned with their interests in instructional technology.
1019/50/1592	Teaching an Essential Habit of Mind: Reading Like Writers in the Context of Illustration Study
1019/47/1490	Emission reduction techniques alter fire behavior and fire effects and can impair or prevent accomplishment of land management objectives.
1019/51/1609	The particular methods required will be determined by the objectives of the study and these must be clearly defined at the outset.
1019/51/1662	A key requirement of these techniques is that the capture and marking does not harm the animal or alter the behaviour.
1019/74/2069	Physiotherapy is an essential part of the recovery process following bone or soft tissue injuries
1019/42/1373	It is encouraging that students are using more advanced statistical techniques and that more mixed methods studies are planned.
1019/8/275	Collective case: Multiple cases (either individuals or organizations) are used to explore an issue.
1019/10/441	Many methods instrument the given product by adding debugging or testing code in such a way that features of the product can be demonstrated and evaluated when the product is executed.
1019/8/295	The main benefit of case study research is the depth of information provided about a single unit (person, organization, or issue) within context.
1019/51/1671	Removal trapping is essential in this case because electric fishing is of variable efficiency and never 100% efficient.
1019/1/35	Exemplary case study design ensures that the procedures used are well documented and can be repeated with the same results over and over again.
1019/58/1887	Simulations are an ideal method for evaluating the performance of alternative estimators because the methods can be applied to populations of known size.
1019/51/1687	Sonar survey methods are widely used to study fish distribution and the most sophisticated systems are able to estimate the number of fish in rivers or lakes.
1019/15/561	Students can find a location near them that offers the course in an interactive classroom setting, or they may use the convenience of the Internet to study in the privacy of their own homes.
1019/51/1618	Care is required at all stages to ensure that the study is realistic given the manpower and other resources available.
1019/31/1098	Social, emotional, and intellectual factors relevant to topics such as readiness, motivation, discipline, and evaluation in the classroom.
1019/55/1791	Increasingly, transportation studies are concerned with impacts and public policy issues .
1019/51/1613	Intensive studies involve the repeated observation of a population to gain insight into demographic processes.
1019/51/1698	Ecologists frequently seek to identify processes that result in density-dependent births and deaths.
1019/1/55	Maintaining the relationship between the issue and the evidence is mandatory.
1019/58/1852	If the proportion of the population that is observable does not vary among surveys, the DO method can be used to monitor trends.
1019/21/674	Warning: THE METHOD will not convert a student with little or no math or writing ability into one that excels in these abilities.
1019/31/1070	Students who earn this certificate develop a framework for studying issues in public policy and education policy, examine how education policy is developed and implemented, and learn methods for evaluating programs and policies.
1019/41/1324	Students use mathematics to design interesting graphical forms and also create mathematical challenges to share with others.
1019/55/1793	Various types of impacts are considered, including economic (e.g. community development), social (e.g. access to services), environmental (e.g. air or water pollution) and health (e.g. road accidents).
1019/48/1521	High levels of heterotrophic bacteria typically found in natural surface waters may amplify this masking effect.
