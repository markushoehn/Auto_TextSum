====================== General Summary of 1033 ======================
Children perform better at school when their parents are involved in their education.
Students with parents who are involved in their school tend to have fewer behavioral problems and better academic performance, and are more likely to complete high school than students whose parents are not involved in their school.
Kids who know that their parents are involved and interested tend to take more responsibility for their own learning and behavior.
Parents should encourage their children to stay in touch with counselors too.
