====================== General Summary of 1028 ======================
Children may feel as if they are "walking on eggshells" and are unaware that alcohol or other drugs influence their parents' moods.
Children are at great risk for emotional, sexual, and physical abuse by parents or guardians who use alcohol or other substances.
Parent training, drug/alcohol evaluations, drug/alcohol outpatient treatment, and intensive family counseling are also common.
Parents who abuse alcohol place their children at increased risk for alcohol and other drug use as well as for psychological problems.
