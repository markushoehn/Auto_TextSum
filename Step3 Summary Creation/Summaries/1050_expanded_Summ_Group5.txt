Children can pick up negative attitudes and if a child thinks the parent disapproves of or doesn't respect a teacher, the child will think such an attitude is acceptable, which will just make any existing problems worse and more difficult to resolve.The parents are certain that their child is gifted and that is the cause of the problems.Parents of immigrant children may distrust any "special" classes, including classes for gifted and talented (Wei, 1983).Parents of gifted children are typically the single most important influence in their childs development, outlook, and fulfillment of talent.
