====================== General Summary of 1008 ======================
Keeping in regular contact with both parents can help your children deal with the fears, fantasies, and emotional upset caused by the separation.
Communication needs to be by and through the parents, with the aid of a neutral professional when required.
The stress can adversely affect the custodial parent's ability to function effectively; it can serve to inhibit the non-custodial parent from remaining involved in the child's life; and it may affect how the child adjusts to family disruption and turmoil.
Encourage your children to describe how they feel when conflicts arise.
