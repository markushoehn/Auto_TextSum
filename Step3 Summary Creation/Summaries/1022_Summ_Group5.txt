====================== General Summary of 1022 ======================
Many kids feel ashamed, or even believe what bullies tell them.
Kids who experience severe or long-term bullying may develop ongoing self-esteem and confidence issues, and may have a hard time making or keeping friends.
Victims of cyberbullying may experience many of the same effects as children who are bullied in person, such as a drop in grades, low self-esteem, a change in interests, or depression.
Children who are bullied often develop low self-esteem and can develop problems at school and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide.
