====================== General Summary of 1010 ======================
"The Court has opined that the only role of parents is to help their children in the education they receive in the institutional schools."
Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.
Public education within the United States is a matter which our constitutional system leaves to the discretion of each State.
Military families, therefore, have no obligation to seek approval of the DoD to homeschool.
