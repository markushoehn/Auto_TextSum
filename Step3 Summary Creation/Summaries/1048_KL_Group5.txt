====================== General Summary of 1048 ======================
Toilet training will be easier on you and your child if your child is both physically and emotionally ready to begin toilet training.
Toilet training an older child is not just about productive conversation, determined self-mastery, and an eager desire to conform to big-kid behavior.
Your child will be encouraged to use crayons, paint brushes and finger paints.
DO keep an eye on your child: It is your responsibility as a parent/caregiver to watch for dangerous play, not sharing and hitting.
