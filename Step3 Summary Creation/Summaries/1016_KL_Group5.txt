====================== General Summary of 1016 ======================
Children with sleep terrors will often also talk in their sleep or sleepwalk.
Behavioral insomnia results in delayed sleep onset, fragmented nocturnal sleep, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness.
Sleep associations are everything your child associates with falling to sleep and are often the key to understanding your child's sleep problem.
Parents must be particularly sensitive to the fact that they must attend to both providing nurturing and to encouraging independence.
