====================== General Summary of 1015 ======================
Parents and children bond as teacher and students in a way that non-homeschooling families just cannot understand.
Homeschooling parents should not need to prove they are innocent of abusing their children as a condition for freely exercising their parental rights in education.
Parents homeschooling their children are able to speed up or slow down schoolwork, unconstrained with governmentally-approved curriculums or work having to be handed in at a certain time (Colfax 48).
Homeschooling is an educational option in which the parents assume the responsibility for educating their children at home.
