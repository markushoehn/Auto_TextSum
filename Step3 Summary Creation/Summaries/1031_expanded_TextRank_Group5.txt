Parents have to make sure their kids are committed to their online home school programs, which can be a daunting task considering that they do not have fixed standards of discipline to follow.
The central tenants of positive discipline is that all children want "to belong" to their community, misbehavior is the result of a mistaken goal about how "to belong", and that discipline teaches.
Research has shown too that punishment that is unconnected to the misbehavior teaches some to avoid the behavior and many others to sneak, cheat and hide to avoid punishment.
