====================== General Summary of 1017 ======================
Federal student loans are not based on credit, but on the borrower desire to receive financial aid.
Federal student loans are a desirable form of financial aid, as they have lower interest rates than many private student loans, and in some cases can be subsidized, meaning the government pays interest on the loan while the borrower is in school.
Federal financial aid is offered to all students in need irrespective of their area of specialization, and federal loans have lower interest rates and more flexible repayment terms than do private student loans for nursing students or otherwise.
