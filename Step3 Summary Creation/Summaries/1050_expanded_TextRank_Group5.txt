====================== General Summary of 1050 ======================
Children can pick up negative attitudes and if a child thinks the parent disapproves of or doesn't respect a teacher, the child will think such an attitude is acceptable, which will just make any existing problems worse and more difficult to resolve.
Parents are a child's first teachers, and they are most familiar with their child's personal characteristics, especially with the development of interests that can be linked to special talents.
The parents are certain that their child is gifted and that is the cause of the problems.
Teach your child to respect the work of others.
