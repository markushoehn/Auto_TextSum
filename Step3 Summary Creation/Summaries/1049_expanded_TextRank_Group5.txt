====================== General Summary of 1049 ======================
Many parents, when they choose their first preschool or send their child to first grade, are unaware of the underlying values or the long-term implications of the educational system they have chosen.
Members are never requested, directly or indirectly, to locate in a geographic area or to limit or restrict their contacts with any family members or friends outside the "movement."
Students remain with the same teacher from first grade through eighth.
Teachers must also satisfy whatever state credential and licensing requirements might apply.
