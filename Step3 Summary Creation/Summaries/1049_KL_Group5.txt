====================== General Summary of 1049 ======================
Many parents, when they choose their first preschool or send their child to first grade, are unaware of the underlying values or the long-term implications of the educational system they have chosen.
Parents can provide nothing of more lasting value than an education which develops their child's full human potential.
Parents are encouraged to communicate regularly with their child's teacher, not only during Parent-Teacher conferences but anytime they have questions or concerns.
Members are never requested or required to reliquish any memberships or associations with any other religious, political or social organizations.
