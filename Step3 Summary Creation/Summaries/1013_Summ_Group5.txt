Some schools offer parent/infant classes, in which parents learn to observe their child and meet his needs in the Montessori way.
A Montessori is a learning shelter for the kids or children who are taught various activities in the class and its relation in real life.
Parents considering placing a child in a Montessori school should ask about the school's accreditations and affiliations.
The children who attended the Montessori school, and the children who did not, were tested for their cognitive and academic skills, and for their social and behavioral skills.
