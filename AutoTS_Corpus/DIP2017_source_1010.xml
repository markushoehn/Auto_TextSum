Join Mike Farris and Representative Pete Hoekstra(MI), the sponsor of H.J. Res 42, for a briefing on the resolution and the effort to pass the Parental Rights Amendment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">On July 7th, 2009, the Marshall County Tribune-Courier reported that the Director of Pupil Personnel (DPP) for Marshall County Public Schools intended to do random home visits of all of the homeschool programs in the county over the next few months. HSLDA has written to Ms. Williamson and explained that this would be contrary to the Best Practices Document and potentially in violation of a family's privacy rights. Staff Attorney Thomas J. (Tj) Schmidt will host a discussion of this situation and provide general information to members on what to do in the event Ms. Williamson's stated plan goes forward. While it's natural to feel apprehensive about contact from the public school, being prepared with the right tools can enable you to answer any knock at your door with confidence. Know your rights and how to respond. Come join HSLDA's Attorney Dewitt Black as he explains the options available to parents for conducting home education in Pennsylvania and covers the legal problems most often encountered between families and public school officials. He will also discuss the current legislative proposal to change the state's homeschool law, which would require superintendents to accept the findings of the evaluator chosen by the parent and prevent the superintendent from conducting another independent review of the portfolio.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">Are you wondering what you need to do to comply with Minnesota homeschool law?

Come listen to HSLDA Attorney Mike Donnelly and Christian Home Educators of New Hampshire President Jim Parison talk about homeschooling in the Granite State during these uncertain times. Homeschooling in California may soon get the chance to prove that private homeschooling is their legal right. Pressures now are more intense than I've seen in my ten years of close attention to the California legal scene. A SARB member told the families, "It is illegal to teach your child at home unless you have a teaching credential." The legal requirements for operating a private school are few: File an affidavit (an "R-4") with the State, disclosing a small amount of mainly demographic information.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">But while there is no statutory restriction that would prevent a parent from establishing a legal private school and then enrolling his/her own children in that school, the California education establishment wishes otherwise. Annette Hall, a homeschooler who has made this case her personal cause, is working to rally support for Patricia, Hans, and Nils, including fundraising for the mounting legal fees and psychologists' fees. I met him at a SARB hearing in early 1997, when, in my role as Legal Chair of the California Homeschool Network, I was, helping a family named Klaes. I had helped them obtain legal representation from the U. S. Justice Foundation. Grey Matters: Mounting Challenges to Homeschooling Rights in California Now it appears that the question may be settled in court. Their ordeals pave the way for the freedom of thousands of California homeschooling families</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">Alameda County has worked hard in the last decade to earn the distinction of being California's most hostile county for homeschoolers. They have the potential to end long-standing climate of homeschooling freedom for all California homeschoolers. The events in Alameda affect all homeschoolers in California, and ultimately, all liberty-loving parents everywhere. Any loss of family freedom anywhere is unacceptable to independent homeschoolers. Case #1: The Berkeley Four After fifteen months of harassment, four families in Berkeley Unified School District (BUSD) have been referred to the District Attorney for alleged truancy violations. All four families have met compliance with compulsory attendance law, through the establishment of a private school or by enrolling their children in a private independent study school. Now the parents of these families face the possibility of prosecution.</paragraph><paragraph parID="28">If the District Attorney prefers charges, the six children involved in the case will be marched through Juvenile Court to determine whether they are "habitual truants." Once a determination is made regarding the children, then their parents may be prosecuted for violation for compulsory attendance law and "willfully fail[ing] to respond to directives of " the SARB. Rogers is himself a homeschooling father. In a letter to the SARB, Rogers wrote, "Th[e] fundamental right of a parent to direct the education of his or her child includes the right to refuse institutionalized education, and instead, to employ the parent's own resources, in the privacy of the home and the chosen community, toward that vital and primary duty which is the education of his or her own child." According to Berkeley schools' spokesperson Karen Sarlo, the ex-husband of one of the homeschooling mothers complained to the district. Whenever a car stops in front of their house, they're thinking it's CPS or the sheriff, but they are resolute in their determination to exercise their fundamental right to homeschool." A short course in California homeschool law The California Education Code provides two exceptions to compulsory school attendance: 1.</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">Tutorial instruction by a credentialed teacher; and 2. Enrollment in a private school, including independent study programs. Homeschoolers in California have long relied on the second option, private school enrollment. Homeschool parents establish their own private schools by meeting all the requirements pertaining to private schools. Some parents enroll their children in a private school that sponsors independent study. Maintain attendance records. Teach (or offer to teach) from a list of required subjects.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">Teach in English. Instruction must be given by persons who are "capable of teaching" (no mention of credentials!) The Code does not specify the size of the school, the possibility of familial relationships between the administrator and the students, or the location of the school. State Department of Education directives tell school districts "If a parent chooses to teach his or her child at home and does not hold a teaching credential, the child is truant from public school. The appropriate school district is authorized to take truancy action and the parent is subject to an infraction fine." There are two faulty old case law decisions (People v. Turner, 1953 and In Re: Shinn 1961) that get trotted out as "proof" of the State's claim. SARBs occasionally act upon the State's urging, attempting to bring truancy charges against homeschools which are private schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">Homeschoolers protest that the SARB is a mechanism designed to deal with truancy of only public school students, having no legitimate authority over private schools and the students enrolled in them. Case # 2: Berkeley resident Patricia Moodian-Pink A single homeschooling mother, Patricia Moodian-Pink, also a Berkeley resident, was stunned when Child Protective Service (CPS) workers with police escorts came to her door to "check on the children." The reason given: "homeschool isolation." The CPS documents state, "The children are home schooled and never see anyone but their mother." Homeschoolers and many others in the area immediately rushed to protest. To all appearances, they have used CPS to arrange the twins removal from their mother on a trumped up charge of "homeschool isolation." Case #3: Homeschooler arrested; another family threatened San Leandro Unified School District is harassing homeschoolers again.</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">We thought we had the matter resolved so that the family could get on with homeschooling. The article states, "Burgess said Klaes once had a permit for home study --as the law requires &#151; but didn't meet the requirements of home schooling. She had to use an attorney to get the home-schooling approved in the first place." California Homeschool Network, Christian Home Educators Association and Homeschool Association of California all attempted to locate the Klaes family and offer assistance. Since that deeply concerning incident, San Leandro Unified has selected yet another homeschooling family and begun making illegal demands. Rather they are coming on the letterhead of a large, pricey law firm that San Leandro Unified District has apparently hired for the purposes of pursuing homeschoolers. Some homeschoolers are saying that these situations do not have to be taken seriously because "they are custody cases, not homeschooling cases."</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">The entangling of custody battles and government actions against the freedom to homeschool is a despicable development. The point of a test case would not be the of end homeschooling&#151;it would aim for the complete control of homeschooling. Private school students are a fiscal loss to the schools. Berkeley Unified School District wants every penny of their state ADA allotment;$4,606 per student is expected for the 99-00 school year. The six children of the Berkeley Four therefore amount to $27,636 in lost income to the district. Their intimidation over the years has managed to cull independent homeschoolers down to smaller and smaller numbers, while they dangle public school independent study programs (ISP) with lots of goodies in front of the homeschooling community. The current actions against homeschoolers may be the final effort to slam the door shut on private homeschooling, leaving California homeschoolers no alternative but public school programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">This would be a catastrophic loss of freedom, even to families who are currently enrolled in public ISPs. If education establishment obtains monopoly control over homeschoolers, there will be no incentive to please homeschoolers. If the Berkeley Four becomes a test case, we can take comfort in the knowledge that they have a strong case in their favor. Attorney Rogers is well prepared to defend his clients on statutory grounds and Constitutional grounds. Nevertheless, much depends on the attitude of the judge who hears the case and his/her willingness to rely on the precedents set by Turner and In re: Shinn. Speaking of precedents, there are two possible precedents here. Let's call them Capital P-Precedent and small p-precedent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">Capital P-Precedent would occur if the Berkeley Four case reaches the appellate level; then the outcome of the case would be legally binding on all California homeschoolers. In effect, the judiciary's interpretation of the Education Code in this matter would become the law of the land. Small p-precedent is already taking effect. The very existence of these three cases is a danger to homeschoolers around California. School administrators may already be modeling their truancy control program for next year after Bob Burgess's arrest squad. Other districts may already be setting up new guidelines for their SARBs. CPS workers may be waiting to hear the outcome of Patricia Moodian-Pink's case.</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">The Robinson truancy prosecution in San Mateo County stimulated hostile contacts against homeschoolers all over California. Such a victory, even in the lower courts, will set a small-p precedent for school districts around the state. Their hopes of ever stopping private homeschooling by litigation would be effectively dashed, leaving them only one other way to stop it: new legislation. A homeschooling legal victory could ironically lead to a legislative defeat. The California Homeschool Network (CHN) is working closely with attorney Will Rogers to direct a stream of protest against the Berkeley Unified School District. This list is an opportunity for homeschoolers involved in custody issues to contact other homeschoolers for information about homeschooling attorneys and experts, as well as exchange ideas and information about handling custody disputes as a result of homeschooling.

C., metropolitan area and have already established many contacts to assist us in the function of a 'watch dog' for homeschooling in our nation's capital, but we see a need to expand these services." In a letter to California Congressman William E. Dannemeyer, dated October 26, 1990, Farris wrote, "Home School Legal Defense Association officially represents 18,500 families from all fifty states who are homeschooling their children; this figure represents approximately 50,000 children. Through our subsidiary, The National Center for Home Education, we also work cooperatively with state homeschooling organizations in every state who represent the bulk of all homeschooling families."</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">This type of brazen misrepresentation has prompted homeschoolers in state after state to protest the actions of HSLDA/NCHE. In our Nov/Dec, 1990 issue a homeschooling mother wrote, "I joined HSLDA for legal protection only. I did not ask to join NCHE. I do not want to be part of a discriminatory organization and I do not want them to claim they represent my views." And in our May/June, 1990 issue we published an Open Letter to The National Center for Home Education from two homeschooling leaders in Pennsylvania, Diana Baseman and Claire Whitmire, in which they questioned "the presumed representation of all homeschoolers." They told HSLDA and NCHE that "Because you have failed to distinguish or define your constituency, you have wrongly presumed the interest and support of us all and denied individuals the freedom not to be a part of your organization." The most blatant slap in the face of our freedoms appeared in an article that was first published in HSLDA's Home School Court Report and later reprinted in The Teaching Home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">Farris wrote,"Who gets to speak for the homeschooling movement? The majority speaks for the movement. Why should it rattle anyone's cage for the majority of homeschoolers to define the position of the movement? I would hope that non-Christian homeschoolers would endorse the rights of Christian homeschoolers -- including the right to vote our convictions and the right to majority rule." This seemingly clever argument conceals a couple of important points. It would be extremely presumptuous of anyone to represent all the convictions of every Christian. And it would be even more foolish to argue for majority rule.</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">Given the attitude toward homeschooling in America today, the right to majority rule would result in all of our children being put back into public schools. To maintain our freedoms, each and every one of us has to be able to define our own positions, assume our own responsibilities, and make our own decisions based on our personal beliefs. We can accept no less. HSLDA: Legal and Legislative Experts? Since 1983, Home School Legal Defense Association has worked hard to position itself atop the exclusive hierarchy as the preeminent legal and legislative organization for all homeschoolers. Their impact on our freedoms has become one of our primary concerns. As presumed legal and legislative experts, they impose themselves on state networks and assume the individuals' responsibility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">When this happens, people on the state and local level are no longer building long-term relationships they can use, they are building relationships for HSLDA. When out-of-state attorneys fly in and start pulling tricks out of their hats they effectively circumvent the kind of networking and coalition building that can best serve the real needs of homeschooling families. In addition, when HSLDA acts as the outside expert, they give themselves the highest level of visibility and assume primary decision-making roles. Too often, state homeschool leaders have been razzle-dazzled by HSLDA's legalistic maneuverings, which makes homeschoolers more likely to turn to HSLDA for help with problems in the future, rather than trying to work things out on their own. This dependency inevitably leads to compromising the interests of those who either don't see a need for HSLDA protection, don't meet the membership requirements, or who would just rather assume their own responsibilities. Further, HSLDA's trend towards over-reliance on constitutional attacks to defend homeschooling has not been successful. In a 62-page report issued by the Wisconsin Legislative Council Staff, dated November 21, 1990 and based on reported case law (cases appealed at the state level) throughout the U. S., the evidence showed that since 1980 the constitutionality of state laws regulating home schools has not been upheld in the courts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">According to an article in Phi Delta Kappan, January, 1991, "The only constitutional strategy that has sometimes yielded success in the courts for home-instruction advocates has been to allege that statutory provisions for home instruction are constitutionally vague." While some of these authors, or the institutiions that they work for, may or may not be entirely friendly toward homeschooling interests, they often have access to information that homeschoolers can examine and assess for themselves. The legacy of these constitutional challenges has been volumes of unnecessary verbiage about how to home educate. After years of litigation homeschoolers are now living under laws and regulations that have increasingly emulated conventional schools: state mandated standardized testing, curriculum review, parental qualifications, and more. Interestingly enough, these are the kinds of services that NCHE is now moving to provide. In his letter announcing the National Center, dated February 13, 1990, Farris states, "The need for legal defense has never been a strong sales point for homeschooling. NCHE will be able to accentuate the positive side of homeschooling."</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">HSLDA/NCHE not only actively fosters a dependency on their services, which undermines individual action and responsibility, but they also promote a clear perception that there is an 'approved homeschool method,' defined in part by their membership application. This application requests information very similar to what we have come to expect from hostile school officials: test results, curriculum, academic background of the parent, notification of previous contact with officials. With its new NCHE services, HSLDA is, in effect, providing an administrative service for the school officials. When a family sends their $100 HSLDA membership they are actually supporting and strengthening this service, and the perception that there is "one approved method" of homeschooling, at the expense of all others. For ease of legal defense, HSLDA carefully selects along the lines of conventional school criteria, rather than administering to the needs of individuals or breaking new ground for freedom. Pat Montgomery, in an article entitled, "Must I Buy Homeschool Insurance?" in The Learning Edge (March, 1991), brings up some interesting statistics regarding home schooling and legal defense.</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">She states, "Of the thousands of families Clonlara has served, relatively few -- twenty-eight to be exact -- have ever had contact from local officials that could not be handled by a simple phone call or letter." Of those twenty-eight, eighteen Clonlara families were actually summoned to court between 1984 and 1990. Seventeen of them won, and sixteen of those did not hire a lawyer! Six families joined Clonlara between 1980 and 1990 while they were already involved in a court process, but only five of those were in court on home school issues. All five won their cases, and not one of them hired an attorney! As Pat sums up the issue, "The record shows that families who home educate, by and large, have little to fear from officials." Attorney John Eidsmoe, speaking on the nationally televised Moore Teleconference on Homeschooling last April, stated, "Even in restricted states, the percentage of parents who actually get prosecuted is only a little higher than the percentage who get struck by lightning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">They're very selective about who they prosecute, and the vast majority of parents, even in these states, get left alone." This is not to say that local school districts and superintendents don't harass homeschoolers on a regular basis -- they do. And special interest groups continually prompt the legislature to regulate homeschooling. But these kinds of contacts can be resolved without buying into the care and feeding of a national organization. Using The Home School Court Report, from which information is reprinted widely, HSLDA has repeatedly portrayed situations in state after state to appear much more hostile than necessary. As just one example, in the Summer, 1990 issue of The Court Report a three-column heading announces "South Dakota Restricts Home Schooling With New Regulations," and the article goes on to paint a potentially grim picture of possible complications under the new regulations. However, the August, 1990 newsletter of the South Dakota Home School Association discussed the new regulations and reported that "Our relationship with the state department of education appears to be the best it has ever been," and goes on to explain that the president of SDHSA and other homeschooling leaders "met with the department earlier in the summer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">We were received in a spirit of cooperation as they believe that most homeschoolers are doing a good job." This misinformation also comes directly out of their home office. We frequently hear reports of entire support groups being told that they are in imminent danger, when in fact no such "danger" exists. A common approach is to tell homeschoolers at conferences and conventions that there have been more contacts in their state than at any other time, and that things are only getting worse in their state instead of better. One of the most significant questions to consider is the actual competence of HSLDA's attorneys. In a meeting with Michael Farris and several others in Spokane, Washington, held in June, 1990, we asked Michael about a phone call we had placed to HSLDA, inquiring about a supposed legal situation in our own state. Yet this individual had been with HSLDA for a year at that time, is still an HSLDA attorney, and is still advising homeschooling families in several states.</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">In New York State, in 1988, in a U. S. District Court decision, Blackwelder v. Safnauer, the District Court Chief Judge issued a reprimand to Michael Farris that appears in the Federal Supplement (volume #689, page 106), "The progress of this case has been hindered by plaintiffs' failure to adhere to the procedural framework of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and this court's Local Rules. The court has been indulgent -- perhaps too indulgent -- in forgiving a multitude of procedural errors, because it has not wanted to punish the individual plaintiffs for the shoddy motion practice of their attorneys. The Judge's comment then goes on to discuss the problems caused by Farris. We need to keep in mind that what HSLDA does is lawyer stuff. That is to say, what they know how to do best is to function within the judicial system, an institution that has become increasingly insensitive to the individual and his needs. This rarefied air that they keep themselves in precludes individual action and initiative. Legalistic arguments and professional hat tricks will not gain us any greater degree of homeschooling freedom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">Responsibility and Freedom With their national visibility, HSLDA/NCHE, Christian Life Workshops, The Teaching Home, and NHERI sit atop a hierarchy that not only perpetuates itself but which purposefully advances a notion that there is primarily one "approved" method for homeschooling. This leads us, as a homeschooling community, back into the same trap of "one size fits all" education that is the very essence of the educational institution. This hierarchy that has grown up within our midst has also promised us the illusion of easy and convenient protection of our freedoms, yet their actions have had a tremendously negative impact on an already effectively functioning homeschool community, and they are largely responsible for the homeschool community's current state of disarray. What can we, as individual homeschoolers, do about this situation? We have already assumed a responsibility that is directly translated into freedom, we are homeschooling. The impact of this freedom says we, as individuals, are capable of exercising sound judgment in the face of the challenges that shape our lives. This responsibility stands in direct opposition to any individual or group that would come between us and our decision making processes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">One of the primary keys is to take steps to bring each homeschooling family into the homeschool community. Communication is the most important step. We need unrestricted communication at all levels of this community. We need communication that doesn't have to be approved by a hierarchical order but that directly serves the needs of all homeschooling families. Newsletters, phone trees, support group meetings, conferences, and conversations between friends and neighbors can be our most effective tools in working to put our communication networks - and the homeschooling community - back together. The issues raised here are not going to disappear overnight. As homeschoolers we will always face very subtle and complex challenges to our freedoms, and we must be prepared to face what comes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">The best opportunity we have to defend our freedoms is to assume the responsibility of maintaining them ourselves, by staying informed and taking action, and not relying on experts and professionals, whatever their professed accomplishments, to assume the responsibility for us. We all need to follow through on the many diverse responsibilities we assumed when we chose homeschooling for our children. Editors Note Electronic Edition - Homeschooling Freedoms At Risk: The original collection was put together to be read as a whole, and in fairness to all involved this electronic version should be no different. Because of its length, Homeschooling Freedoms At Risk has been uploaded in four parts labeled Part 1, Part 2, Part 3 and Part 4. Please read this file in its entirety. On the 10th of this month it will have been five years since we sent out a letter telling a number of associates that things had gone too far, that we recognized a pattern, that efforts to address these issues were basically being ignored by the perpetrators, and the point had been reached when this piece needed to be published. Our collective freedom to homeschool was at stake.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">Today, as we prepare for a 1996 electronic release of this collection of articles titled _Homeschooling Freedoms At Risk_, we only wonder if we erred by not publishing this piece in the 80's and/or following through with more articles and essays that cataloged the degradation of our homeschooling freedoms. Our fellow homeschoolers in Michigan are facing an uncertain future because of a bill that has found its way into the legislative process and has been passed into law. The smoking gun may be tough to find and arguable ad nauseum, but there is little doubt that at this point the only ones who have come forward to support this law have been lawyers closely associated with HSLDA and one state association. This is not the only legislation HSLDA has fostered that will codify more restrictions on us, not only as homeschoolers but as families. We have wondered about the why of all of this, and while we can only guess at and possibly demonstrate intent, the actions are undeniable. Unless you ferret out similar 'model legislation' in your own state you are in grave danger of living under greater regulations. To this end the words we wrote five years ago still ring true: "The breaking down of the homeschool community is heralding more restrictive laws and regulations for all homeschoolers."</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">Mark and Helen Hegener Publishers, Home Education Press March 5, 1996, Wauconda, WA Editors Note Electronic Edition - Homeschooling Freedoms At Risk: This is not light reading!

Homeschooling is one of the most influential grassroots movements our generation has seen come together. We are, by the very act of homeschooling, making a strong social and political statement. The lessons which homeschooling families are learning are causing ripples in every corner of this nation. People are sitting up and taking notice of this new alternative and of the amazing effect it is generating in the way we look at children, learning and the family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">And yet this very "success" has drawn the attention of those who have recognized the potential power behind the homeschool movement. Attempts to harness our collective activism are threatening our very freedom to homeschool and have prompted this special Homeschooling Freedoms at Risk feature. We consider this issue to be of critical importance to homeschooling families. The homeschool community stands at the crossroads, with a clear decision before us all: will we, as homeschooling families, maintain our individuality and our ability to make our own decisions about homeschooling matters - or will we hand those rights and responsibilities over to "experts" and their institutions which will handle homeschooling affairs for us all? We appreciate your assistance in helping us provide the homeschoolers in your area with the information they'll need to make this important decision. Sincerely, Mark and Helen Hegener Publishers, Home Education Press Homeschooling Freedoms At Risk</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">by Mark and Helen Hegener The breaking down of the homeschool community is heralding more restrictive laws and regulations for all homeschoolers. Long established support and political networks have been damaged, and in many cases replaced with new exclusive groups. Legal actions have been taken which have resulted in the strengthening of states' rights over the education of our children. A view of homeschooling has been actively promoted which advances the notion that there is only one way to homeschool, and which ties that one way to an extremely narrow range of social and political support. A sense of community has been lost and our homeschooling freedoms are being threatened. With this special section we hope to demonstrate how this loss of community affects us all, and to show how some homeschoolers have begun to respond to the alarming events we are seeing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">For the past three years hundreds of letters, conversations, phone calls, and other communications have been telling the same stories, asking the same questions, communicating feelings of confusion and bewilderment, and alerting us to an increasingly serious problem within the homeschool community. We have repeatedly attempted to address the underlying issues, and to alert people to problematic actions and directions. Now it has become obvious to us that people need to hear, clearly and unambiguously, what we and many others perceive as a serious threat to the homeschooling community. That threat is the undermining of individual responsibility, with an increasing push toward a reliance on experts and professionals, and an ever-tightening monopoly on the tools and resources that homeschooling families need. Centralizing Power and Control The problem is a small group of individuals, their organizations, and their associates, whose actions have resulted in dividing the homeschool community, breaking down networks of support and communication, and artificially imposing an exclusive hierarchical order. Actions initiated by these individuals and their organizations have increasingly resulted in the control of homeschooling being placed into the hands of a very few. Our ability to speak for and to represent ourselves is threatened.</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">Our individual and collective political strength is greatly weakened. Our homeschooling freedoms are at risk. We are talking about the actions taken by Michael Farris, Gregg Harris, Sue Welch, and Brian Ray, the group which has come to be referred to as the "four pillars of homeschooling." Whatever their individual or collective titles, their actions are inflicting hurt, anguish, pain, and sorrow on thousands of homeschooling families, and yet we have been lead to believe that their leadership is above question or comment, not subject to criticism, and beyond reproach. Individuals who have become increasingly associated with these activities include Chris Klicka, J. Richard Fugate, Mary Pride, Sharon Grimes, and several others. In addition, there are dozens of local and state leaders who directly and indirectly provide support for the centralization of power and control. Exclusive Hierarchies For many years homeschooling families have worked to build local, state and national networks that have assisted homeschoolers in maintaining their educational freedoms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">The homeschool support group became an effective and powerful tool in building these networks. At the same time, this idea of support groups for homeschooling families has provided a convenient model for those who would misuse the potential. In his book, The Christian Home School (Wolgemuth and Hyatt, 1988), Gregg Harris writes that he has used his Home Schooling Workshop to "successfully kick off the establishment of state Christian Home Education Associations and metropolitan support groups. Once established, these groups serve as our annual workshop hosts." Along with Sue Welch and her Teaching Home magazine, Harris has actively promoted a climate of exclusivism among homeschoolers, has supported the splitting of long-established coalitions, and has encouraged and assisted in the formation of new exclusivist homeschooling groups. Many new exclusive groups are being encouraged to "hide" their exclusivity, with the goal of appearing to have a much broader base of support. Many members of such groups are not even aware that their group is exclusive, or that they must sign a statement of faith to hold office within the group.</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">Most of these groups promote themselves to education officials, legislators, the media, and others outside of the homeschool community as open to all homeschoolers, when in fact their leadership adheres to a very narrow educational or ideological point of view. Groups are exhorted not to work with, sometimes not even to talk to, those homeschooling groups which are not "approved." Sue Welch, using her position as editor of The Teaching Home, has repeatedly worked to entice state groups to co-publish as an insert in this national magazine. This co-publishing arrangement weakens the existing networks in favor of an imposed exclusive hierarchy. The Teaching Home then uses these groups to lend an air of credibility to its position atop this exclusive hierarchy. This relationship has very far reaching implications. Given the editorial and advertising policies of The Teaching Home magazine, the true diversity of the homeschool community can never be recognized via the co-published inserts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">Control of this vital link in the communication process is straining local and state relationships and further lessening the ability of these groups to work cohesively. This also, in turn, increases the dependency on outside "expert help" in the face of adversity. In states where there was no group whose leaders chose to sign a statement of faith necessary for co-publication, Sue and others have designated support groups, sometimes small and very localized support groups, to be the new state Christian organization. Or they have simply implanted new organizations altogether, often by orchestrating the takeover of an existing open support group. In the September/October 1990 issue of Florida's FPEA Almanac, a letter to the editor asked, "Just when things are beginning to get really organized and are running well for the F.P.E.A., why is someone stirring things up by talking about a Christian organization? They tried this about six years ago, and it fell flat on its face. I am, of course, referring to the article in Florida at Home in The Teaching Home, where it stated that 'they' (whoever they are) are 'calling Christians to action.'</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">I would like to go on record stating that the Christians are already in action... in F.P.E.A.! I'd also like to know where Sue Welch gets off suggesting that the 'Christians in Florida need to come forth and organize.' The Teaching Home is supposed to be a magazine that ministers to the needs of Christian homeschoolers (and to many others who subscribe and are not Christian), NOT to be an instigator of 'exclusively Christian groups,' especially in a state where it is not needed." Alabama's The Voice newsletter, Summer, 1990, reported, "It has been proposed that a doctrinal statement be signed by all AHE Directors and Officers. The irony of the situation is that the very people in Alabama wanting to require a signed statement of faith from all present and future AHE leaders received free 'non-sectarian' brochures and pamphlets upon request to help them begin homeschooling!" In a letter to our September/October, 1989 issue Joyce Spurgin wrote, "Oklahoma Central Home Educators Consociation sent us and other 'leaders' a leadership agreement that we are required to sign in order to be 'leaders.' Perhaps we are the only homeschooling family in the state who refuses to sign statements of faith.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">However, I can't keep from thinking that there must be others out there like us, or why would there be such a big effort to make sure we are excluded." The proponents of exclusivism are wreaking havoc in state after state by breaking down lines of communication, circumventing effective network building, weakening existing networks, imposing artificial organizational structures, co-opting individual responsibility and fostering a dependency on outside groups and individuals. There's a definite pattern, a self-perpetuating cycle that supports exclusive groups, locking many homeschoolers out of new networks and driving others from existing networks. The formation of this exclusive hierarchy brings the complex underlying issues of religious intolerance and domination into the homeschool community. Our founding fathers grappled with this issue, and the world faces this same problem today in country after country. There can be no freedom of any sort when one group dominates another. The rationale that urges an exclusive hierarchy is the rationale for religious domination, which serves to encourage a climate of religious intolerance within the hierarchy itself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">It is often advantageous to skirt the issue of religious domination, those who draw their political power from exclusive hierarchies demonstrate that there can be very tangible rewards in fanning the flames of religious intolerance. Neither domination nor intolerance will lead in any way to a greater degree of freedom for any of us. The freedom of each and every homeschooling family depends on the homeschooling community's ability to come to grips with this issue. Shaping Society's Perceptions The imposition of exclusive hierarchies makes it much harder for the rest of the homeschooling community to be heard on matters that directly affect their families and thereby they are often rendered politically silent. This paves the way for those in leadership positions within the exclusive hierarchies to represent only their particular brand of homeschooling to legislators, the national media, education officials, and others who are interested in homeschooling. In the process of destroying networks and centralizing control, only the "right kind of Christian" can be elevated to a position of leadership. Yet by claiming to represent all homeschoolers, these selected leaders are fostering society's view that the majority of homeschooling families are "religious fanatics."</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">This results in a narrowing of political support for homeschooling, so that instead of becoming broader and stronger, the movement as a whole is contracting and weakening. The controversy that surrounded Senate Bill 695 last year provided a good example of this kind of political damage. In an article addressing that subject we wrote, "Because this was not considered a homeschooling issue by Congressional staffers, homeschoolers have now been labelled as an uninformed, inarticulate group which merely reacts to phone tree calls to legislative action. It will take careful rebuilding to undo the harm that has been done to the homeschool movement." And yet Michael Farris used the entire event as a grandstanding opportunity to launch his latest project, boldly announcing, "This episode with S. 695 serves as absolute confirmation of the immediate need for the National Center for Home Education (NCHE). We are glad that our plans were well underway so that we have a plan for the future that can be implemented right away." It is a sad irony that it can be much more difficult today to find an accurate portrayal of homeschooling than it was ten years ago.</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">In 1981 it may have taken some serious digging to find information on the option, but the information was there, and it had broad appeal to those who were ready for it. In 1991 one certainly doesn't have to look very far to find newsletters, conferences, books, and much more on the subject of homeschooling, but those sources are more than likely to be so one-sided and misleading as to be utterly discouraging. This pool of one-sided information on homeschooling is gaining new legitimacy. Brian Ray, as the research arm of the four pillars, has repeatedly allowed the use of his research results to support the goals of isolationism, portraying and advancing an extremely narrow definition of homeschooling. The Christmas, 1990 edition of The Home School Court Report featured initial results from a nationwide survey commissioned by NCHE and directed by Brian Ray. The survey's target population for the study was home education families who are members of HSLDA. 1,516 families responded to the survey, which was touted by Michael Farris as "the most extensive of its kind in terms of national scope, the subjects covered, and the number of homeschooling families participating."</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">Michael goes on to say, "The public policy implications of these numbers are obvious." Can he be serious in suggesting that there are public policy implications in a survey purchased by NCHE and targeting only members of HSLDA? Given the small percentage of the total homeschool population that HSLDA represents, shouldn't the narrow scope of such a survey be obvious to anyone? Apparently not. The population for this survey was limited to a very narrow segment of the homeschool community: those few homeschoolers who currently support the idea that the best legal protection is a central agency, and who fit HSLDA's membership criteria. And yet, in an article for Education Week, February 13, 1991, reporter Mark Walsh wrote favorably of this "new national study" of homeschooled students, conducted by The National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI). In an article for the March, 1991 issue of US Air, writer Greg Monfils also relies on statistics from this research.</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">The perceptions fostered by this "national" research project, done under the auspices of a "national" research institute, and funded by a "national" center, are misleading. The narrow scope of this research project, coupled with the overriding legitimacy its use is giving it, is a betrayal of the entire homeschooling community. Some people in my homeschooling support group have expressed concern about the California homeschooling law and say that we need to work on getting a new one. It is important to understand that California does not have a &#65533;homeschooling law&#65533; as such. What homeschoolers do is clearly authorized under the private schools provisions of the California Education Code: homeschoolers need only file a simple private school form with their County Office of Education each fall in order to comply fully with the law. Over the years a few local and state school officials and publicity-seeking politicians have attempted to make the case that homeschooling is not &#65533;private schooling&#65533; and therefore homeschooling is not protected by that provision of the Code. These efforts have failed in every instance simply because the Code as written does not define precisely what a private school is or is not, and efforts by homeschooling opponents to define it in such a way as to exclude homeschoolers have ranged from inept to embarrassing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">(Sitting on a homeschooling panel in Sacramento some years ago, we listened to the now retired State Department of Education&#65533;s top attorney argue that homeschoolers did not meet his private school code criteria: they did not advertise or otherwise recruit students and were not profit-oriented, incorporated, or big enough. Of course none of his criteria are specified in the Ed Code, and he had a very rough time of it in the ensuing discussion). So why, then, the almost cyclical push for a &#65533;new&#65533; homeschooling law? One reason may be that when homeschooling comes under legal fire from one quarter or another, we cannot point to a clear set of laws, rules and regulations that define who we are and what we do, and so defense efforts become messy, albeit invariably successful. For those who seek legal clarity, a new law would indeed be an improvement. Another reason is that those who sell legal &#65533;protection&#65533; to homeschoolers in other states might find it easier to defend California clients if a clear homeschooling law were in place. And yet another reason might be that there are those of us who feel that as homeschoolers we are traveling, as it were, under false colors, that we are not private school operators but homeschoolers and should be recognized as such.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">They why shouldn&#65533;t California homeschoolers push for a homeschooling law? And the fact is, the present Education Code serves us very well indeed, precisely because it is vague and non specific. But there is a better reason why California homeschoolers would be very foolish indeed to push for a &#65533;new&#65533; homeschooling law. All we have to do is look at the body which would be responsible for the passage of such a law--the California state legislature. Here is a body that is--to put it as kindly as possible--massively influenced by the teachers&#65533; unions--the biggest contributors to state assembly and senate campaigns--as well as by the education establishment in general. Given the dismal state of public education in California today (it ranks below Alabama and Mississippi on many performance indicators) there is little question that the unions and educrats would gleefully seize upon the opportunity to &#65533;cooperate&#65533; in a misguided effort by homeschooling activists to write a &#65533;good&#65533; homeschooling law. California homeschoolers who might be inclined to support a movement for a &#65533;new&#65533; homeschooling law should take a close look at what has happened in other states in which homeschooling law revision efforts were mounted.</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">In general, where the education lobbies were weak and homeschooling was difficult under existing statues, those efforts helped homeschoolers. But where education lobbies were strong, and where efforts were undertaken to &#65533;improve&#65533; flawed but not prohibitively restrictive statues, results ranged from poor to very bad. In several instances laws were clarified, to be sure, and homeschooling was given legal standing, but at the unacceptable (to us) cost of giving the state greater control over credentialing, testing, and curriculum. In short, yes, it would be good to have a good homeschooling law in California. Is it likely that we could get such a law? No. Is it possible that if we start tampering with the Education Code we could end up with something far worse than what we operate under today?</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">In our opinion, based on our understanding of California politics and the State Department of Education, it is more than possible: it is all but inevitable. Our advice to your support group friends: Give your children the time you might have spent on worrying about our flabby Ed Code; it&#65533;ll be far better spent. What do you think? M.A., Berkeley, CA This is an issue that comes up from time to time in homeschooling circles and one which we have often said is not worth a whole lot of attention. The easy answer is the cliche that if something isn&#65533;t broken, it doesn&#65533;t need to be fixed. I have heard you speak at homeschooling conferences about college admissions, where you&#65533;ve said that at some point it becomes necessary for the homeschooler to find out what is required to do well on the admissions tests and to spend a lot of time preparing for those tests.</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">Isn&#65533;t that a repudiation of what homeschooling is all about? A.V., Vancouver, B.C. Several good points are raised in this question and we&#65533;ll try to do it justice, starting with your last point. We suppose that if our boys had not left home at 17 or 18 and continued to live and work on the ranch, reading, writing, and talking for the next four or five years much as before, they might have learned as much, and in some ways more, than they would at college. Indeed, if they hung around for another few years they almost certainly would have learned infinitely more than they would have in most contemporary graduate programs in sociology or English! And that&#65533;s why we told each one, as he headed off to college, that his education was done, that now they were going off to get credentials. And among other things, the fact remains that college and university programs are for the most part credentialing, certifying, or pre professional operations, a mix of channels and barriers that regulate the flow of people into certain sectors and occupations in the work force.</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">Of course most people don&#65533;t need these credentials in order to find work of one sort or another, but as one critic has observed, we are becoming an increasingly &#65533;credentialized society,&#65533; and since our children were interested in going into occupations that require those kinds of credentials, college was an appropriate option. And while it is still possible to be a journalist or a farmer, for example, or to engage in thousands of other occupations without credentials that are backed by the full force of law, it is not only difficult but illegal to practice law or medicine--and thousands of other occupations--without possessing the kind of credentials that homeschooling parents, however competent, cannot confer. Which takes us to the first part of your question: Being prepared for a world in which tests--however silly, invalid, or demeaning--may make sense in one situation and no sense whatsoever in another. And while we like to think of homeschooling as an enterprise in which learning is meaningful, satisfying, and its own reward, we live in a world in which these considerations are scarcely honored, if at all. If one is to live in such a world--which is not to say that there are not a multiplicity of strategies for challenging the absurdities of that world--it makes sense to develop the kind of skills that allows one to cope effectively with its demands. Like it or not, it isn&#65533;t possible to practice medicine or dress hair without the proper licenses, and there is not much that homeschoolers can do about it. In an article announcing the establishment of the National Center for Home Education in The Teaching Home, April/May, 1990, Farris wrote, "The National Center will seek to provide an active presence in Washington, D. C., representing homeschooling interests."</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">In the same article Farris talked about promoting "aggressive media relations and placement of public service announcements as required for national issues," and stated that "HSLDA is already involved in many of these activities. We need to rely instead on the kind of good old fashioned wisdom and sound judgement that we can gain from our own experience. Feeling that we had been given blatant misinformation by the attorney we talked with, we asked Michael about the incident. His reply was that this particular attorney was "not really a very good lawyer," and that they were not sure "whether or not he was going to work out." There comes a point, however, when forbearance of one party's carelessness unfairly prejudices their adversaries. That point has been reached in this case." In March 2003, Home School Legal Defense Association alerted its members to the plight of six small-town families arrested for homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">At first glance, this may have seemed unusual. Are families actually arrested for homeschooling anymore? While it is almost unheard of for parents to be arrested for educating their children at home in the United States, it is occurring with increasing frequency in other countries around the world as more parents choose to teach their own children. The six families in question live in Ukraine. Word reached Home School Legal Defense Association through a Russian missionary that legal proceedings were underway to deprive these families of their parental rights and remove their children from their homes. Ironically, the law in Ukraine, a country controlled until recently by the communist Soviet Union, allows for homeschooling. Yet local officials in the Kaliya region of Ukraine were prosecuting homeschoolers anyway.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">These Ukrainian families were eventually allowed to continue homeschooling in peace, due in large part to the outcry from HSLDA members in the United States. This situation is a prime example of how homeschooling is growing around the world, and how homeschoolers in the United States can help spread educational freedom and parents' rights. Homeschooling goes global It is clear that home education is no longer just an American phenomenon. For years now, HSLDA has watched homeschooling spread well beyond the borders of the United States. In Canada, homeschooling took off in the 1980s almost as soon as it did in America. Then other Western nations, such as Australia, New Zealand, England, and South Africa, caught on to the idea. "Our involvement internationally started with inquiries from homeschoolers moving out of the United States," says Michael Smith, president of HSLDA.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">"As time went on, however, we began to get requests for help from citizens of other countries where homeschooling was illegal." American missionaries and military families who homeschool introduced many in other countries to home education. Parents around the world were beginning to react to the problems of institutionalized government-run schools. Soon more of Europe and parts of Asia began to see parents looking into home education. They contacted HSLDA to find out what had happened in the United States and to get ideas for their own legal and grassroots strategies to legalize homeschooling. "It was exciting for us [HSLDA] to be the ones they were contacting for help," says Chris Klicka, HSLDA's attorney who now handles international contacts. In addition, the advent of the World Wide Web facilitated the flow of information about homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">Over the internet, parents in other countries could easily discover an array of information on the success of homeschooling. The fights for freedom In the early 1990s, HSLDA began studying international home education. In addition to becoming a clearinghouse for information, helping draft laws, and advising government officials and homeschool leaders in other countries, HSLDA began to encourage American homeschoolers to help by sending out national alerts asking them to contact foreign embassies and parliaments. This involvement by the United States has had significant impact. In South Africa, two homeschooling parents were freed from prison. Eventually, home education was legalized after U.S. homeschoolers flooded the South African embassy with phone calls. In Germany, a 1998 case against a homeschooling family was dropped within three weeks after thousands of calls were made to the German embassy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">Another case decided in a homeschooling family's favor this year became the first formal recognition of the validity of homeschooling in Germany. Legislation in Ireland that would have enforced a draconian home visit policy was defeated after U.S. homeschoolers contacted the Irish embassy to protest. HSLDA also worked with the parliament in Ireland to craft a bill that was less restrictive on homeschoolers. When the parliament of the Czech Republic introduced a bill that would have made it nearly impossible to homeschool, over 170,000 emails were delivered by U.S. homeschoolers, shutting down the parliament email servers and starting a campaign that defeated the legislation. Understanding the legal climates Despite these successes, not every political battle has been won for homeschoolers in other countries. Americans have tried without success to help homeschoolers in Brazil gain legal status for homeschooling. "The Higher Court of Justice in Brazil has declared that there are no laws giving parents the right to replace approved teachers," according to Julio Severo, a Brazilian journalist who assists the homeschoolers there.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">"The Court has opined that the only role of parents is to help their children in the education they receive in the institutional schools." Homeschooling has made great strides around the world, yet many homeschoolers in other countries face difficulties unknown to American homeschoolers. "In the United States," says Mike Smith, "the 9th Amendment to the Constitution says that if the government has not made an activity legal-or illegal-it is presumed the activity is legal. In many other countries, if there is not a law allowing something, it's often forbidden. This can apply to homeschooling." In addition, very few countries around the world have the long-standing legal tradition that parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. "Precedents in favor of parents' rights support the legal right to homeschool in the United States.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">Many other countries do not enjoy such precedents," says Smith. Despite the odds against them, several fledgling homeschool movements have emerged in this region. In recent months HSLDA has assisted homeschool groups not only in Ukraine and the Czech Republic, but also in Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland. These groups are working hard to get homeschooling laws passed in their own countries. Learning from other cultures While homeschoolers around the world are discovering how our nation has won the freedom to home educate, families in the United States can learn much from how other cultures approach homeschooling. In Japan, the success of homeschoolers has caught the attention of the business community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Many businessmen in that country are looking for ways to assist Japan's homeschooling movement, which now numbers approximately 2500 families. Japanese corporations no longer want "factory workers"; they want graduates with ingenuity, creativity, and independent thinking. Homeschoolers in America should be looking for ways they can encourage businesses in the United States to do the same. Craig Smith, a homeschool leader from New Zealand, suggests other areas in which U.S. homeschoolers can learn from their foreign counterparts. "I often think we New Zealanders could show you folks in the United States how not to be so tied to rigid and expensive curriculum programs . . . and commercialized traditions such as graduation ceremonies." That is the gift of homeschooling expanding across the globe-from innovative business partnerships modeled by the Japanese to frank observations from our Kiwi friends: American homeschoolers can be challenged to continue grow and explore, making homeschooling better than ever. Solidarity But for homeschoolers in places like Brazil, Bulgaria, Romania, and Spain, who are fighting for basic parental rights and educational choice, there has not yet been time to see how their cultures' homeschooling movements will develop.</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">"HSLDA remains committed to advancing homeschooling in other countries, through supporting individual families and encouraging foreign governments to look favorably on homeschooling," says Mike Smith. "Freedom requires sacrifice and effort, but we are confident that the reward will be great. And we believe that these families-and nations-will reap the benefits for many generations to come." Fortunately, the states in the immediate area - - Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas -- do not have minimum teaching requirements to begin homeschooling. Parents can refer to the HSLDA website for more information on the specific requirements in the various states. Home School Legal Defense Association provides information about legislation, homeschoolers' performance and more at hslda.org. In addition to free information, HSLDA offers affordable memberships which supply: &#8226; Full legal representation in court, should a homeschooling challenge arise.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">&#8226; A subscription to the Home School Court Report - the definitive resource for homeschool legislative updates and HSLDA action. Any parent can take advantage of his or her right to direct the child's education. Recovering from the tragedy will be a long-term project. But when the old has been washed away, it's also a chance to begin something new. Many may find this is an ideal time to begin homeschooling. On the other hand, visiting your legislator simply to introduce yourself and explain the benefits of homeschooling could provide a positive connection. FPM, in teamwork with CHEA and HSLDA, has developed a "Legislator Packet" for this purpose.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">To request this packet, call FPM at 916-786-3523.

Be an ambassador for homeschooling. While many people have expressed support for homeschoolers and homeschool freedom in California during this crisis, others have claimed that more oversight is required. "We have a PR problem," says Schwarzer. "We need to show the public that homeschoolers are just like any of their other neighbors-they're responsible people, their kids are well-behaved."</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">The HomeSchool Association of California urges homeschoolers to write letters to the editors of their newspapers, demonstrating the success of homeschooling. During the day, homeschool. Don't be out at the gym, or out to lunch, or shopping in the mall." "Don't be afraid that you're homeschooling. Do your best," encourages Marcia Neill, a homeschooling mom in Irvine, California. "Families from state to state need to be a team. This is just another opportunity for all homeschoolers to show their support and loyalty to each other."</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">Pray for a positive outcome in the case, and pray for those involved: the L family, attorneys, judges, and homeschool organizations in California. Remember California homeschoolers in prayer as well. Mary Schofield encourages parents to "continue doing what you're doing-an outstanding job of raising and educating your children." She continues, "In the early days of homeschooling in the 1980s, most homeschoolers were told erroneously by government officials that homeschooling was illegal-and it didn't stop us."

Klicka, "The Myth of Teacher Qualifications," September 2007, www.hslda.org/teacherqualifications; Lawrence M. Rudner, Home Schooling Works , HSLDA, 1999. That was the question on many parents' minds after February 28, 2008, the day the California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District in Los Angeles declared homeschooling illegal in the Golden State unless the parent is a certified teacher. Home School Legal Defense Association President Mike Smith shared Andrus' reaction. "To say that I was shocked that the court in California ruled that teacher's certification was the only legal way to teach a child in California is putting it mildly," he says. Rather than review the juvenile court's decision about safety, the Court of Appeal then decided that homeschooling is illegal in California unless the parent possesses teacher certification. As the media churned out articles and radio shows picked up the story, the general public joined homeschoolers in expressing disbelief that an educational alternative as solidly established as homeschooling was actually being called illegal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">The court's decision to rehear the case automatically voids the previous court opinion declaring homeschooling to be illegal. Submitted to the court on April 28, 2008, the brief argues that homeschooling under the private school exemption from public school attendance is a legal and constitutional option in California. "From a legal standpoint, the opinion was just not well crafted," says HSLDA Litigation Counsel Jim Mason. "From a legal standpoint, the opinion was just not well crafted," says Jim Mason. "The court only looked at old cases, and there's a much larger body of legal and legislative history that they should have looked at-none of that was mentioned. In so doing, the court neglected other important facts that shed light on the legality of homeschooling under the private school exemption. The number one goal is to ensure homeschoolers' continued ability to be legal by complying with the private school law, insist HSLDA Chairman Mike Farris and President Mike Smith.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">After O'Connell became superintendent, he promptly ordered the removal of wording put on the CDE website during Eastin's term declaring homeschooling to be illegal. "The legal climate surrounding homeschooling calmed down considerably," says Debbie Schwarzer. "It reminded me of the days when HSLDA began 25 years ago and teacher's certification was the 'sacred cow' that states were clinging to in an effort to keep homeschooling from becoming a viable option." Homeschooling became an issue in the case when the children's court-appointed attorneys asked the court to order that the children be sent to public or private school for their safety. When the judge refused, believing the parents had a constitutional right to educate their children, the children's attorneys filed a writ in the California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District. California member families called HSLDA, wondering if they should move out of the state, or when a truant officer would come knocking at their door and demand their children. "People were clamoring for details, wanting to know how much it affected them and their immediate ability to homeschool," says Roy Hanson, director of Private and Home Educators of California, a program of Family Protection Ministries (FPM).</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">I participate in an internet forum of people from all over the world-people of every imaginable stripe-and I've heard a lot of outrage from that quarter, too." In late March, the L family's attorney submitted a petition for rehearing to the appeals court-researched and written with substantial assistance from HSLDA. On March 25, 2008, in a remarkable turn of events, the court granted the petition. "It was vacated, which means it was erased, but it doesn't mean the judges' philosophies have changed-we're going to get another decision by the same judges and we don't know how that's going to come out," Farris cautions. "I was very relieved when the rehearing was announced," says Mary Schofield, vice president of Christian Home Educators Association of California (CHEA). The Court of Appeal is now considering a second brief filed by the L family, who are represented by attorneys from the United States Justice Foundation and the Alliance Defense Fund. HSLDA attorneys again contributed to the brief.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">Invited parties include the California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the California Department of Education, the Los Angeles Unified School District, and the California Federation of Teachers. Do California statutes permit homeschooling by the means used by Sunland [the private school through which the L family did "independent study"]; that is, by enrolling the children in a private school which apparently exists only to enable the parents to homeschool their children via independent study? Do California statutes otherwise permit homeschooling, by means of parents creating their own home-based private schools and, if so, upon what conditions? In light of the answers to the above questions, does the California legislative scheme violate the U.S. Constitution, with respect to the free exercise of religion and parental control rights of parents who desire to homeschool their children? The court hands down rulings on its own timetable. Its first ruling in this case was handed down just three months after the oral argument. "It may rule before the end of summer," says Mason, "or we may have to wait a little longer."</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">Is Homeschooling Legal in California? Yes! Although the law doesn't contain the word homeschooling , four viable options for this educational alternative exist in California. 3 Based upon the California Education Code (EC), parents can: Establish a private school; Employ a certified tutor; Enroll in a private school independent study program (ISP); or</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">Enroll in an independent study program through a public school. The private school exemption from public school attendance can be applied to homeschoolers. The actual statute governing private schools in California says, "Children who are being instructed in a private full-time day school by persons capable of teaching shall be exempted" 4 (italics added). There is no requirement that the teacher of a private school be certified. The statute goes on to list the other requirements for private full-time day schools: Instruction shall be in English; Instruction must be "in the several branches of study required to be taught in the public schools of the state";</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">Pupil attendance must be kept in a register, and "the record of attendance shall indicate clearly every absence of the pupil from school for a half day or more during each day that school is maintained during the year"; and The owner or other head of a private school must annually file an affidavit or statement of prescribed information with the California Superintendent of Public Instruction. "HSLDA has successfully contended for years that the private school exemption applies to homeschoolers," says Mike Smith. "It's a proper statutory interpretation, and constitutionally, we believe we're right in using it. There is nothing in the private school law that prevents an individual from filing a private school affidavit, thereby setting up a private school in their home." "We have a good homeschool law in California because we are one of the 12 states where we operate under the private school exemption," says Roy Hanson. The two private school options were threatened by the original Court of Appeal decision; with the decision being vacated, however, the law is now interpreted as it always was.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">Although Californians have been homeschooling under the private school exemption for over 20 years, the fact that the law doesn't directly mention homeschooling has been leveraged by opponents to argue against the private school option. Public schools receive federal and state average daily attendance (ADA) funding based on the number of students in attendance. To the school districts, homeschoolers represent money that they aren't receiving. Officials also claim they're afraid homeschoolers will slip through the cracks and more regulation is needed. Others just do not trust parents to teach their own children. "Some people argue that the right to homeschool as a private school is a loophole in the law," says Debbie Schwarzer, co-chair of the legal team for the HomeSchool Association of California (HSC). "It's not a loophole; it's as plain as the nose on my face that anybody can start a private school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">We're behaving legally and above board and doing exactly what the big Catholic high school down the street does." FPM Director Roy Hanson and Legislative Liaison Jim Davis believe that "we have a good homeschool law under the private school exemption-we don't want to lose that." "For a three-judge panel to declare that all California homeschoolers would need a teaching credential in order to homeschool legally just didn't fit with existing state law or custom," explains Karen Taylor, vice president of the California Homeschool Network (CHN). "Both the California Department of Education and California's legislators have been fully aware that parents were teaching their children, and that private school law says that the teacher must be capable of teaching, without defining that further." I was pretty confident that the reason they didn't mention it was because none of the parties involved in the case brought it to their attention." In its decision, the three-judge panel for the Court of Appeal relied heavily on the reasoning of two outdated cases referenced in the section of California's Education Code dealing with the private school exemption. The California Department of Education (CDE) supports private homeschoolers without a teaching credential,</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">A 1998 amendment to California's Education Code recognizes homeschooling parents as private school teachers, Teacher certification is no longer required for homeschooling parents in any part of the U.S., and Today, private homeschooling in California and throughout the 50 states is an established, successful educational alternative. The California Department of Education spells out how homeschoolers can create a private school in the home. According to the CDE website, "A parent offering or providing private school instruction and who meets the requirements of EC Section 33190 may file an Affidavit in the manner described." 5 Although a few CDE officials have expressed vehement opposition to homeschooling at different times over the years, the CDE's historical position toward homeschoolers has been one of support. In a statement on March 11, 2008, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell reaffirmed CDE's support: "I have reviewed this case, and I want to assure parents that choose to home school that California Department of Education policy will not change in any way as a result of this ruling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">Parents still have the right to home school in our state . [S]ome parents choose to send their children to private schools or to home school, and I respect that right." Additionally, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger took a firm stand beside homeschoolers. In a March 7 press release, Schwarzenegger stated that "Every California child deserves a quality education and parents should have the right to decide what's best for their children. Parents should not be penalized for acting in the best interests of their children's education. This outrageous ruling must be overturned by the courts and if the courts don't protect parents' rights then, as elected officials, we will." However, the background check and fingerprint requirement was amended in 1998 to exempt "a parent or legal guardian working exclusively with his or her children."</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">"If it isn't legal for parents to teach their own kids at home under the private school exemption, what other possible circumstance could the legislature have had in mind where 'a parent working exclusively with his or her children' would exist?" California's major statewide private homeschool organizations have mobilized and, together with HSLDA, are working to keep concerned citizens informed and lobby the California State Legislature in support of the legality of homeschooling under the private school law. "Our number one goal is to make sure that homeschools in California have the continued ability to be legal by complying with the private school law." He and his staff distribute information about the success of homeschooling and the legality of homeschooling in California, encourage support of Assembly Concurrent Resolution (ACR) 115 (a resolution simply stating support for homeschool freedom), and explain that a homeschool law is unnecessary. With a staff of attorneys well-versed in the homeschool law of all 50 states, HSLDA offers its members 24/7 legal protection. Top government officials aren't the only ones backing HSLDA's interpretation of the law. As already mentioned, the California Education Code itself acknowledges California parents who homeschool under the private school exemption.</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">In its decision, the Court of Appeal neglected to consider a crucial amendment to the EC. The code states that anyone who teaches children in a private school must have a criminal background check and submit fingerprints. says Jim Mason. "There isn't any." The history of this amendment clarifies the meaning completely. Family Protection Ministries, in consultation with HSLDA, requested that this exception become part of the statute. The intent of the amendment is to protect homeschooling parents under the private school law.</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">Teacher certification is another issue that the Court of Appeal addressed without looking at all the facts. Today, no state in the U.S. requires a parent to be certified to teach their children at home-in 1993, Michigan became the last state to abolish the requirement for homeschoolers. "Most homeschooling parents are uncertified," says Mike Smith. "Requiring certification would put an impossible burden on these parents, who are already doing an excellent job with their children." The California Court of Appeal would be hard-pressed to demonstrate a need for teacher certification among today's homeschoolers. Aside from the fact that no other states require it, education research shows no correlation between teacher certification and student performance, and more specific statistics show that whether or not a homeschooling parent is certified as a teacher has no effect on a homeschooled student's academic performance. Courtesy of the family</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">"This is an attack, but we're going to win," says Marcia Neill (front row, left), homeschooling mother and director of the St. Michael the Archangel Academy Private School. In its decision, the Court of Appeal also substantially relied on the findings of two outdated cases, from 1953 and 1961. "The court looked at cases that are older than dirt, one being virtually irrelevant because of the growth and maturity of the homeschool movement as compared to 55 years ago," says Mike Smith. For instance, in the 1953 case, People v. Turner , the court ruled against a family homeschooling as a private school. One of the problems with Turner is its method of reasoning. In balancing the interest of the state and the interest of the parents, the court relied on the older "reasonableness" test, which has since been declared invalid in situations dealing with fundamental rights. Today, instead of using the "reasonableness" test, the court would be required to apply the "compelling interest/least restrictive means" test.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">In other words, the court would have to demonstrate that requiring parents to be credentialed teachers before teaching their own children is the least restrictive means to achieving the state's interest. Because of the success of home education, and the fact that no other state requires a homeschooling parent to be a certified teacher, such an argument would be difficult to uphold. Furthermore, the decision in Turner was based on the court's belief that monitoring homeschools would be too burdensome for local school districts. However, the private school affidavit filing requirement was added to the Education Code in 1976, placing very little supervision responsibility on school districts. In fact, school districts are not even given the power to inspect, regulate, or approve a private school. In effect, therefore, the foundation of the Turner decision has been rendered moot. In the second court case, In re Shinn , the court followed the example of Turner in relying on the now outdated "reasonableness" test when determining whether or not a homeschooling family met the requirements to operate a private school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="115">The court determined that the family was not in compliance with the private school requirements, but the logical conclusion is that if the family had been meeting the requirements, their homeschool would have been considered a private school under California law. As a result, this case actually supports homeschooling under the private school exemption. There's more. Tens of thousands of children are being homeschooled in California today. Homeschooling is not a fringe movement, and the academic success of homeschooling is well documented and acknowledged by the media and general public. "One of the things that HSLDA will do in its amicus brief is point out the benefits of home education," says Smith. "It's possible that this court had no concept of what homeschooling is today."</paragraph><paragraph parID="116">"Homeschooling is not typically done by people who don't love and deeply care for their children," says parent Grace Andrus. "People who stop their careers as I did (the position as mayor being a 'spare time,' voluntary elected position) to stay home with their children, spending quality time teaching them, are likely not abusive people." "It's important that we fight the bias and prejudice that are often placed on homeschooling families," she continues. Mike Farris acknowledges the possibility that the Court of Appeal case could be part of an anti-freedom trend, fueled by statist officials who believe that without the government, parents cannot successfully raise children. He likens the California Court of Appeal's original decision to the 2003 decision of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which held that the interests of the state and of society in general override a parent's right to homeschool (this ruling was upheld in 2006 by the European Court of Human Rights). "The question is whether or not this California decision is a throwback to the dark days of the early 1980s, or whether it's the forerunner of the new Dark Ages foreshadowed by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany," says Farris. "There are any number of ways the court could rule," says Jim Mason.</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">"It's all conjecture at this point. Whatever happens, HSLDA will be evaluating the next step." Mike Smith advises homeschoolers to continue homeschooling. "Until the decision comes down, we operate as we always have," he says. "We certainly don't want to see people leaving the state of California because of this decision." At this stage of the battle, while the organizations are collaborating on the amicus briefs that will be submitted to the Court of Appeal in May, the most important goal is to prevent the California legislature from creating a homeschool law. Attempts to define homeschooling in a new law will almost certainly result in tighter government control over home educators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">"The current law that private schools have to comply with is the best we could possibly hope for," says Mike Farris. "Governor Schwarzenegger indicated that if the court did not fix this problem of deprivation of parental rights, then it would be corrected in other ways, hinting that the legislature should fix the problems," says Mike Smith. "Legislation would certainly not be our first, or even our second choice." Hanson says that the moment news of the Court of Appeal decision broke, his organization was scrambling to stop well-meaning legislators from introducing legislation that would be premature and dangerous to homeschooling freedom. Lobbying is another key objective of these statewide homeschool organizations. "We've been working directly and intensely with the legislature," says Hanson. Debbie Schwarzer stresses the need to convince legislators of the diversity of homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">"I think one of the most important things is to convince legislators in Sacramento that homeschooling isn't a partisan issue," she says. "If we [CHN] simply tell parents they have the right to homeschool, they might still have some nagging doubts. But if they know where to read the educational code that applies to them, their knowledge will be firsthand," she says.

You can help support this resolution by following the action steps on the latest Joint Action Alert from Private and Home Educators of California and HSLDA.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">Mary Schofield says CHEA requested the help of its members to write and call legislators to support ACR 115. "Some of the legislators showed me plastic bins full of letters from constituents, asking them to support homeschooling and in particular to support the resolution," says Schofield. "Our members have been very helpful." Don't contact California legislators, or the Supreme Court, about the Court of Appeal decision. HSLDA urges parents to refrain from calling or emailing legislators and the Supreme Court regarding the specific issue of the Court of Appeal decision, especially since that original decision is no longer in effect. Frequent contacts on this issue would likely irritate these leaders and/or may spark attempts to define homeschooling through legislation. Dealing with legal issues in homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">There are a number of legal issues that must be considered when you're beginning your homeschool. Each state has their own rules and laws governing how you run your homeschool. In addition to that, many districts have oversight of the homeschoolers in their area. It can sometimes be overwhelming for new homeschoolers to know what they can and cannot do in their homeschool. For me, the best way to learn what was required of me and my homeschool was to use HLA . They have a wonderful tool that will list, by state, what homeschoolers are required to do and required to report. You also know that if you are ever contacted by a truancy officer or social services worker on a homeschooling matter you can call HLA and they will offer legal advice, and representation, if necessary.</paragraph><paragraph parID="124">Having a professional you can call on about such important issues as the legality of your homeschool help this homeschooler sleep better at night. And no matter if you read up on the legal issues yourself, or use an outside group like HLA, make sure that you are keeping accurate, up-to-date records of what you are teaching and how your child is progressing in your homeschool. That way if you're homeschooling is ever questioned you have the documentation necessary to prove that you are teaching your child.

Additionally, we work closely with many groups to monitor legislation that may impact homeschooling. Parents have the right to choose whatever form of education they wish for their children.

After concerns expressed by member families who live within 1,000 feet of a school and own guns, we asked the United States Attorney General&#146;s Office whether this law applied to private homeschools or not. The United States Attorney General&#146;s Office has indicated that the law does not apply to these private homeschool situations. The types of inquiries range from individuals who are being prosecuted for homeschooling to those who are seeking to change their country&#146;s law to improve the atmosphere for homeschooling, or who are establishing their own homeschool association.

All we ask is that you keep a record of what your child learns so we can defend you should your homeschooling methods come under scrutiny. HSLDA membership is open to all who choose to exercise their fundamental parental right to educate their children at home. The Home School Foundation is a related organization of HSLDA. HSF was founded by HSLDA to provide assistance to homeschooling families in need, preserve parental freedoms, promote homeschooling, and support like-minded organizations. We believe this would jeopardize our liberty to teach our children at home and bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</paragraph><paragraph parID="137">We view media work as integral to a serious organizational effort to inform the general public about the many positive aspects of homeschooling. We work in conjunction with secular and religious groups alike to promote and protect home education freedoms. Homeschooling through charter schools or public school independent study programs is actually a form of public education, and thus falls outside of HSLDA's mission. It is our longstanding policy not to accept as HSLDA members families whose children are enrolled in such a public school option. For example, religious content in a history or English class covered by the official program would be a statutory violation. (This would not be a constitutional violation by the parents&#151;only the government can violate the Constitution. The Constitution has been interpreted to permit but not require states to fund religious education as a component of a broad general program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="138">This means that whatever the state statutes say is binding. HSLDA support tax deductions for all educational expenses, similar to deductions for charitable giving or educational tax credits. Both HSLDA's experience and the combined history of our nation and western civilization continually demonstrate that with government funding comes government regulation. HSLDA believes the parent whose child receives related services at the public school is still a home educator. HSLDA may assist homeschool families seeking related services that have been denied because of homeschooling. We view this as a basic fairness issue in that homeschool students in private school states are entitled to related services according to the U.S. Department of Education, but those in homeschool states are not. HSLDA will not assist homeschool students to obtain access to special education in the public school ( see number 6, below, for the reason ).</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">We homeschool our children because we believe it is the best path for their own future and for the impact that they can have on our nation and the generations that follow. Generation Joshua has three main components, each designed to teach homeschooled teens important aspects of civic involvement: (1) civics education, (2) nonpartisan political activity, such as voter registration drives, and (3) active involvement in the campaigns of a few candidates prayerfully selected by HSLDA's board of directors for their character and their positions on issues of importance to our members. The Federal Relations Department supports state homeschooling leaders and HSLDA members by keeping watch and taking quick action on national homeschool issues. We oppose the UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child because it would strip parents of much of their authority to educate, train, and nurture their children according to the dictates of their conscience. In every contact with a social worker/police officer regarding allegations of abuse or neglect, HSLDA provides assistance and advice to our member families. HSLDA has in the past, and may choose in the future, to take cases where there has been a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. You will want to contact your local Red Cross to find out about training and if there are any age stipulations for your area.</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">Generally for membership, we require children under 14 years of age to be supervised. HSLDA reserves the right not to approve any membership application. To date, most charter school programs and all public school independent study programs have been enacted with restrictions regarding religious education. For example, teaching homosexuality as an acceptable alternate lifestyle may well soon become a universal requirement for public schools&#151;including charter schools and public school independent study programs. (See HSF&#146;s home page for more information .) HSLDA's board of directors founded PHC as a college that emphasizes the apprenticeship model of education and will positively impact our culture. The College's distinctives include a deliberate outreach to home schooled students; practical apprenticeship methodology; financial independence; a general education core based on the classical liberal arts; a dedication to mentoring and discipling Christian students; and a community life that promotes virtue, leadership, and strong, life-long commitments to God, family and society.</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">The College's board of trustees is completely separate and distinct from HSLDA's board of directors and the College operates independently of HSLDA. Although Patrick Henry College and HSLDA are separate and distinct organizations, our board's purpose for founding the College remains the same and HSLDA continues to support Patrick Henry College financially and structurally. Specifically, HSLDA donates use of facility space and a portion of revenue earned from interest income to the College. (See also Michael Smith's Washington Times op-ed "A New Generation of Moral Leadership" ) What is HSLDA&#146;s relationship with local and state homeschool organizations? While HSLDA has no official relationship with any local or state homeschool groups, we do provide groups the opportunity to offer HSLDA membership at a discount to their families. Why does HSLDA support efforts to constitutionally define marriage as between a man and a woman?</paragraph><paragraph parID="142">The following answer is an excerpt from a letter written by HSLDA Chairman of the Board and General Counsel Mike Farris: . . . We are a Christian organization (see answer to question number 4 above). This colors our way of thinking about many things. Fundamentally, it is reflected in what we believe is truth. Man's knowledge is limited. We think we know something only to find that future generations have found that we really didn't know what we are talking about. The truth is that God created the family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="143">It is God's view of the family that is reflected in our western civilization and in our law until very recently. If we tear down this God-based view of the family, then all of the God-based principles in our society are ultimately at risk. The reason we have parental rights is because our law assumes that God gave children to parents, not the state. If we eliminate the assumption of God from our law, parental rights and human rights themselves are impossible. I was in the Soviet Union in 1988 arguing for parental rights and religious freedom with the government of the USSR. Only if rights come from God is it illegitimate for man to take another's rights. It is impossible to say that the God of the Bible would sanction rights of homosexual marriage.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">Any man-made theory of rights is no theory at all. While we are actively engaged in public debate regarding homeschooling, we do not seek control of the public discussions surrounding homeschooling. Our communications goal regarding mainstream media is simply to promote, honestly and fairly, the merits of home education, for the good of homeschoolers universally. In order to provide timely information to media on demand, HSLDA has employed a professional director of media relations. In recent years, the media have shown particular interest in our studies on the effectiveness of homeschooling. The hundreds of news stories referring to these studies have been good for all homeschoolers, not just members of HSLDA. Does HSLDA promote exclusively Christian homeschool support organizations?</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">More than 1,000 support groups participate in our group discount program . Religion is not a criterion for participation. What is HSLDA's position on charter schools and public school independent study programs? However, we urge those considering charter schools or public school independent study programs to count the cost, making sure they are fully informed. We understand that the financial pressures faced by families today make publicly subsidized educational programs very attractive. But if accepting government subsidies forfeits your right to teach your children in the way you desire, that price is very high indeed. But even tax deductions would be unacceptable if the mechanisms adopted allow any governmental interference or regulation of content in homeschool programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="146">The price is too high. Related services, on the other hand, are aids to a child&#151;like speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. These services indirectly improve a child&#146;s ability to learn, but are separate from traditional academic curricula. To help our member families equip the next generation for active, effective citizenship, HSLDA founded Generation Joshua in 2004. A division of HSLDA, Generation Joshua provides young people with education on Christian citizenship, and opportunities for young people to receive hands-on training in how our nation's political system operates. Please visit Generation Joshua's website at www.generationjoshua.org . On the federal level, we oppose legislation that would reduce parental freedoms and promote legislation that would increase parental freedoms and strengthen the family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">In representing the best interests of our members, we build consensus with the state leadership before we attempt any legislative initiative in a state. Providing legal advice to non-members requires a commitment on our part without a return commitment on the part of the client. Additionally, on many occasions, the breakup of the marriage comes after the parents joined HSLDA as husband and wife. Consistent with our mission to conserve our resources for helping parents who continue to homeschool, we are not able to extend our advocacy to situations where parents are enrolling their students in public school. Please be aware that this limitation extends to public charter school programs. The Home School Court Report is HSLDA&#146;s bi-monthly membership newsletter. In it, we report important information about new laws and court cases that affect homeschoolers, as well as other information about HSLDA&#146;s activity on behalf of our members and items of interest to the homeschooling community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="148">You may cancel the automatic charges at any time by paying the balance due for the remainder of the current membership year.

For example: If you are paying $10/month (which works out to $120/year), and you have made two payments totaling $20.00, your remaining balance will be $100.00. HSLDA sends out renewal notices approximately six weeks before your membership anniversary date. What is HSLDA&#146;s involvement, if any, in the international growth of home education? Scott currently handles legal issues for HSLDA members in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Maine, Missouri, Iowa, South Dakota and Kansas. He also has extensive previous experience dealing with members' legal issues in Oklahoma, Indiana, Illinois, Colorado, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Michigan.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">In this informative e-vent, HSLDA Senior Counsel Scott Woodruff will explain the basics of homeschooling legally in South Dakota, and will also cover the new alternative instruction form, "tinkering" by the state department of education, and how you can expect to be treated under the new law. You will learn what hours, days, and types of jobs your student can work under Missouri law, as well as whether a work certificate is necessary for a summer job.

Let&#65533;s get this straight: It is legal to homeschool in all fifty states, and the political climate has never been more positive. Some states are very loose, and require little or no tracking of home-schoolers, while some require regular reporting or participation in an ISP (see above). You don&#65533;t want to rely on hearsay, but I strongly suggest that you ask around with other homeschoolers, and contact the homeschooling association in your state well before contacting the authorities. Only when you have a clear picture from a politically-aware association (check the internet) and several fellow homeschoolers, should you make that phone call to the state and fill out the paperwork. Remember that the authorities often have their own strange agendas, which may have more to do with their own funding sources than the law or the welfare of your child. As an example, in California, there is no currently no law whatsoever defining &#65533;homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">If you call the school district, they will tell you that the only way to homeschool legally is through the ISP that they operate. But if you contact the Homeschooling Association of California, they will explain that you can file an affidavit to declare yourself a private school and operate with perfect legality. As you can see, you need to get the straight information from those who are in touch with the ever-changing situation every day. Homeschooling remains legal in California, and California homeschoolers will be filing their private school affidavits between October 1 and 15 as they have for years. They worked for months with the attorneys from HSC and CHEA, to defend our right to continue to homeschool legally in California. In Feburary 2008 this same court issued an opinion that held that California parents can homeschool their children only if they hold a valid teaching credential. Today's court ruling held that (1) California statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education; and (2) the statutory permission to home school may constitutionally be overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared a dependent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="158">Homeschooling, therefore, remains a legal educational option in California. CHN was very concerned about the initial ruling, and is hopeful that the court will recognize that the interpretation of Califorinia law, as understood by homeschoolers for decades, is correct, and that no change in California law regarding the teaching of children privately at home is needed. Homeschooling by using one of the alternatives to public school currently available under California law remains legal. May 19, 2008 California Attorney General Jerry Brown files an amicus curiae brief on behalf of Governor Schwarzenegger supporting the rights of California parents to teach their children at home. April 2, 2008 CHN announced a petition for credentialed teachers in support of homeschooling. "To require a credential for a parent that is home-schooling is ludicrous." "No other state in the country requires a credential," Bertelli said.</paragraph><paragraph parID="159">A statement from the LA County Department of Education "As long as they are a private school registered with the state then as far as we are concerned they are a legal home school," said Victor Thompson, director of student support service for the L.A.

In addition to hearing from the parties on rehearing, the court also invited numerous friends-of-the-court, known as "amicus curiae" to provide legal argument. The court heard argument from the parties and the amicus curiae on June 2, 2008 for more than 2 hours. On February 28th, the court document In re Rachel L. was published. On March 25th, that ruling was vacated, and the California Court of Appeal granted a rehearing, scheduled for June 23, 2008.

We were expecting this to be a closed hearing, but it was open, and members of the press were there. The line was long, waiting to get in the courtroom, and there was some concern that we would not all get in. Those from the state homeschooling groups were really glad when they kept on counting past us, meaning we were going to be allowed to observe the proceeding.

Homeschoolers in California as well as the nation hope that they'll reach a favorable decision."</paragraph><paragraph parID="168">CHN is represented by Baker and McKenzie LLP. All 50 of the United States have mandatory school attendance laws. The children of U.S. military and DoD civilian personnel overseas, however, are not subject to U.S. state mandatory attendance statutes because the children do not reside in any of the 50 states. Nor are the children subject to mandatory attendance laws in foreign countries, because of NATO Status of Forces Agreement. The law which authorizes Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) (20 USC 921 932) is a federal law and does not address mandatory attendance. The implementing directive (DoD Directive 1342.13) for the statute does not require mandatory attendance either. Other U.S. citizens residing overseas (e.g., missionaries), however, are subject to foreign mandatory attendance laws.</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">Legal Problems Faced by Military Families In spite of the advantages of homeschooling in the military, some military officials, especially overseas, have challenged the right to homeschool, and have used excessive restriction or intimidation to deter families from pursuing that course. The Home School Legal Defense Association regularly works on behalf of member families faced with questions or conflicts on military bases. For example, on November 6, 1989, the commander of an Army base in Augsburg, West Germany issued a memorandum (which he later rescinded) condemning homeschooling. Local homeschooling families resisted his memo and the secretary of defense and judge advocates offices were contacted. After these offices reviewed and interpreted the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) Article I, DoDDS statute [20 U.S.C. &#167; 921 932], and DoD Directive 1342.13, they issued the following response: Public education within the United States is a matter which our constitutional system leaves to the discretion of each State.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">Each State, therefore, makes its own laws pertaining to education. These laws are binding on all persons within the State's border, including the dependents of the Department of Defense (DoD) (including the Military Services). The Secretary of Defense does not have the legal authority to issue the kind of regulatory exemption from State education law. The DoD has a specific statutory authority to operate a school for DoD dependents who are assigned overseas. Our statute, unlike the many State statutes which do not apply overseas, does not compel the attendance of any DoD dependent in DoD Dependents Schools. Therefore, a dependent may choose not to enroll in our program (DoDDS) and to elect, instead, an alternative enrollment; for example, a foreign language school, a private school, or in a home schooling program. Our statute imposes no duty on the DoD to finance the cost of any alternate educational benefits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">For these reasons, there is no reason for the Secretary to issue a regulation...regulating home schooling for overseas DoD dependents. A more recent example occurred during the 2007-2008 school year. U.S. military families at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were contacted regarding a new homeschool policy created by the commanding officer of the base. Under the new requirements, the commanding officer would approve home instruction programs, determining whether each had comparable "curriculum content, quantity, and quality to that provided in academic subjects in the same grade level" at Department of Defense schools. Furthermore, homeschool families would have had to establish that they were approved by a governmental agency in the United States. In addition, parents had to demonstrate that they were "capable, by education or experience, of conducting home instruction." The policy also stated:</paragraph><paragraph parID="172">The Commanding Officer may impose requirements for home instruction, including, but not limited to, minimum hours of instruction per day, minimum days of instruction per academic year, records of instruction, inspections, and proof of satisfactory completion of one grade level of home instruction. The commanding officer indicated that any family that did not comply would be forced to return to the States. HSLDA wrote to the base commanding officer explaining that there is no compulsory school attendance law for military dependants overseas. Therefore, there is no basis upon which the commanding officer could enact regulations for parents providing home instruction. HSLDA also explained that the new policy violated the fundamental right of parents to choose how to educate their children as determined by the U.S. Supreme Court. Finally, HSLDA explained that military commanders overseas only have the limited authority to provide free public education, not regulate private education. If a commander believed that there was probable cause of actual neglect of the children's education, he could investigate families only on that basis.</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">We concluded by requesting that the policy be rescinded immediately. The commanding officer responded by eliminating all of the requirements of pre-approval of the homeschool curriculum. He issued a complete revision of the earlier policy. The new policy simply asks the family to notify the commander of the name and age of children who will be homeschooled. No other requirements apply except a statement to "encourage families to maintain records to document educational activities and progress." In summary, military families do have the right to homeschool. If a military homeschool family resides in the United States, it must abide by the state's compulsory attendance law.</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">If the military family lives on foreign soil, however, it is not under the jurisdiction of the foreign country's compulsory attendance law. Nor is it under any regulatory authority of the DoD. Military families, therefore, have no obligation to seek approval of the DoD to homeschool. A family simply needs to secure a curriculum and begin homeschooling. Military Homeschoolers' Access to DoD Academic and Extracurricular Classes HSLDA helped to create a solution for those who want to receive supplemental education services through the DoDDS schools. On November 6, 2002, the DoD issued its new policy, which creates an equal access policy for homeschoolers that does not require homeschooled students to formally enroll in the DoDDS schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">A copy of the DoDEA Policy Memorandum on Home Schooling is located on the DoDEA website. You can also see a copy of the policy on HSLDA's website here. The DoD policy states in part: It is DoDEA policy neither to encourage nor discourage DoD sponsors from home schooling their minor dependents. DoDEA recognizes that home schooling is a sponsor's right and can be a legitimate alternative form of education for the sponsor's dependents.... DoDEA schools will provide and offer home schooled DoD dependents classes and/or special education services, consistent with existing regulations and policy. Dependents of sponsors electing to take a single class or more must complete a registration form and comply with other registry procedures and requirements....</paragraph><paragraph parID="176">For the purposes of use or receipt of auxiliary services without enrolling or registering in DoDDS, a DoD dependent must be eligible for space-required enrollment as specified in DoD Directive 1342.13, "Eligibility Requirements for Education of Minor Dependents in Overseas Areas." For the purposes of use or receipt of auxiliary services without enrolling or registering in DDESS, a DoD dependent must be eligible for tuition free enrollment, as specified in DoD Directive 1342.26, "Eligibility Requirements for Minor Dependents to attend Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS)." Military Homeschool Families in the United States If a military family is homeschooling in the U.S., they need to become familiar with the requirements of the compulsory attendance laws of the state in which they reside. In other words, even though the military has no requirements or jurisdiction over homeschooled children's education, the local public school authorities do. All requirements for home schoolers that have been established by state courts or enacted by state legislatures apply to the military home school families as well.

What is the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA)? Held in Frankfurt, Germany at Goethe University August 15-20, the congress attracted nearly 1,000 academics and legal practitioners.</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">The workshop included presentations by Dr. Thomas Schirrmacher, a German theologian and director of the International Institute for Religious Freedom, and by Michael Donnelly, attorney and director for international affairs at the Homeschool Legal Defense Association. He noted that homeschooling is virtually impossible in Germany because of an aggressive attempt by "legal and sociological machinery" to repress the practice while ignoring regular and rampant truancy among public school children. For the first time in its 50-year history, the World Congress on the Philosophy of Law and Social Philosophy included homeschooling on the agenda of its biannual global conference. Experts in human rights gave papers at a special workshop, organized by Dr. John Warwick Montgomery, noted Christian apologist and distinguished professor of philosophy and Christian thought at Patrick Henry College. "The right of parents a priori to the state to make decisions about how and where their children are educated is a natural right and one that is founded on the basis of holy Scripture. While some governments may choose to regulate or oversee parents who choose this form of education, all governments should tolerate if not encourage it. Montgomery argued that the European Court of Human Rights has missed important opportunities to correctly apply human rights law to the conflict over homeschooling, instead deferring to current societal prejudices and predilections in favor of secular and statist presumptions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">Sadly, this also means that where constitutions and international human rights instruments are silent on an issue, the law will not appeal, as in the past, to the 'higher law' as set out in the holy Scriptures-the inalienable dignity of the human person, his family, and his personal decision-making, as John Locke derived these rights principally from biblical revelation-but will tend to defer to state power and bureaucracy, infused by prevailing pluralistic viewpoints. Schirrmacher argued that the country's federal child protection law that allows the Jugendamt , Germany's child protection service, to take custody of children is being misused when applied to homeschoolers. Schirrmacher points out that compulsory education through school attendance has a long history in Germany, but that the criminalization of homeschooling is a recent issue originating with the rise of national socialism. For the first time, as far as I can see, the principle of compulsory education is expressed in the Weimar School Regulations of 1919. Rather, it was a central and controlling element with which the state educated the population in accordance with its principles. . . national socialism made use of the fact that in any case all children had to learn according to the manner the state prescribed, and thus it merely eliminated free alternatives in private and alternative schools as well as in home educational instruction." Schirrmacher was highly critical of the Germany's use of criminal law to prosecute homeschooling parents. "Modern democratic Germany should not use criminal law against parents who homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="182">HSLDA has reported on numerous cases where the German government persecutes homeschooling parents. That is why HSLDA brought the first-ever homeschool asylum case in 2008 for the Romeike family from Germany. Homeschooling, the Law, Human Rights, and Parental Autonomy." He disagreed with those, like Emory Law Professor and noted child rights advocate Martha Albertson-Fineman, who argued that homeschooling is a problem in a democracy that should "require compulsory public education because only the government can assure the inculcation of values able to ensure the survival of a democratic society." For over a century, compulsory public education has been a "standard" in most developed societies. HSLDA is helping by offering research and advocacy to public policy makers and encouragement to homeschoolers in other countries. State and federal legislators in the republic told Donnelly that most German policy makers are unwilling to credit research gained from America's 40 years of experience with homeschooling and remain fearful that an American approach to homeschooling will create parallel societies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="183">Educational freedom is a foundational right explicitly recognized since 1925 by the United States Supreme Court in Pierce v. Society of Sisters . The fundamental right of parents to direct the education and upbringing of their children has also been incorporated in other documents including the 1945 UN Declaration on Human Rights , the 1950 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms , the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights , and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . Although sovereign nations need to address human rights and freedom issues within the context of their culture and law, organizations like HSLDA that seek to influence public policy both domestically and internationally are needed to speak for the good of all homeschoolers and similarly situated groups.

We believe strongly that God is moving through homeschooling to do much more than provide a quality education for children. In fact, it may be that the most important thing God is doing through the homeschooling movement is to build a better framework in which children can learn about Him.</paragraph><paragraph parID="184">HLA's desire is to be used by God to accomplish His goals for uniting entire families and raising Godly children. Q: Are we allowed to deduct any homeschooling expenses from our taxes? A: To our knowledge this is not being done by other umbrella schools in TN. We've been checking into this for a couple of months and the answer is MAYBE. Being a Category IV school that appoints parents to be teachers is quite different from what the IRS had in mind. And since every individual family has different circumstances we do not feel comfortable giving a blanket YES. HLA operates completely under option three.</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">Therefore, you DO NOT have to register with the local school district for ANY grade level. The problem is the difference in options two and three is very subtle and hinges on the word "associated." Here is the difference. Option 2 (second paragraph reads): "For parents conducting a homeschool which is associated with a church-related school and who are in grades 9-12, parents must register them with the local school district." The key word here is "associated." For all hla teachers: Your "homeschool" is NOT "associated" with a church-related school because you do not HAVE a "homeschool."</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">Option 2 does not apply to you because you are a teacher for HLA and NOT a "homeschooler" under state law. Keep reading to Option 3 (third paragraph). A: Yes. HLA is recognized by and listed with the TN Dept. of Education as a Category IV, church-related school, covered by the provisions of T.C.A. 49-50-801. HLA is also considered a "600" school in Florida . HLA is also a legal covering in CO and IL . , where our families are not considered "homeschoolers" by this state.</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">Therefore, please ask your CPA if you can deduct educational expenses. Thank you. Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) recently sent out a summary of the TN state laws and the three options. The email, which is the three options in paragraph form, is pasted below. We have received several requests for clarification. For example, one parent asked: "I received a letter in the mail from HSLDA and by its wording, it seems like I should register my son, Jonathan, with the local school district since he is entering 9th grade.</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">Is this correct? The letter stated, "for those students whose home school is associated with a church-related school and who are in grades nine through 12, parents must register them with the local school district. " Who should I contact?" The short answer is: Option 3 (third paragraph): HSLDA still believes option three means registration is not necessary for any grade level. Thus this part of the summary: "Parents also have the option of having their children attend a church-related school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">This is not homeschooling, because the church-related school is not being conducted by parents or legal guardians." It is not an association with the church-related school but a complete enrollment with the church-related school. "Under this option, there is no need for parents to comply with the homeschool law, which includes notice, registration, or testing through the public school." This wording directly from the Jeter Memo and the HSLDA website still indicates Option 3 as before . HLA continues to operate under option three and, therefore, does not require, nor believe that, teachers of grades 9-12 must register with the local school district. HomeLife Academy is a state recognized Category IV church-related school. You will be considered a private teacher for HomeLife Academy and not a "homeschooler" under TN state law.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">The TN state board of education has a "home school" program and you may register with the state. However, the church related laws (T.C.A. 49-50-801) read: "The state board of education and the local boards of education are prohibited from regulating the selection of faculty or textbooks or the establishment of a curriculum in church-related schools. " Therefore, we choose YOU to be faculty and we let YOU establish the curriculum. Instead of having our teachers come to a campus and teach someone else's kids, we let you stay home and teach your own. Your home is like an extension of a campus. Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) calls this "option three. " So remember, you are NOT a "home schooler" under law, you are a private school teacher that stays home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">For more on this, read The Jeter Memorandum." Q: What is the difference (in TN) between registering with a CRS and following the Jeter memo? A: The Jeter Memo option is confusing at first. It took me several reviews of this about ten years ago to finally understand. Bottom line is if you choose this optionyou will NOT be "homeschooling." Instead, you will be a private school teacher that stays home. You stay home because your home is a part of our very spread out campus, and your students just happen to be your very own kids!</paragraph><paragraph parID="192">Of course we still use the term home schooling (actually, we prefer home education because we feel there is a significant difference between school and education). In fact the TN Dept. of Education lists us as having a homeschooling program. Even though we do not really have a homeschool program in the purest sense of the church-related laws it just makes things easier for the many superintendents that look up HLA on the non-public schools list. There is a small fine or penalty for not complying with the compulsory schooling requirement. My answer is that while it is an evolving area with no clear precedents in court, and since laws often crystallise from established practice, custom or precedentwe should say it is legal (until clearly declared illegal by either the Monbusho or the courts) because homeschooling activities are being practised, allowed and accepted by authorities in many places. In the past, there have been a few cases of parents who have had to pay that fine in court, so some infer from the mere existence of the fine that homeschooling is illegal. One prefecture's kyoiku inkai (educational authority) has actually publicly sanctioned homeschooling (according to press reports) and will send teachers to the home, you could also infer that that is a very good precedent for considering homeschooling to be legal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">Provided you establish eligibility and are accountable to some local authority for your homeschooling activity. However, while futoko kids who are schooled at home are a generally acceptable situation, the response to homeschooled kids (homeschooled for reasons other than of the kid' refusal to attend school) will vary from case to case, from prefecture to prefecture. It is thus reasonable to say that a homeschooling parent is not in violation of the duty to ensure that the child receives an education if he doesn't send the child to a formal jr or high school. In many courts of law, this is the best principle to argue, and homeschoolers should remember that). However, (as mentioned before) since this generation of majority of Japanese people (lay people or educational officials included) know of no exceptions to formal schooling for middle and high schoolers, and homeschooling is still a relatively unknown phenomenon, many Japanese naturally assume formal schooling is required by law and that homeschooling is illegal. n Japan, the commonest ways in which homeschooling (we know from anecdotes or stories shared by people) has gained acceptance or has been allowed by the authorities occur in the following forms: In some places, authorities have usually allowed homeschooling where the parent says the kids are enroled in a private school, in most cases they have to show some evidence -- sometimes registering with the ward or showing visiting kyoiku inkai and/or school officials, the materials or curriculum used is enough -- sometimes more is required like registration with an umbrella school (some use common homeschooling options from the US, some use a local Japanese institution that "covers homeschoolers" with a diploma from the US, others in Osaka have used UK curricula with legal covering from UK institutions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">-- Another successful way not to fall foul of the authorities is to convince your local public school head that you are homeschooling your kids because of your exceptional circumstances (either you are a bicultural family -- there is an educational by-law that provides exemption for such families; you are planning to send your kids overseas to foreign schools in the near future, etc) this has been often been accepted and has been sufficient for homeschooled children to remain enroled in the local public school, and eventually graduate with a local public school diploma. It is a popular way for homeschoolers to go, because local kyoiku inkai officials generally defer to the local public school officials on such matters, and there will be less bureaucratic interference or home visits; other advantages range from free textbooks, possibilities of even choosing activities in which you can participate in the local school such as kokugo classes, sports, clubs, etc (hence kids are in some measure integrated into the local community). The Tazonos (among others) are one such family who succcessfully negotiated this combination of homeschooling and time in the public school for their son. The Monbusho's recent policies have clearly been in favor of alternative forms of education, other than public schools, such as long-distance correspondence courses; They have also made it clear from White Papers that they want more alternative forms of education for futoko kids as well as that they want MORE parental involvement in children's education (though stopping short of mentioning homeschooling). However, from the history of education once again, we know that national monbusho policies either take time to filter down to implementation by schools, also that there are many schools who regularly ignore any initiatives by the government, and doing things the way they have always done them. So I have mentioned in previous posts, one's success in presenting one's right to homeschool must take into account where the power lies, basically, for homeschoolers -- power lies with those who have the power to deny you that right to homeschool -- usually it will be your local public school head or local ward kyoiku inkai officials. If you wish to homeschool, rather than ignoring the postcard, you must be prepared to "negotiate" with the local public school principal and/or the kyoiku inkai officials how you plan to ensure that your child receives a proper education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">Depending on how "difficult" the authorities in your ward are going to be, this often means you should be able to show clear plans to homeschool, a curriculum and evidence of materials to be used.

What does not vary is HSLDA 's commitment to the constitutional right to teach one's children at home." What are the legal problems homeschoolers face and how does HSLDA attempt to solve them? Many families are contacted by school or government officials questioning the legality of homeschooling.

What are some of the more restrictive states for homeschooling? In a web poll taken by 989 respondents, 49% said religious conviction is the main reason they continue home schooling; 15% positive social environment; 14% academic excellence; 12% specific needs of child; 5% curriculum choice; and 5% flexibility. Is homeschooling legal in all 50 states? "Because the United States Constitution is the highest law of the land, home schooling has always been legal in all 50 states," says Michael Farris. "It has been a bit of a fight to get the various members of the education and social services establishment to accept that fact, but great progress has been made. Currently about two-thirds of the states have specific laws authorizing and regulating home schooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">Warrants were issued for the arrest of Mark and Chris DeJonge, homeschooling parents in Michigan who were homeschooling without a certified teacher. In 1993, the Court ruled that the teacher certification requirement for religious homeschoolers was unconstitutional, transforming Michigan from the worst state in the nation for homeschooling to one of the best. The criminal convictions of the DeJonge family were reversed. HSLDA filed a federal civil rights action, Jeffrey, et al v. O'Donnell, et al, on behalf of nine homeschooling families against 11 oppressive school districts in 1986. In 1988, a U.S. District Court Judge ruled that "the tutorial provision of Pennsylvania Compulsory Attendance Law. . . is unconstitutionally vague" and therefore, unenforceable. In February of 1994, thousands of homeschoolers from across the nation flooded the U.S. House of Representatives with phone calls urging an amendment that protected homeschoolers from a teacher's certification requirement in H.R. 6. An amendment protecting home and private schools was passed overwhelmingly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">The Court ruled in favor of the families and reversed their truancy convictions. HSLDA has also worked successfully to achieve legislative victories by assisting state homeschooling organizations with their legislative goals. In 1989, Governor George A. Skinner signed into law North Dakota's new homeschooling law, which repealed the state's former teacher certification requirement for all teachers. Kansas homeschoolers defeated H.B. 2392 in 1991, which would have required homeschool children to be taught by certified teachers. In Oregon, Governor Barbara Roberts signed into law a bill allowing homeschoolers to participate with public school students in interscholastic activities. Maryland homeschoolers convinced the Maryland Legislature to remove the home visit requirement from the department of education's regulation. In 1993, after making it through the Senate Education Committee with the help of an amendment, H.B. 1260 passed, repealing the South Dakota home visit law.</paragraph><paragraph parID="202">Over the years we have faced fierce or multiple legal conflicts in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, Iowa, Tennessee, New York, Rhode Island, and North Dakota just to name a few. The following states do not require any sort of enrollment notice at all: AL, CT, DE, ID, IL, IN, MI, MO, NJ, OK, SC, TX. All other states (38) require some sort of filing. It may be annual, such as Virginia, or it may be once during the entire course of the home school program, such as Maryland. Fewer than half the states (23) require some sort of assessment or evaluation or progress report. The states which require some sort of assessment are: AR (grades 5,7, 10 only) CO (grades 3,5,7,9 and 11 only), FL, GA, HI, IA, LA, ME, MN, NC, ND (grades 3,4,6,8, and 11 only), NH, NY (grades 9-12 only), OH, OR (grades 3,5,8 and 10 only), PA, SC, SD (grades 2,4,8, and 11 only), TN (grades 5,7, and 9 only), VA, VT, WA, and WV.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">In RI and MA (both of which are "approval" states), local school districts have the option of requiring annual evaluations. In CT, parents must submit work samples to show required subjects were taught, but it is not an evaluation or assessment. The trend is toward removing testing. In the past 7 years, NV, NM and AZ dropped their testing requirements. In these states, families are at risk of prosecution if they homeschool without prior approval of the relevant governmental agency. This is a source of continual friction, anxiety, and misunderstanding since many governmental entities are very lackadaisical about sending approval letters. Of that group, 42 percent said that dissatisfaction with the public school environment (safety, drugs, adverse peer pressure) was their reason for launching a home-education program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">Parents of homeschoolers are, on average, better educated than other parents &#65533; a greater percentage have college degrees &#65533; though their incomes are about the same. Families may choose to purchase a prepackaged curriculum from companies that specifically target homeschoolers, such as A Beka Home School or Saxon Publishers. Others may choose to enroll their children in correspondence programs, like the Calvert School of Maryland, the Christian Liberty Academy Satellite Schools of Illinois, or the Clonlara School of Michigan. Cyber schools, like K-12 Inc., offer an online curriculum for homeschoolers. Tutors may be sought to teach particular skills, such as a foreign language, a musical instrument, or a high-school science class. Homeschooled children also participate in field trips and learning co-ops with other homeschooled students or even take courses at a day school or local college. In 1992, Larry Shyers of the University of Florida defended a doctoral dissertation in which he challenged the notion that youngsters at home "lag" in social development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">In his study, 8- to 10-year-old children were videotaped at play. Their behavior was observed by trained counselors who did not know which children attended conventional schools and which were homeschooled. The study found no significant difference between the two groups of children in self-concept or assertiveness, which was measured by social development tests. But the videotapes showed that youngsters taught at home by their parents had fewer behavior problems. Typically, home schoolers engage in a variety of activities outside the home &#65533; athletics (homeschool sports teams are plentiful), scouting programs, church, community service, or part-time employment. The National Homeschool Association has noted that "homeschooling is legally permitted in all fifty states, but laws and regulations are much more favorable in some states than others." Seasoned veterans encourage homeschooling parents to become familiar with their state's laws before creating a homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">One measure is how well they perform on standardized tests, like the Stanford Achievement Test or the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The National Home Education Research Institute notes, "Repeatedly, across the nation, the home-educated score as well as or better than those in conventional schools." Homeschoolers have graduated from such prestigious institutions as Yale University Law School, the United States Naval Academy, and Mount Holyoke College. J. Gary Knowles of the University of Michigan studied 53 adults to see the long-term effects of being educated at home. In 1991, he presented a paper of his findings at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association in Chicago. Notes Knowles: "I have found no evidence that these adults were even moderately disadvantaged . . . Two thirds of them were married, the norm for adults their age, and none were unemployed or any on any form of welfare assistance. The National Education Association, for instance, regularly passes an anti-homeschooling resolution at its annual convention.</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">Even in a nation that applauds innovation and liberty, the act of homeschooling continues to raise many uncomfortable, but important, questions about government regulation of private choices. Is Homeschooling Legal? For example, Oklahoma is considered friendly toward homeschooling in that parents are not required to initiate contact with state authorities to begin teaching their children at home. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, however, is heavily regulated (approval of curriculum, submission of students' work, etc.). The favorable legal climate does not mean that skirmishes don't occur. Dean Tong, author of Elusive Innocence: Survival Guide for the Falsely Accused (2002), says that a smattering of homeschoolers have had to fight false charges of child abuse. "Based on the phone consultations I've had with (these) homeschoolers, most have been charged in Juvenile-Dependency court with neglect, failure to protect, emotional and psychological abuse, and failure to thrive," reports Tong.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">These bills, drafted by representatives of The Homeschool Legal Defense Association and Representative Marilyn Musgrave are collectively referred to as HONDA, The Homeschool Non-Discrimination Act. As the law currently stands, homeschool graduates under the age of 18 cannot be admitted by a college without jeopardizing a college&#65533;s eligibility to award federal aid to its students because the homeschool graduate does not have a recognized diploma. HONDA ensures that colleges retain their eligibility to award aid by stating that they may admit under-age homeschool students who have finished their homeschool programs, even if they do not have a state-issued diploma The Family Educational Records Privacy Act specifically extends protection of privacy to students who attend public schools. HONDA amends certain provisions of this law so that this protection will be extended to all students, public or non-public. These amendments do not specifically refer to homeschoolers, but state that "for students in non-public education, educational records or personally identifiable information may not be released without the written consent of the parents of such student." The Internal Revenue Code currently allows parents of public, private or religious school students to utilize non-taxable savings accounts for the purpose of funding education related expenses.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">In most states, parents who are homeschooling are not eligible because homeschools are not public, private or religious schools. HONDA redefines &#65533;public, private or religious school&#65533; to include homeschooling. Current law specifies what hours an employed student under the age of sixteen years may work. HONDA extends these specifications in regards to students educated at home. The intention is to allow homeschooled students the option of working during the hours when public school students are not allowed. Concerns regarding HONDA have arisen among some homeschool organizations. These concerns relate to the fact that HONDA is legislation at the federal level and will affect homeschoolers in all fifty states.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">While the bill does allow the definition and management of homeschooling to remain within the authority of the states, some are concerned that HONDA may eventually lead to federal regulation of homeschooling in the future. A statement issued by The Homeschool Legal Defense Association in support of the bills asserts that the amendments in HONDA are necessary to ensure fair treatment of homeschoolers. When these laws were originally drafted, homeschools were overlooked simply because the homeschool movement was still in its infancy. HONDA fixes certain problems pertaining to these laws without jeopardizing homeschooling freedom." Two Congressional bills have been drafted which will impact homeschooling in a variety of ways. H.R. 2732 and SB 1652 are nearly identical and specify five distinct areas in which homeschoolers are currently discriminated against in federal law and which, the authors believe, require minor provisional changes in order to "fix" the problems. These five areas are outlined below:</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">Grants &amp; Student Loans The Higher Education Act of 1965 outlines certain criteria for eligibility for Pell Grants and other financial aid. In 1998 the law was amended so that homeschoolers could become eligible for financial aid. While the amendment updated the eligibility of students, no change was made to institutional eligibility. The authors of HONDA believe this was an oversight that must be corrected. Although the Department of Education is currently attempting to address this issue, several students have already lost their college admission. Family Educational Records Privacy Act</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">Coverdell Educational Savings Account Child Find The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act currently requires public school authorities to locate and assess students who may be in need of special education assistance. HONDA amends certain provisions of this law so that students whose parents do not wish them to be assessed may be exempt. This amendment does not specifically refer to homeschooling but extends these rights to all parents. The Fair Labor Standards Act Despite the benefits this legislation would extend to homeschoolers and other non-public educated students, it is the policy of many homeschool organizations to oppose all legislation that attempts to alter the definition of homeschooling in any way.</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">The publishers of Home Education Magazine recently released a lengthy statement encouraging homeschoolers to oppose HONDA and cited several reasons for their opinion. According to their statement, " These two bills represent the continuation of a dangerous political strategy which abandons the first and best line of defense for homeschooling - the free exercise of rights and responsibilities - in favor of government intervention. This political strategy has unpredictable short term outcomes and fundamental long term consequences." However, according to Tom Washburn, Director of the National Center for Home Education and The Homeschool Legal Defense Association, these concerns are the result of misinformation regarding HONDA. "There is no inherent problem with HONDA," Washburn states. "Federal law already extends protection to homeschoolers. Conversely, a hundred federal laws use generic references to schooling, which could be used as a means for government regulation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">HONDA presents no more opportunity for federal interference than any other law already on the books, and the risk of that happening is minimal." Today there are two million students being homeschooled. According to HSLDA, "their academic success is remarkable. Congress should no longer overlook homeschoolers as a viable and successful movement. Homeschoolers do not want federal handouts, just equal treatment." "HONDA is not so much a homeschooling issue as it is a parental issue," says Washburn. "It is a basic freedom issue.</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">For the most part, homeschooling laws tie back to the state.

This June, Home School Legal Defense Association celebrates a special anniversary: Christopher J. Klicka's 20th year working with the organization to defend and advance homeschool freedoms. Out of the 50 states, only five made legal provision for homeschooling. "I was glad to find someone who was so interested in homeschooling and seemed to know quite a bit about it, even though he didn't have kids," says Farris. "Homeschooling is not a passing fad, but a trend we'll see only grow as the years go by," he predicts. Chris's career has spanned the growth of homeschooling from a small, under-the-radar community to an international movement with legal recognition.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">Throughout his 20 years as an attorney, spokesman, lobbyist, and homeschooling father, Chris has played a crucial role in that growth. March 23, 1990: HSLDA attorney Chris Klicka and other home education advocates testify against regulations proposed by the North Dakota Board of Education. "I've had a bird's-eye view of the homeschool movement since its beginning," comments Chris. Back when he was a newly married law student at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he didn't imagine that his career would soon be devoted to helping parents educate their own children. But he did know that he wanted to serve God through constitutional law. So in the summer of 1984, after his second year in law school, Chris interned for the Rutherford Institute, where his four-month project was to write an analysis of all state laws applying to homeschooling. "I spent endless hours in the Georgetown Law Library poring over the compulsory attendance statutes in all 50 states, poring over all the attorney general opinions that touched on it, poring over all the cases, which were almost all losses," he remembers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">As the project blossomed into a 300-page analysis, Chris began to see homeschooling's personal side. "I talked to every homeschooler who called the Rutherford Institute asking for legal advice," he says. "So I began to see and hear their religious convictions and the call on their life. I talked to my wife Tracy and said, 'This is what I want to do&#151;teach our future children at home.'" He adds, "That's where I feel my calling has always been, ever since I was in law school: God wants me to help families so that they can teach their children His ways in their own homes." As Chris finished up his law degree, he applied to work at several organizations where he knew he could be involved in First Amendment cases. One resume went to Concerned Women for America, whose executive director was a young lawyer named Michael Farris.</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">Unbeknownst to Chris, Farris had co-founded Home School Legal Defense Association with J. Michael Smith two years before, in 1983. "I got a call back from Mike Farris and he said, 'This is too good to be true.'" Chris started working for HSLDA in June of 1985, and that August, he became HSLDA's first full-time attorney. Whether on the phone with an aggressive social worker or on a live radio broadcast, Chris Klicka is always ready to speak up on behalf of homeschooling freedom. "Those first 10 years were very intense," Chris recalls. "Those cases were really weighty, because if we lost them, people wouldn't be able to homeschool in the whole state. And many of the cases HSLDA worked on were not winners in the beginning."</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">For instance, a few months before Chris began working for HSLDA, Michigan members Mark and Chris DeJonge were charged with criminal truancy for homeschooling without a certified teacher. It would take eight years for the case to work its way from the trial court through the appeal system to ultimate victory at the state supreme court level&#151;a victory that earned an exemption from the certification requirement for all homeschoolers in the state. "When we think of Chris, the first thing that comes to mind is the personal, spiritual impact he has had in our lives," say Dennis and Roxanne Smith, who cofounded Information Network for Christian Homes in 1984. Dennis now directs the Michigan organization. When we think of what Chris has done for the homeschoolers in Michigan, we think 'freedom.' . . . We now have one of, if not the best, homeschooling laws in the nation." "I'd sometimes get pretty down when I saw these lower courts' decisions coming against us," Chris says, "but God was teaching me to trust Him.</paragraph><paragraph parID="220">Little did I know that that would serve me well with all the legislation, because sometimes we had to come back year after year after year till finally we'd get the bill passed. June 2004: Chris and Tracy Klicka enjoy a field trip to the Colorado Rockies with their seven homeschooled children. As Chris, Tracy, and their children (they now have seven, ages 7-17) began to deal with the effects of his disease, the legal climate of homeschooling began to change, too. "The first 10 years, we were fighting for the right to exist," says Chris. "For the past 10, we've been fighting for the right to be less regulated." While homeschooling freedoms in the United States became more secure, Chris became more involved in international homeschooling. Over the years, he has alerted U.S. homeschoolers to threats against home education in a number of countries, such as the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">(A flood of emails from HSLDA members literally shut down the Czech Parliament's server!) He has also helped parents in Canada, South Africa, Germany, and Japan launch their own legal defense organizations. After a five-year stint as executive director of HSLDA's National Center for Home Education, Chris returned to HSLDA's legal department in 2000. "A lot of our work is just day-to-day convincing local school districts that they're wrong: writing letters, showing them that we're willing to stand up and fight for these families, educating the educators," says Chris. "My job is to keep these situations from going to the litigation department!" In 2004, he was honored with Calvert School's Homeschooling's Best Award for Lifetime Achievement because of his work in three areas: passing legislation in several states that requires social workers to be trained in the constitutional rights of parents, negotiating with the Department of Defense to obtain fair treatment for homeschooled recruits, and effecting changes in New York's college admission policies to end discrimination against homeschoolers. January 26, 2005: Chris Klicka receives the Homeschooling's Best Lifetime Achievement Award from Jean C. Halle, President of Calvert School Education Services.</paragraph><paragraph parID="222">Over the past two decades, Chris has seen homeschooling become clearly legal in every state. Homeschool associations have formed across the country and HSLDA's membership has expanded from 1,200 to more than 80,000. "When we started working with Home School Legal Defense Association, we thought we would work ourselves out of business as we won the right to homeschool in the legislatures and courts," recalls Chris. "But we've realized gaining the right to homeschool was just the first step&#151;now we have to preserve that right. If we let down our guard and no longer call the legislature in regards to bad legislation, or fail to stand with groups like HSLDA and the state homeschool organizations, the enemy of homeschool freedoms will prevail once again." Jim Werner, Founder and Chairman of Circle Christian School, a homeschool organization in Florida, says, "Chris Klicka has had a profound impact on the homeschooling movement. Legal Issues Related to Homeschooling</paragraph><paragraph parID="223">In an attempt to help visitors to find information related to the legal issues associated with home schooling the following links to information that are located outside the confines this website have been provided. Legal Summary of Homeschooling in Michigan The most valuable, up-to-date and accurate information concerning home schooling in Michigan can be found at the Home School Legal Defense Association ( HSLDA ) web site. Michigan Department of Education Home Schooling Information Michigan Graduation Requirements Information concerning the current Michigan Department of Education requirements for graduation. Home page for high school graduation, which mainly pertains to the upcoming Michigan requirements for graduation (Michigan Merit Curriculum FAQ page ), with one set of changes for students entering 8th grade in 2006 and an additional change for students entering 3rd grade in 2006 .</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">While homeschooling was not even a blip on most people's radar screen, Chris completed a 300-page analysis of homeschooling laws in the 50 states. In 1985, when I joined HSLDA, we had approximately 1500-2000 member families. My job was to protect those families when we had only about five states where it was clearly legal to homeschool. He soon found himself president of that group, and then was chosen as the president of Christian Educators of New Hampshire in 1988, an organization that was formed for the sole purpose of keeping the New Hampshire Department of Education from tripling the regulations on homeschoolers. When HSLDA members encounter problems with school officials or social workers, they should notify their state attorney immediately. Many of homeschooling's past battles resulted from the lack of state statutes and case law that specifically allowed for homeschooling. 1 In 1989, HSLDA filed Lawrence v. State Board of Education to challenge South Carolina's requirement that homeschooling parents without a college degree take the state's Educational Entrance Examination (EEE).</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in favor of homeschool freedom on December 9, 1991. For twenty years, Home School Legal Defense Association has had one simple focus: defending and protecting homeschooling families, regardless of the cost. During the week of January 20-24, 2003, HSLDA President Mike Smith produced a series of programs for Home School Heartbeat entitled "Vocation: Instilling a Sense of God's Calling." Never in the history of HSLDA. THE PAST: THE PATH TO HSLDA "When I was a student in law school," Christopher Klicka recalls, "God put a desire in my heart to defend Christian families, especially in the area of government's attempts to restrict religious freedom." Upon graduating from law school, Chris applied to a number of constitutional law firms, including Concerned Women for America, where Mike Farris, as then-General Counsel, was involved in many religious freedom battles. Mike, intrigued by Chris' knowledge of homeschooling laws, called Chris for an interview.</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">In 1985 Chris, a newlywed with no children, became the first full-time attorney and employee of the Home School Legal Defense Association. We also began our practice of sending out alerts&#65533;in those days we used phone trees. And, little by little, God showed Himself strong on behalf of the homeschoolers. The legal climate in South Carolina was becoming more and more hostile for homeschoolers: a number of cases were being filed against and on behalf of homeschooling families. Mike Farris did call Dee and Dee began to serve as local counsel for HSLDA for some of the South Carolina cases. During a conversation the first day of trial, Mike Smith and Mike Farris approached Dee about the possibility of working with HSLDA on a fulltime basis. Scott spent seven months as a computer programmer and ordinary dad trying to stop a committee of 11 people from increasing the regulations on homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="227">When I got out of Harvard, I asked the attorneys at HSLDA for some recommendations for Christian lawyers around the country who might be interested in a person like me, and much to my amazement, was offered a job at HSLDA. I came to HSLDA in September of 1998. THE PRESENT: CURRENT RESPONSIBILITIES AT HSLDA According to Scott (Somerville), HSLDA has two very busy seasons: "the fall when all the truant agents come out and the period from January to March or April when the legislatures are in session." Scott reiterates, "My favorite part of the job is not dealing with senators or judges, but it is helping individual homeschool families." In spite of the fact that homeschooling is now legal in all 50 states, prejudices against homeschooling remain, and HSLDA resolves as many as 8,000 conflicts a year for their member families. Dee offers this insight: "There are only a very small percentage of instances where we're not able to take care of the problem before it goes to court. In most cases when families are forced into court, they have not contacted us early enough to enable us to deal with the problem on their behalf.</paragraph><paragraph parID="228">It's not just the parents' fault&#65533;often school officials do not allow us time to work out a resolution before they initiate court action." According to Chris, Our battles now are against misapplications of the law, against authorities who are prejudiced, and against social workers who take anonymous tips. These anonymous tips are often from family members and people who don't like homeschoolers. They call a child-abuse hotline, often fabricating a story about a homeschooling family. Next thing you know a social worker is at the door demanding entry and demanding to interrogate each of the children separately. We work to prevent this from happening.</paragraph><paragraph parID="229">We call it "The Battle for the Front Door." Scott (Woodruff) understands well the Battle for the Front Door and the turmoil that Christian parents face. If an official comes to my door and asks for something that is not his due, I have the right, perhaps even the duty, to tell him "no." If a police officer comes to my door and wants to interview my child and does not have a court order, generally he is not entitled to access to my child. The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution guarantees every citizen protection from unwarranted government intrusions into their home. Parents must understand that issue clearly. Because the social worker or police offers is not entitled to what he is asking, we can scripturally, with total confidence, tell him "no."</paragraph><paragraph parID="230">THE FUTURE: FOR HOME-SCHOOLING PARENTS &amp; CHILDREN HSLDA will continue steadfastly in its mission to help homeschooling parents. In regard to our children, Dee has witnessed the fruit of homeschooling as he has observed the many homeschooled graduates who have worked at HSLDA in various capacities over the years. Our lawyers are all homeschooling fathers, who have 57 years of combined legal experience defending homeschool families. Over 20 homeschool graduates work for us in various staff positions. We are committed to home education, not only as a legal right, but also as an educational opportunity and spiritual blessing. We are a Christian organization that advocates the right of all families to homeschool regardless of their religious affiliation. We believe God has blessed HSLDA 's efforts on behalf of the homeschooling community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="231">Your Advocates for Family &amp; Freedom In the Court Room Every parent has the right to homeschool. HSLDA is committed to advocating the two fundamental principles of this liberty: parental rights and religious freedom. Since 1983, we have represented our member families every step of the way-from consultation to correspondence and negotiation with local officials, and in court proceedings all the way through the appellate courts. HSLDA pays all litigation costs for homeschool cases it undertakes. A Voice in Washington, DC HSLDA monitors federal legislation and maintains relationships with key Senate and House offices as well as with other family-friendly organizations through the National Center for Home Education. Founded by HSLDA 's board of directors in 1990, the National Center for Home Education also directs the Congressional Action Program (CAP). A two-pronged effort, CAP trains DC area homeschool families to lobby our federal representatives on issues affecting home educators and disseminates emergency legislative alerts to volunteers nationwide by fax and e-mail.</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">At the invitation of state homeschool organizations, HSLDA assists with drafting statutes to improve their homeschool legal environment. A Positive Image in the Media HSLDA strives to present an engaging, informative, and dynamic picture of the homeschooling community to the public by providing the media with articulate and knowledgeable spokesmen on the subject of homeschooling. Our press releases alert the media to significant court decisions, research findings, or achievements by homeschooled students, and articles authored by HSLDA s taff are published in newspapers and magazines across the country.

How many homeschoolers are there nationwide? Today an estimated 1.6-2.0 million children are being taught at home by their parents. - Brian Ray, Worldwide Guide to Homeschooling, Broadman &amp;amp; Holman, 2002, p.7. The number of families choosing to home school grows at an estimated annual rate of 7-15 percent. - Ray, pg.

Hundreds have ended up in court or administrative hearings. For example: After being found guilty by lower courts, the DeJonges' case was eventually appealed to the Michigan Supreme Court. As a result of this victory, over twenty cases in court against HSLDA were won or dismissed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="237">The Lund and Reimche families in North Dakota were tried and convicted for the crime of homeschooling their children.

According to Chris, "We have never yet had a family whose homeschool had to be shut down or was shut down by the government. Christopher J. Klicka, Esq.Senior Counsel for HSLDA, Director of State &amp; International Relations      Directs legal department and international outreach. They have the responsibility of resolving legal difficulties for families in their respective states; and, in many instances, they also work alongside state leaders in the legislative arena. This desire gave birth to a legal internship at the Rutherford Institute during the summer of 1984. To understand what is due, most parents need legal advice, because what is due is almost always a legal issue. I also have an opportunity to keep reminding them that ultimately it is God, not me as a lawyer, or even the legal system that is going to protect them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="239">These young people are amazing to me in their level of spiritual development, their commitment to God's ways, and their serious-mindedness about things in life . . . I see the next generation of homeschooling families being those who themselves have been homeschooled. One such case, involving Michigan HSLDA members Mark and Chris DeJonge, spanned eight years and resulted in a landmark decision in the state supreme court, which led to an exemption for homeschoolers from teacher certification requirements. It is with a mixture of sadness and joy that Home School Legal Defense Association reports the homegoing of our co-laborer Christopher J. Klicka. A longtime champion of homeschooling rights around the globe, HSLDA Senior Counsel and Director of State and International Relations Chris Klicka was called home by his Lord on October 12, 2009, at age 48, following a 15-year battle with multiple sclerosis. An attorney, spokesman, lobbyist, and homeschooling husband and father, Chris is survived by his wife, Tracy, and their seven children-Bethany Arnoldbik (21), Megan (18), Jesse (17), Susannah (15), Charity (14), Amy (14), and John (11)-along with Chris's parents, Ardath and George Klicka. Chris was born on April 2, 1961, in Wisconsin and went on to earn a BA from Grove City College in Pennsylvania in 1982 and a Juris Doctorate from O.W. Coburn School of Law, Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1985. When Chris came to work for HSLDA in 1985 as its executive director and first full-time employee, he did everything -answered the phone, opened the mail, gave legal counsel, processed membership applications, filed records, and wrote and edited the newsletter.</paragraph><paragraph parID="240">"He was dedicated to communicating with and educating members," says Smith. Although in those days the graphics were more limited and photos were harder to obtain, Chris filled the pages of the Court Report with stories of families courageously standing for homeschool freedom, with news of good and bad bills pending in the legislatures, and with in-depth explanations of educational issues and governmental principles. As HSLDA grew and Chris was able to focus more on legal work, he often worked late into the night dictating replies to members, letters to aggressive school superintendents, and more articles for the Court Report . Two years into law school, Chris's interest in serving the Lord through constitutional law landed him an internship with the Rutherford Institute in 1984, where he was assigned to analyze the homeschool laws of all 50 states. The results looked rather bleak: only 5 out of the 50 states made legal provision for homeschooling. But, as homeschooling parents who called the Rutherford Institute for legal assistance shared their religious conviction and strong sense of calling, Chris became persuaded that this daring, barely legal educational option was the best form of education-it was the right choice. Even though he and his wife, Tracy, didn't have children yet, they knew that their children would be homeschooled.</paragraph><paragraph parID="241">After finishing his law degree, Chris applied for work at several organizations, targeting those which would enable him to tackle First Amendment cases. Following an interview with Concerned Women for America's then-executive director Michael Farris, Chris received a phone call that took him by surprise. It turned out that two years earlier, Mike Farris had co-founded Home School Legal Defense Association with J. Michael Smith. Whether their right to homeschool was threatened by prosecutors, social workers, or truant officers, Chris was ready to make a phone call, write a letter or email, provide counsel, or even represent the family in court. His advocacy did not stop at the courtroom. He testified on behalf of homeschool freedom before numerous state legislatures and the United States Congress. He even helped homeschoolers in South Africa, Kenya, Germany, the Czech Republic, Mexico, Canada, and other foreign nations begin homeschooling and establish a strong legislative and legal defense.</paragraph><paragraph parID="242">In addition to penning five books on homeschooling and several pamphlets on Christian living, Chris wrote numerous articles for the Home School Court Report , the Teaching Home , Practical Homeschooling , and many other periodicals. Slowly, homeschooling became legal. Today, Michigan boasts one of the best homeschool laws in the nation. Through these sometimes discouraging cases, Chris realized that God was teaching him trust and perseverance, qualities that he would need to help push through improved homeschool legislation in many states, year after year after year until the bill finally passed. As Chris and his family faced the effects of MS, the legal climate of homeschooling transitioned from a battle for the right to exist to a struggle for the right to be less regulated. Homeschool freedoms in the United States had become more secure-it was clearly legal in every state. State homeschool associations had formed across the country, and HSLDA's membership had expanded from 1,200 to more than 40,000.</paragraph><paragraph parID="243">(HSLDA membership would more than double to 86,000 families by 2009.) At this juncture in the mid 1990s, Chris began more actively working to expand homeschooling awareness and freedoms internationally. He helped needy families connect with curriculum providers, alerted U.S. homeschoolers to letter-writing campaigns on behalf of home education in many countries, and helped parents in Canada, South Africa, Germany, and Japan launch legal defense organizations. On June 11, 1998, Chris testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families. He did all of this while maintaining a full workload, primarily in HSLDA's legal department, but with six years as the director of HSLDA's National Center for Home Education (now the federal relations department). In the legal department, his goal was to keep everyday misunderstandings and conflicts from escalating to the level of litigation. At the National Center, he helped draft federal legislation, lobbied on Capitol Hill, and offered expert testimony before several congressional committees.</paragraph><paragraph parID="244">"No trip was too far for Chris. No legislative challenge was too big. In 2000, Chris returned to HSLDA's legal department, this time as its director. HSLDA continued growing, and now he was supervising several other contact attorneys and four legal assistants in a busy schedule. Under his leadership, the staff responded to member requests, interfaced with government officials who were purposely or naively treading on homeschooling families' freedom, worked with state homeschooling organizations to monitor and lobby on homeschooling bills in all 50 state legislatures, and spoke at state homeschooling conferences to educate homeschoolers on the law. Chris provided then Minnesota Senator Rod Grams with a packet on homeschooling issues during HSLDA's leaders summit in 1998. Just improving and maintaining homeschooling's legal status wasn't enough for Chris, though.</paragraph><paragraph parID="245">He knew there were still areas of American society where homeschooling was so misunderstood that it would hurt home educated students as they went on to compete in sports, seek employment, apply to colleges, request financial aid, or enter the military. Chris personally pursued face-to-face meetings with decision-making officials in each area, resulting in changed national policies that evened the playing field for all homeschooling students. He even pursued federal legislation requiring states to implement training for social workers in citizens' 4th Amendment constitutional rights. One of the last things Chris did for HSLDA during this time was a webinar in which he spoke from his heart about why it is important to homeschool and to keep going despite the difficulties. In the video, it is evident that Chris's illness was taking its toll, but we are so glad to have this final message to encourage homeschoolers going through hard times.

Registered homeschooling is one of the exemption categories along with large families (four or more children aged between 6 and 16), parents caring for foster children and children with significant disabilities. This formalises an arrangement whereby home educating families negotiate partial enrolment with a school in order to access certain subjects. The Education and Training Reform Act 2006, came into effect in Victoria on 1st July 2007.

They help each other network and they support each other's activities. Support groups provide a fertile soil for lending a helping hand to new homeschoolers, for providing love and support to veteran homeschoolers, and for providing social events and field-trip opportunities for homeschooled students. State organizations often help new homeschoolers plug into local support groups. State organizations have played essential roles in the amazing political, legal, and PR successes of the modern homeschooling movement. After working in the homeschooling movement for 18 years, I've found that the state homeschool associations are crucial for maintaining the freedom to homeschool in each state. Lobbying and legislative activities "State homeschool organizations are vitally important to maintaining a favorable legal climate for home instruction.</paragraph><paragraph parID="250">The stronger the state organization, the safer it is for home educators. Today, state organizations continue to serve as watchdogs in their respective state legislatures. They employ a legislative monitoring service that alerts state leaders to legislation that should be examined and observed-complimenting the state organization's own monitoring procedures. In spite of the important role state homeschooling organizations play in the continued growth and well-being of the homeschooling movement, "Serving Homeschoolers at the State Level: Current Perceptions," a recent survey conducted by Thomas W. Washburne, Esq., Director of HSLDA's National Center for Home Education, concludes the following: In fact, many state homeschooling organizations were organized in the 1980s and early 1990s to fight bad homeschooling laws and to help draft and implement favorable legislation. These years were marked with intense legal and legislative battles. Secondly, HSLDA attorneys are available to state leaders to aid in the process of defeating harmful legislation, while helping with the implementation of positive legislative change.</paragraph><paragraph parID="251">During the 2002 legislative session, homeschoolers in South Carolina were blindsided by a bill that threatened to nullify the diplomas earned by homeschooled graduates. This bill had the potential to prohibit homeschool graduates from attending state colleges, holding state jobs, or running for state office. To strengthen their overall legislative presence, many state organizations host legislative days at their state capitols for both homeschooling parents and children. Claiborne and Lana Thornton, board members for the Tennessee Home Education Association, have been organizing the annual Capitol Hill Rally and Legislative Reception Day for years. Regarding the legislative work of state organizations, Chris Klicka issues this clarion call: "State organizations cannot effectively lobby on behalf of and serve homeschoolers unless individuals support them." Kim agrees with Susan Beatty on the importance of providing an opportunity for fellowship through state conventions: "By being able to listen to speakers and talk to other homeschooling families (even after 20 years of homeschooling), I come back rejuvenated with a new vision for what God has for our family and what God has for homeschooling in general." Many state organizations have developed sophisticated websites that provide invaluable information on getting started, timely updates on legislative issues, and helpful information on general homeschooling topics.</paragraph><paragraph parID="252">As we have already discussed, these organizations help new homeschoolers get started; they host inspirational and informative workshops and conventions; they invest countless hours in creating beneficial newsletters and publications; and they guard our liberties through legislative monitoring and effective lobbying. As the homeschooling movement matures, many older women are working through their state organizations as a way to fulfill the Titus 2 mandate to "encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, &#65533; and to be workers at home" (Titus 2:4-5).

Descriptors: Elementary Secondary Education, Home Schooling, Nontraditional Education, Parents as Teachers, State Regulation But by the beginning of the twentieth century, schools had become commonplace and states had adopted compulsory school attendance laws. Gradually, state by state, the legislature, a state court, an attorney general, or a state board made homeschooling legal. This Digest discusses the extent of contemporary homeschooling and its legal status, describes available resources, presents evidence on the performance of homeschoolers, and notes how public opinion regarding the practice has changed over time. WHAT IS THE LEGAL STATUS OF HOMESCHOOLING? Today homeschooling is legal in all states.</paragraph><paragraph parID="254">State law generally requires homeschooling parents to file basic information with either the state or local education agency. Over half the states require some kind of evaluation under some or all of the homeschooling options available under state law. The United States Supreme Court has not explicitly ruled on homeschooling, though it is clear that reasonable regulations will be allowed. The Court has found constitutional problems with compulsory school requirements in Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972), a limited decision involving the Amish. Yoder has led some lower courts to extend more protection to homeschooling families with a religious orientation, compared with those with a secular orientation. Some state statutes mandate that local districts provide access for homeschoolers desiring to utilize curricular and extracurricular programs. Iowa mandates access to special-education programs for eligible homeschooling children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="255">Only a few states allowed homeschooling as an exception to the attendance requirement. As a result, homeschoolers risked fines or jail sentences in most states. A lucky few lived in jurisdictions that would not prosecute homes schoolers. However, homeschoolers are more likely to be religious, conservative, white, better educated, and part of a two-parent family, compared with the average American family. Homeschooling families tend to have more children and be middle-class (Bielick and others 2001; Henke and others 2000; Rudner 1999). Parents who homeschool their children are more likely to vote, contribute money to political causes, contact elected officials about their views, attend public meetings or rallies, or join community and volunteer associations (Smith and Sikkink 1999). Usually, this evaluation involves testing of students, but some states accept portfolio evaluations or a teacher evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="256">Much less frequently, states have education or testing requirements for parents. Some states require submission of a curricular plan. Parents do not need teaching certificates. A new source of legal tension has emerged over requests for part-time access to public school curricular or extracurricular programs. Much depends on the state's legal and policy environment. Maine, for example, broadly mandates such access. Alaska sponsors the Alyeska Central School, where teachers in Juneau work with students all over the state via mail, the Internet, telephone, and occasional home visits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="257">In California, children can enroll in a public school's independent study program. Washington and Iowa laws require public schools to admit students part-time. Some public schools offer specialized homeschooling centers where families may obtain resources and instructional support, or where children may take classes (Hardy 2001; Lines 2000b). I am not a lawyer, so it is up to you to verify and interpret the homeschool laws. I provide them for your information only, and rely on the help of homeschoolers in the geographic areas to assist me in keeping these laws as correct as possible.

With a large number of homeschooling families joined together, the HSLDA can provide a low-cost solution to obtaining legal defense to families whose freedom to homeschool has been threatened.</paragraph><paragraph parID="269">Once joining the HSLDA there are no further costs for defending homeschool families in court. The HSLDA also defends families' rights to homeschool in state legislatures, advocates on Capitol Hill, and in the media. HSLDA has a terrific website that keeps homeschool families current on legal issues around the country, legislation that is being introduced and passed, as well as issues that face homeschooling families around the world. The HSLDA has a list of legal requirements for every state so that you know exactly what you need to do to legally homeschool your children. Along with this is a list of state laws, organizations, cases, legislation, headlines, and member resources regarding each individual state. Also offered on the HSLDA website is valuable information regarding homeschooling your teenager.

HSLDA worked with dedicated state leaders to make home education safe and legal. Homeschooling families across the country know from experience that HSLDA is more than just a law firm. It is a group of dedicated attorneys and staff members who share a common vision of homeschool freedom, educational excellence, and the protection of individual families. Long-term commitment On February 20, 1989, homeschoolers flooded the offices of North Dakota legislators with hundreds of tea bags with the attached message: "The consent of the governed for home schooling, too!" It would be another two years before the first permanent homeschool law in North Dakota was passed&#151;a culmination of half a decade of collaboration between state homeschoolers and HSLDA. "If you talk to Mike Farris, he'll tell you a lot about North Dakota, because he spent a lot of time here," says Gail Biby, Executive Secretary of the North Dakota Home School Association (NDHSA).</paragraph><paragraph parID="271">Dr. Raymond Larsen, who is currently chairman of our board, was charged with violating the state's compulsory attendance laws. HSLDA attorneys handled this early case and fought continuous court battles up until 1993. "It wasn't until 1989 that we got our first temporary homeschooling law passed in North Dakota. But in 1991 our first permanent law passed. Before the current law was passed in 1988, it was up to each school district to decide what they would require of homeschooling parents. Our particular school district required parents to have a teaching certificate in order to homeschool. "This was overturned when HSLDA took a school district to court, and eventually the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled that the Pennsylvania homeschooling statute was unconstitutionally vague.</paragraph><paragraph parID="272">They knew that HSLDA was there, that they could join and have protection, in the event they did get taken to court. Homeschoolers have frequently been faced with unnecessary demands, such as unannounced home visits and severe testing requirements. State-by-state legislation In 1988, Colorado homeschoolers began writing their state's first homeschool law. "He wrote one of the key amendments in the law pertaining to record keeping, which has proven over and over to be a tremendous service to families. "In 1994, when we worked on the major upgrade to our law, Chris came out and testified for us. HSLDA hosts the National Home School Leadership Summit every other year in Washington, DC, to give state leaders a chance to dialogue and keep informed of trends in homeschooling related legislation. Competent counsel, Christian worldview Kent Vincent has been the Legislative Liaison for Christian Home Educators Confederation of Kansas (CHECK) since its inception about 12 years ago.</paragraph><paragraph parID="273">With the advent of HSLDA in 1983, we had an organization that would back these families financially (in terms of legal assistance). In addition to the financial aspect, HSLDA has provided that rare blend of competent legal counsel with a Christian worldview. Sometimes that means fighting legal and legislative battles. HSLDA attorneys stand in the gap by praying for and with families, counseling them, and dealing with government officials who step outside the law: police officers, social workers, school officials, and truancy officers. As Home School Legal Defense Association celebrates 20 years of serving homeschoolers, both members and non-members alike can testify to its impact on their homes and communities. In this article, members of the homeschool community from across the country share what HSLDA has meant to them over the past 20 years. The "Bismarck Tea Party" expressed homeschoolers' frustration with years of unfair treatment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="274">"Our law was tampered with during every successive legislative session&#151;1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003. We had one issue arise recently in North Dakota over state assessment testing. Dewitt Black came to our state in February and testified in a Senate Education Committee meeting, and the bill was withdrawn." Dr. Bruce Eagleson, Chairman of the Board for the Alliance of Christian Home Education Leadership and Vice-Chairman of the Christian Homeschool Association of Pennsylvania (CHAP), tells a similar story about the drawn-out battle for the right to homeschool in Pennsylvania: That very decision allowed Pennsylvania to pass a law that, although complex, is understandable and do-able." Empowered through security Michigan, home of the DeJonge case, was a hotbed of legal activity from the earliest days of HSLDA's history. Confidence to persevere Massachusetts, a small state with a large population, contains about 300 school districts, each of which is autonomous in what it requires of homeschooling families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="275">"In Massachusetts, each district superintendent is a law unto himself," explains Beverly Somogie. "Mike Farris came years ago and argued the Brunelle case; from that case homeschooling has gained a very positive image. The judges ruled very favorably for homeschoolers and basically said, 'Leave these families alone. "We've had five different superintendents in our town while we've been homeschooling. Each time there was a change, we had to have a meeting with the new superintendent. The last superintendent wanted us to meet with the principal of each school our children would be attending. We have four children and at that time they were in elementary, middle, and high school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="276">The first year we did meet with all the principals out of courtesy. We educated the educators about homeschooling. We've met with these people. She got very adamant about our compliance. Scott Somerville, HSLDA attorney and Harvard law graduate, wrote her a letter, and that was the end of that. A national presence Mary Ann Eagleson, CHAP board member, gleans support and valuable information from the National Homeschool Leadership Summit, hosted every other year in Washington, DC, by the National Center for Home Education, a division of HSLDA. That has been invaluable in assisting families in their various problems with regard to our vague law here in Kansas.</paragraph><paragraph parID="277">I've been able to work with Chris Klicka, David Gordon, Scott Somerville, and Scott Woodruff, and now Jim Mason. All have been true gentlemen. They've all been helpful and very reassuring for these families who face uncertainties in Kansas. They have been a tremendous backstop in that whole system. Besides all that, they're just tremendous individuals. We've really appreciated getting to know them not only in these legal matters and legislative issues, but also at some of the homeschooling conferences. Susan Beatty, 1982 co-founder and current Communications Director of the Christian Home Educators Association of California, adds:</paragraph><paragraph parID="278">HSLDA's significance to homeschooling worldwide lies within the dedicated men who launched and guided the organization. The dynamic yet oftentimes gentle presence and leadership of J. Michael Smith has given thousands of California homeschooling parents the courage to continue. In spite of moving from California to HSLDA headquarters in Virginia, Mike Smith remains 'our attorney' in the hearts of Californians. Conclusion Throughout its 20-year history, HSLDA has sought to effectively minister to the varied needs of homeschooling families. Other times that means the day-by-day coaching of families facing difficulties. On occasion, HSLDA will handle precedent-setting cases for nonmembers, as well. HSLDA advocates on Capitol Hill by tracking federal legislation that affects homeschooling and parental rights.</paragraph><paragraph parID="279">HSLDA works to defeat or amend harmful bills, but also works proactively, introducing legislation to protect and preserve family freedoms. HSLDA advocates in the media by presenting articulate and knowledgeable spokesmen to the press on the subject of homeschooling. HSLDA staff members are regularly called upon for radio, television, and print interviews, and their writings are frequently published in newspapers and magazines across the country.

Can homeschooled children obtain work permits? Yes. How would it work for homeschooling parents have an additional administrator to issue permits? Nothing in the law prohibits a private school from adding new administrators at any time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="283">work permits are not needed for minors who are self-employed, work permits are not needed for minors working in agricultural or domestic jobs where their parents own, operate, or control the business. Will all private and public schools issue the work permits? Under the new law, if a student's school does not issue permits, the student may obtain a permit from one of the following sources: the superintendent of the school district in which the student resides, or any work experience education teacher or person who holds a services credential with a specialization in pupil personnel services, so long as the person issuing the permit has written authorization by the school district superintendent to issue permits. If the student lives in an area not covered by a school district, and if the student does not attend a charter school, he may obtain a permit from one of these sources:</paragraph><paragraph parID="284">the county superintendent of schools, or any certificated work experience education teacher or coordinator, or any person who holds a services credential with a specialization in pupil personnel services, so long as the person issuing the permit is authorized by the county superintendent of schools in writing. However, since parents cannot issue work permits to their own children, homeschooled students must get permits from an administrator other than their own parents. In the case of a homeschooled student who is enrolled in a public school program, including a charter school, the procedure will be exactly the same as for all other public school students who attend campus programs. In the case of a homeschooled student who is enrolled in a private school satellite program (PSP), the PSP principal (or other administrator authorized by the principal) may issue the permit, as long as the permit is not going to his own child. In the case of a single family private school where parents operate their own private school, the parents will have several options. They can send their child to one of the alternative sources listed in Questions 5 or 6 for a permit, or the parents could engage an additional administrator to issue permits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="285">Thus, a homeschool parent who is the principal of his own family-sized school could add an administrator to his school staff. In order for the new administrator to issue permits, he must meet the self-certification process described below and must be authorized by the principal to issue permits. Further, nothing requires that school administrators work full-time, nor that they be paid employees, so the additional administrator could be a part-time volunteer. However, if anadministrator is paid, he would have to meet the criminal record summary requirements of Education Code Section 44237. If we decide to add an administrator to our homeschool program for the purpose of issuing work permits to our own children, do we need to file a new affidavit? Affidavits are required to be filed just once each year. The affidavit provides a statistical "snap shot" of your school as it existed on a particular date between October 1-15.</paragraph><paragraph parID="286">You do not need to file again every time your school information changes. Any new information will be reflected on next year's affidavit. Additionally, the affidavit does not require that every administrator be listed by name. Only a couple of key administrators are identified by name on the affidavit form; the rest are simply included in the tally showing total number of administrators. So for the next year, the only item likely to change as a result of adding an administrator is the total number of administrators in your school. What is the certification process for principals and administrators? The new law requires that principals and administrators who issue work permits "shall provide a self-certification that he or she understands the requirements in existing law for issuing a work permit."</paragraph><paragraph parID="287">The certification process is under development by the CDE, so details may change. However, at this time CDE reports it is preparing a form which will be available on its website for principals and administrators to use. A signed copy of the form will likely be required to be given to the local school district superintendent. Does any other paperwork have to be given to the local school district superintendent? A copy of each issued work permit must be given to the local school district superintendent, who has the authority to revoke a permit if he or she becomes aware that the student is not legally eligible for a work permit. Where does a principal or administrator find the legal requirements for work permits that he is supposed to understand in order to complete the certification process? Currently the most concise presentation is in the CDE's publication, "Work Permit Handbook for California Schools."</paragraph><paragraph parID="288">However, this handbook is being updated to reflect current law and the new version is not yet available at the writing of this article. The old 2009 version has misinformation about homeschooling and describes the process for obtaining permits under the old law. So until a newer edition is available, principals will have to use the old book for information on appropriate work sites, hours, and other information, but ignore the out-dated perspective on homeschooling. The manual is available at the date of this writing on the CDE website listed below. Under the new law, the hours a student can work are linked to the school in which the student is enrolled. However, the new law allows flexibility where a private school schedule is not the same as that of the public schools. Again, the CDE's work permit handbook reflects the old information.</paragraph><paragraph parID="289">Where does a private school principal get the work permit forms to issue? There are currently two forms used and, as already discussed, a third one will be added for the certification of principals and administrators issuing permits. In addition to the self-certification form being developed, the two forms needed are the B1-1, "Intent to Employ Minor and Request for Work Permit," and the B1-4 "Permit to Employ and Work." These forms are described in the work permit handbook. They will be available on the CDE website so that school principals and administrators can download and print them. Basically, the B1-1 is taken by the minor to the employer who intends to hire the minor. The form is filled out and taken to the principal or administrator who will issue the work permit.</paragraph><paragraph parID="290">The B1-4 form is the actual work permit. It is filled out and signed by the principal or administrator who has received the B1-1 and approves the minor's employment. Again, the CDE handbook covers all the requirements and explanations for these two forms. What is the CDE's website? The main CDE website is www.cde.ca.gov . Currently the page that covers work permit information is www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ct/we/wpfaq.asp .

Home-ed-politics@mainstream.com : Members discuss legal issues and U.S. law regarding homeschooling. The right to homeschool is recognized by every state in the country. It may well be more productive and protective of children to examine the social service systems that failed the children in North Carolina and New Jersey than to increase homeschool regulation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="292">The vast majority of parents act in the best interest of their children, an assertion with which the US Supreme Court agrees. In Parham v. J.R., 442 US 584 (1979), the Supreme Court stated, "That some parents 'may at times be acting against the interests of their children' creates a basis for caution, but is hardly a reason to discard wholesale those pages of human experience that teach that parents generally do act in the child's best interests The statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition." Another Supreme Court case, Troxel v. Granville, 530 US 57 (2000) states: "There is a presumption that fit parents act in their children's best interests Parham v. J. R., 442 U. S. 584, 602" It does not always solve the problems it intends to solve, and in this case there is no compelling reason to believe that it would address the concern of homeschoolers abusing their children. Legislation based on hypothetical and rare abuse situations would be bad law, putting financial and other burdens on states, schools, and social service agencies, and violating the rights and privacy of homeschooling families. It is also inextricably linked to the important question of who benefits from increased regulation of homeschooling. Based on all available evidence, increased regulation of homeschoolers would not prevent child abuse.</paragraph><paragraph parID="293">Given the emotional nature of the issue, it is especially vital that any response to the question of whether homeschooling should be regulated to prevent the potential abuse of children be carefully thought out. Knee jerk calls for regulation will do nothing to help children, and will only be detrimental to the homeschooling movement, which has shown itself to be a positive contribution to our society. And we can continue to remind people that protecting our right to educate our children at home without excessive government intervention is not at odds with the general welfare of children, and is, in fact, an essential component in maintaining the values of freedom on which our society is based. Since social services had already been notified by sources in the community, and had already observed the conditions in the homes on more than one occasion, it is highly unlikely that increased homeschooling regulation would have protected these children. At some point, we may face challenges to our homeschooling freedoms, and legislation or suggestions of legislation intended to address the issue of preventing child abusers from using homeschooling as a cover. Here are points to consider regarding what is sure to be an ongoing discussion in the media, our personal lives, and the legal arena. Don't muddy the issues First and foremost, homeschooling and child abuse are separate issues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="294">Attempts to link the two lack any basis in fact. While there may be homeschooling parents who abuse their children, children are not abused because they are homeschooled. Any regulation specifically focusing on preventing child abuse among homeschoolers would ignore the fact that child abuse occurs in the general population, not just in the homeschooling population. Parents of school children and preschoolers are not singled out for special observation. Background checks, home visits, and other invasions of privacy have been suggested as forms of regulation. Singling out a subset of parents for special observation on the basis of suspicion of abuse would be discriminatory. Mere suspicion does not constitute justification for increasing regulation across the board.</paragraph><paragraph parID="295">Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty? Homeschooling parents should not need to prove they are innocent of abusing their children as a condition for freely exercising their parental rights in education. Our own Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld parental rights in Care and Protection of Charles &amp; others, 399 Mass. 324 (1987), which stresses that state regulation cannot be excessive in order not to infringe on the liberty interests of the parents, and may only exist to satisfy the state's interest in the education of its citizenry. Excessive homeschooling regulation would inevitably represent a large cost to struggling school districts, without any guarantee of uncovering hidden cases of abuse. Home visits to check for evidence of abuse would require school officials to act in a capacity for which they do not have the legal authority or training. 9.

Educator Tax Deduction for Homeschoolers? "You work at least 900 hours a school year in a school that provides elementary or secondary education, as determined under state law."

We believe that many CAS workers, supervisors and family court judges are uninformed or misinformed about the laws and policies relating to home-based education in Ontario and which Ministry has jurisdiction over investigations that concern it. Beyond the fact that it exceeds the boundaries of CAS responsibilities and authority, we have serious concerns about such decisions being made by workers who may have limited or inaccurate knowledge about educational issues in general and homeschooling in particular. Provisions are made in the Education Act for investigations into the educational practices of homeschooling families. Instead, Section 24.2 assigns all necessary powers to the Provincial School Attendance Counselor (PSAC) to appoint inquiry officers from among education professionals and, if necessary, order a previously homeschooled child to attend school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="312">Policy/Program Memorandum No.131 (PPM131) provides additional direction as to how an investigation into a family's homeschooling should be conducted. This includes the questions of what constitutes "reasonable grounds" for an investigation and what understanding of home education should be brought to bear on the situation. We would like to see CAS workers, supervisors and family court judges become more familiar with these laws and policies so that concerns about educational matters can be addressed in accordance with them. Through PPM131, the Ministry of Education has already taken steps to remove what has been called the "institutional bias" towards homeschooling--the notion that home education should resemble school education. As explained to school board officials in PPM131, a homeschooling program does not need to replicate school at home in order to be considered satisfactory instruction: "The parent may not be following the Ontario curriculum, using standard classroom practices, teaching within the standard school day or school year." In other words, a less structured approach does not constitute educational neglect. While educational neglect would be a matter for investigation by the PSAC rather than CAS in any case, we believe a greater understanding by CAS workers would avoid altogether the issue of whether or not what they are observing is, in fact, neglect.</paragraph><paragraph parID="313">This, we feel, would help untangle educational issues from legitimate issues of physical and emotional neglect that do come under CAS jurisdiction. We need now to speak of actions that do call for us to challenge the good faith and integrity of some CAS workers. It is a delicate matter to address and we hope we can do so in a manner that makes clear our understanding that the practices we will be describing are not necessarily the norm among CAS workers nor endorsed by the Ministry. Nevertheless, there is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing by a number of CAS workers to warrant some concern. In every case reported to us homeschoolers have told us that CAS workers have exaggerated, used false information, lied in their affidavits and to get information from family doctors, health workers and board employees. Many of these lies have been corrected in court but were responsible for bringing the family into court in the first place. Once CAS has contacted families there is nowhere to register a complaint regarding the actions of a CAS worker except through the CAS worker him- or herself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="314">In cases where CAS workers have interviewed children without anyone else being present, the children have later stated that they never said what they are purported to have said. In this situation, it is a matter of a child's word, against the word of an adult in a position of professional authority, and the courts overwhelmingly support the latter even though the child may be telling the truth. We would like to see a proactive effort to instill, instead, a greater sense of respect for the families with which workers become involved, and to develop skills of communication and conflict resolution so that a family's encounter with CAS will always be truly helpful, engender the least amount of anxiety in parents and children alike and involve the least amount of disruption in their lives. We are concerned that such a situation could contribute to unwarranted CAS involvement with families. The reason this seems undesirable is that in spite of the mandate to protect children with the least amount of disruption to their lives, involvement by CAS workers invariably generates at the very least some anxieties within the family and at worst can traumatize the very children CAS is mandated to protect. a) that information about homeschooling be included in the curriculum of courses leading to the diploma required to become a CAS worker. b) that every CAS office have a copy of the Education Act and its related homeschooling policy, PPM131.</paragraph><paragraph parID="315">c) that every CAS office have a copy of additional materials created by OFTP in the form of an information package (we are in the process of updating the package we prepared for the OACAS convention held in Toronto in the year 2000). d) that every CAS worker be directed to refer to the above documents before handling a case involving a homeschooling family, whether or not the case also involves allegations of abuse or neglect. e) that judges hearing cases involving homeschoolers be given accurate legal information based on the Education Act and supplemented by PPM131. f) that CAS refer educational investigations to the authorities assigned by the Education Act to conduct them. By the same token, we have already made recommendations, during the MOE consultation that led to PPM131, that school officials refer cases of suspected abuse or non-educational neglect to CAS rather than try to address it through homeschooling policy. What concerns us, however, is that misunderstandings about what is legal, what homeschooling looks like, and whose responsibility it is to investigate educational matters, have led to situations where the homeschooling family's educational choice becomes a focus of contention and the rationale for intervention and sometimes drastic decisions. Homeschooling families who live in isolated rural areas are often all the more active in seeking out activities and community involvement as well as social situations with other homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="316">We believe a better understanding of homeschooling practices and perspectives would help alleviate concerns not only about educational neglect but also about whether homeschooled children are as a rule being adequately cared for physically and emotionally. We are willing to meet with the Ministry to discuss any of these issues and to help educate CAS employees as to the legalities of homeschooling, how homeschooling works, and what it might look like.

They are then expected to follow guidelines set up by officials. Homeschoolers are mostly ignored. The law in JAPAN is vague regarding home education. Compulsory education laws in MEXICO are vague enough to allow formal schooling to take place outside government schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="322">Homeschooling is not technically recognized by the law in the NETHERLANDS . But a court-created loophole allows parents to refuse to send their children to schools that do not teach according to their religious beliefs. Homeschooling in NEW ZEALAND has prospered for many years due to a positive legal atmosphere. Homeschoolers must register with the Ministry of Education. POLAND 's constitution guarantees parents the right to choose the type of schooling their children receive provided they comply with often-strict local regulations. Homeschooling is prohibited in ROMANIA except when children are ill or have special mental or physical needs. But a small homeschool movement is growing and working toward official recognition.</paragraph><paragraph parID="323">Homeschoolers in SINGAPORE must register with school officials, test their children, and show that they are teaching the same core subjects as public schools. Although statutory education law in SPAIN does not allow homeschooling, case law provides a loophole for parents who wish to provide an education for their children that conforms with their religious and moral beliefs. However, officials tend to be highly suspicious of home educators. Homeschooling was legalized in 1996 by a national education law, but each province has authority to set its own standards. SOUTH AFRICA 's vibrant homeschool community expects to soon face attack as government officials try to impose national curriculum standards on private education. Officials insist they are about to begin "rigorously monitoring" home education. Homeschooling is legal in SWITZERLAND but heavily regulated by local government provinces (called cantons).</paragraph><paragraph parID="324">Homeschooling in TAIWAN is legal with minimal government regulation. Homeschoolers work hard to build strong relationships with government officials and to communicate the success of homeschooling. A law passed in December 2000 allows for homeschooling in UKRAINE . However, local authorities often ignore the law and arbitrarily impose additional regulations. Homeschooling is completely legal in the UNITED KINGDOM (England and Wales), allowing children to attend school or "otherwise." Families are not required to inform authorities that they are home educating, and homeschoolers encounter few problems from school officials. Homeschooling is legal in all six states and both territories of AUSTRALIA .</paragraph><paragraph parID="325">Recent attempts to enact stronger regulations for homeschoolers have been largely unsuccessful due to the well organized and long established homeschool movement. An April 2003 court victory may indicate a positive trend toward more freedom. In recent years, the business community has begun supporting homeschooling, effectively deflecting government involvement. While some uninformed local officials may occasionally harass homeschooling families, for the most part, homeschoolers are free from government interference. discrimination against homeschoolers concerning the use of county community centers; discrimination against homeschool families concerning eligibility for federal retirement funds, Social Security benefits, and welfare payments; HSLDA's litigation team includes Jim Mason, homeschooling father of seven, who came on board in August 2001.</paragraph><paragraph parID="326">Darren Jones joined the team in December 2001&#65533;although he first came to HSLDA as a legal assistant in 1996, and then after passing the bar in 2000, served as a contact attorney. The HSLDA litigation team stays constantly busy working on the following types of cases: problems created by the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; daytime curfew laws; and problems with social workers. In addition, the litigation attorneys handle what Mike Farris refers to as "mop-up" cases. Some of the things we've already established in general principle, some school superintendents or some social workers refuse to acknowledge or don't understand.</paragraph><paragraph parID="327">They just don't get it. And so we have to make sure to continue that they get it and follow the law. GO THROUGH, GO THROUGH THE GATES The goal of all the work at HSLDA is to prepare the way and remove the obstacles for homeschooling parents, enabling their children to enter the gates of the land and engage the culture for Christ. REMOVE EVERY OBSTACLE The greatest obstacle pioneering homeschoolers faced two decades ago was daunting: in most states home education wasn't legal. When Mike Farris and Mike Smith joined forces in 1983 to form Home School Legal Defense Association, their desires clearly reflected the injunction of Isaiah to "Remove every obstacle out of the way of My people." Clearly, the path of homeschooling was strewn with stones (boulders, really) that had to be removed. Litigation became a key to removing the legal obstacles standing in the way of homeschooling families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="328">Then I asked him a stupid question&#65533;one that was objectionable, really&#65533;I didn't plan it ahead of time, it just popped into my head, "Did you get any legal advice before you denied this family the right to homeschool?" When the prosecutor didn't object to the question, the superintendent answered, "Well, I didn't get any legal advice. I didn't talk to any lawyers, but I talked to some government officials." These are the cases he chose, in chronological order: the DeJonge case in Michigan, the Jeffery case in Pennsylvania, the Diegel case in Ohio, the Triple E case in South Carolina, and the Calabretta case in California. The DeJonge case: Mandatory teacher certification On April 23, 1985, the state of Michigan issued warrants for the arrest of homeschooling parents Mark and Chris DeJonge, who were charged with criminal truancy because neither of them were certified teachers. In 1985, the DeJonges (pictured here in 1999) were charged with truancy in Michigan because they were not certified teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="329">HSLDA Senior Counsel Christopher Klicka remembers the frustrations: We argued the case at the district level and we lost. The judge wouldn't even let us introduce evidence that the children were scoring above average on the standardized achievement tests. He just wanted to know whether the parents were certified or not. It was an issue of control. We went to the Court of Appeals. "When we went to do the oral arguments at the Michigan Supreme Court, it was an exciting time," Mike Farris recalls.</paragraph><paragraph parID="330">Obstacle removed: Teacher certification law declared to be unconstitutional when in violation of religious freedom. The Jeffery case: Unconstitutionally vague On October 31, 1986, in Pennsylvania, HSLDA filed a federal civil rights action ( Jeffery, et al v. O'Donnell, et al ) on behalf of nine homeschooling families against 11 school districts. The case challenged the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's homeschool law, which gave each district superintendent the ability to create policy. Some schools in Pennsylvania were friendly to homeschoolers, but a number were harsh in terms of teacher qualifications and/or student testing requirements. When the judge ruled the Pennsylvania law 'unconstitutionally vague,' it was great. Obstacle removed: This August 24, 1988, decision laid the groundwork for having other state laws declared void for vagueness.</paragraph><paragraph parID="331">The Diegel case:Prejudice and inequity The Triple E case: Mandatory parent testing In June of 1988, the South Carolina General Assembly implemented a new homeschooling law, which included a requirement for teaching parents without college diplomas to take and pass the Education Entrance Examination (EEE&#65533;sometimes called the Triple E). The Triple E is a state-designed test that must be passed by college students desiring to become certified teachers. On May 24, 1989, Mike Farris filed a class-action suit in state court to suspend the Educational Entrance Exam (EEE) requirement for homeschool parents. HSLDA contended that the examination was improperly validated and the requirement was an unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of parents to direct the education of their children. On December 9, 1991, the South Carolina State Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="332">The effect of this ruling was to knock down the idea that states could require testing of homeschooling parents. On November 10, 1994, these officials, investigating anonymous child abuse allegations, forced entry into the family's home, interrogated a 12-year-old daughter, and strip searched a 3 year old, violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures. In 1995, HSLDA filed a civil rights lawsuit on behalf of the Calabretta family (pictured here in 1999) because their 4th Amendment rights had been violated by a social worker and police officer investigating a false child abuse allegation. In many instances, litigation has prepared the way for positive homeschooling legislation to be passed. In many states, the constant litigation initiated by HSLDA convinced state officials that passing positive homeschooling legislation would be a welcome relief. Although some government employees oppose homeschooling, most notably in the Department of Education's Legal Counsel's office, there is no indication that there is a systematic effort by the government to prevent homeschooling. First, compliance with one of the legal ways to homeschool is crucial.</paragraph><paragraph parID="333">The most important thing to do is know your legal rights.

After you read these articles, contact HSC Legal if you have any questions. Although a family has the legal right to start a home-based private school, it may be in the family's best interest to consider an option that will not subject them to scrutiny, such as a public independent study program, a charter school offering homeschooling, or a private school satellite program. Obtaining professional help early in the proceedings in the form of legal advise, mediation and/or evaluation by a family counselor can be invaluable if there is any possibility of a disagreement.

HSC has a long-standing legal fund and the ability to raise funds as needed for legal issues that might affect the rights of all homeschoolers.

Code section 48222) and read the recent case of Troxel et vir.</paragraph><paragraph parID="336">v. Granville U.S. (No. 99-138, Argued January 12, 2000 - Decided June 5, 2000). In Troxel the Supreme Court confirmed the fundamental right of parents to the care, custody, and control of their children. The Court included a parent's fundamental right to educate his or her child in those fundamental rights, which encompasses the right to choose private or home schooling. Any regulation of that fundamental right is subject to the strict scrutiny test. Under a new California law, welfare parents can be denied benefits if children are truant. Therefore, homeschooling parents in this situation may also with to consider alternatives to starting a home-based private school, such as a charter school or independent study programs. Homeschooling families are subject to the scrutiny of their community and can best avoid referrals by educating their family, friends and neighbors about the benefits of homeschooling and the educational progress homeschooled children are making.</paragraph><paragraph parID="337">At the same time, homeschoolers are encouraged to support all of the educational opportunities available, including the progress and opportunities available in the public schools, the private school options, tutoring, charter schools and the various homeschooling programs, keeping in mind that homeschooling is not for everyone. In certain situations, an investigation cannot be avoided, and the commencement of an action against a homeschooler cannot be construed as an indication that the homeschooling family did not comply with the law, had a problem that caused the investigation, or that the government is "against" homeschooling. When the government challenges independent homeschoolers it generally relies on two California cases that are not good precedent. Since the cases were decided, the United States Supreme Court ruled that parents have a fundamental right to educate their children and any governmental regulation is subject to strict scrutiny. HSC may contact the investigative agency, write a letter on behalf of the homeschooler, provide a referral to an attorney or give other appropriate assistance. Educational neglect cannot be a basis for an investigation and police officers and CPS workers cannot enter your home without a warrant . Families can protect themselves by documenting their daily activities and obtaining medical and psychological evaluations of their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="338">Do not let any CPS or Police Officer into your home or let them interview your children without a warrant. If they do speak to the children over your objection and without a warrant, they may be subject to civil penalties. The only exception to this rule is if it is alleged that the children are in eminent danger of physical or psychological harm. Truancy cases may result in a limitation to the right to homeschool if they are not handled correctly. Homeschoolers statewide are not having any problems with filing R-4s with their counties or the California Department of Education. CPS contacts with homeschoolers are rare and usually involve allegations not related to homeschooling. Contacting government officials by large numbers of homeschoolers has not been found to be an effective way to deal with pending truancy or juvenile dependency cases, and has in fact been prejudicial and harmful to the families involved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="339">A bill that speaks to the foundation of why many chose home education is now working its way through the house. House Bill 403, The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, strengthens religious freedom as a fundamental right. This act helps reinstate freedoms lost six years ago when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a 1993 (RFRA) Religious Freedom Restoration Act unconstitutional. This present-day RFRA puts the burden on the state to, &#65533;Prove, with evidence, that its regulation is essential to fulfilling the State&#65533;s compelling interest. The Act goes on to state: &#65533;If the state fails to carry the burden, the regulation must give way to the individual's religious freedom. This legislation places not only homeschoolers on the path to freedom, but everyone. Homeschoolers&#65533; Honor Society It seems Homeschoolers nationwide have created their own honor society to give above-average home-schooling students an equivalent academic recognition.</paragraph><paragraph parID="340">The National Honor Society and the National Beta Club do not accept home-schooled students because they only allow chapters which are associated with accredited educational institutions. This is the part where we get to brag . . . Last year, homeschoolers taking the SAT had an average score of 1092 compared with the national average score among public and private schooled students of 1020. (This data is according to statistics compiled by the Home School Legal Defense Association.) I don&#65533;t know if our wonderfully bright and charming homeschooled children have wowed skeptics or if the political climate has forced some to re-evaluate their priorities, but there are some government officials who are creating legislation in support of home education. For example, in Maine, Legislative Document 160 is being celebrated as the biggest improvement in that state&#65533;s homeschool law in 20 years. On February 20, the Joint Education and Cultural Affairs Committee voted unanimously to pass L.D.160. The bill now moves on to the House and Senate, where if it is approved as expected, the bill will eliminate most of the red tape that entangles homeschool families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="341">It is thanks to Senator Carol Weston&#65533;s work on behalf of homeschooling families that government interaction will be greatly reduced. Previously, at the start of each school year many Maine home-schoolers found themselves in a legal limbo waiting for the State Commissioner of Education to give them approval. This bill eliminates that department&#65533;s power to approve homeschooling. Instead, the requirement for families wishing to homeschool is replaced with a one-time notice that includes the name and address of the parent and child, age of child, the date home instruction will begin, and a parent&#65533;s signature assuring that 175 days of instruction will be provided and that the required subjects will be taught. In subsequent years, families who continue to homeschool will simply file a letter by September 1 informing the commissioner and local superintendent of their intent and provide an assessment. Good news is also coming out of Oregon, where on April 15th the Senate voted 20-9 to pass Senate Bill 761. This piece of legislation repeals the notice and testing requirements in Oregon&#65533;s homeschool law.</paragraph><paragraph parID="342">The passage of S.B. 761 changes the law in the following ways: 1) It expands the educational options for homeschoolers by providing that a child may be educated by the parent or legal guardian or "at the direction of" a parent or legal guardian. 2) It repeals the requirement that parents notify the public school officials of their decision to homeschool and repeals the testing requirements, except for students participating in interscholastic activities at a public school. 3) It removes the stipulation that the school districts will determines if a child under 18, who is being homeschooled, is eligible to get a driver's license. Parents are now free to teach their children at home without any contact with public school officials. Senate Bill 761 represents a major victory for homeschooling families in Oregon. A legislation action, Senate Bill 950 authored by Senator Richard Alarcon seeks to define truancy as child abuse and neglect. Mr. Alarcon believes California social workers should decide if a child is receiving an education, not their parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="343">It allows Child Protective Services to investigate homes where a child is not enrolled in a public or private school. This bill is gives power to CPS opening the door to legal proceedings that could result in loss of custody of your children unless you meet all the conditions CPS and the Juvenile Court dictate, including enrollment in the school of their choice (not yours). This legislation is another attempt to erode homeschooling freedoms without challenging the state law. This bill adds another government agency to the mix when dealing with truancy. Truancy law is outlined in the Education Code, Welfare and Institutions Code, Vehicle Code, and Penal Code. Asking Child Protective Services to address truancy law isn&#65533;t necessary. This bill discriminates.</paragraph><paragraph parID="344">It could force families into a situation where they will be forced to hire an attorney, placing an unfair burden on low-income families. CPS deals with allegations of physical abuse, sexual abuse; abandoned and neglected children who lack food, clothing, or medical treatment. This bill puts lack of enrollment or attendance in an education program at that same level. SB 950 is scheduled to be heard in the California Senate Health &amp; Human Services Committee on Wednesday, April 23, 2003. Home education advocates are optimistic that any attempts by the California legislature with be futile. They site a 1925 U.S. Supreme Court ruling Pierce v. Society of Sisters , (268 US 510, 535) where the court struck down an Oregon compulsory education law requiring parents to send their children to public schools. The court held that "the child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations."</paragraph><paragraph parID="345">In February of this year, the efforts of homeschoolers across Utah paid off when the Senate killed House Bill 76. H.B. 76 was designed to make it a crime to refuse to "cooperate" with school officials investigating truancy. This victory squashed one more attempt by Senator Duane Bourdeaux to make truancy a crime. Over the last several years he has filed similar legislation stating it is a crime to refuse to "cooperate" with school authorities who are investigating truancy. This was a very important issue for Utah home-schoolers, many who have never been "approved" by their local school district, and could be accused of "truancy." Utah's "approval" law is the next fight because any additional penalties on truants are a threat to many homeschooling families. On April 17, the Senate Education Committee Okayed Senate Bill 2060.</paragraph><paragraph parID="346">This legislation is now in the Senate awaiting passage. The Assembly is considering a similar bill Assembly Bill 4598. Both these legislative acts make the following changes to New York&#65533;s homeschool laws: Eliminate the requirement of an Individualized Home Instruction Plan (IHIP) Eliminate the requirement of quarterly reports; Eliminate required subjects at all grade levels; Permit the alternative method of evaluation (instead of standardized testing) every year;</paragraph><paragraph parID="347">Permit parents who wish to test their children to choose any nationally-normed standardized achievement test, in addition to a State Education Department test or another approved test; Eliminate the requirement that the local superintendent consent to the person who administers a standardized achievement test or who conducts the alternative method of evaluation; Lower the minimum standardized test score from above the 33rd percentile to above the 23rd percentile; and Eliminate the provision for home visits while a home instruction program is on probation Homeschooling advocates in the state of New York are applauding the probable passage of Senate Bill 2060 and Assembly Bill 4598. This legislation rids the state of the majority of its legal obstacles for homeschooling families, making New York my kind of town. In Tennessee, the legislature introduced House Bill 1982 and Senate Bill 1734 in February.</paragraph><paragraph parID="348">These bills expand the definition of "home school" to permit other family members to conduct a homeschool. These bills are now in committee so we will see if any changes are made. As they stand H.B.1982 and S.B. 1734 appear to support homeschooling. The Tennessee legislature, however, has not fully embraced home education. Legislation titled &#65533;A college scholarship bill for homeschoolers&#65533; -- House Bill 1178 and House Bill 475 -- along with Senate Bill 144, are far from perfect. H.B. 1178 would use lottery money to create college scholarships, but the bill would require homeschool students to score higher on the ACT or SAT than other students. H.B. 475 and S.B. 144 also offer scholarships to home-schoolers but a provision in the bill makes them not eligible until after their freshman year, whereas other students can apply prior to their freshman year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="349">Home education advocates in Tennessee are fighting against the bill until it treats home-schooled students equally. Another gift horse may be in New Hampshire&#65533;s House Bill 754. This bill establishes a Voucher System that allows the parent of a child in grades kindergarten through 12 to receive an educational certificate to be used to pay for educational programs at a nonpublic school or for a home education program. Homeschooling families need to be cautious when accepting government monies. Currently, H.B. 754 is in the House Education Committee awaiting further study. Don&#65533;t be surprised if terms like &#65533;mandatory assessment&#65533; or &#65533; meeting graduation requirements&#65533; are tied to the money. For example, in Minnesota, Senate File 760 and a companion bill, House File 743, try to use tax breaks as a way of controlling private education by making home education and private schools claiming the deduction, subject to the state's high school graduation requirements.</paragraph><paragraph parID="350">This bill is presently in an education committee. Driver Education Changes Next-door in Michigan, legislators know how to give a tax credit. Senate Bill 56 provides for an income tax credit for the cost of driver education programs. The credit may be claimed for the cost of driver education programs offered privately or through a public school. S.B. 56 is currently in the senate finance committee. Virginia, and Montana legislators are addressing driver&#65533;s education as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="351">Senate Bill 295 in Montana authorizes a parent to become a certified instructor for teaching driver's education to his own child. The Bill passed the Senate 31-19, paving the road for parent-taught driver's education in Montana. Home-educated students in Virginia will also learn to drive with their parents. On March 24, Virginia&#65533;s Governor Mark Warner signed into law House Bill 2404 allowing parents to teach the behind-the-wheel portion of driver education. The law goes into effect July 1, of this year. Topics range from legal issues and parental responsibilities to educational options and overcoming crises. Legal Issues</paragraph><paragraph parID="352">How to Legally Homeschool in Florida How Do I Comply with the Home Education Law? The sections of the Education Act most relevant to homeschoolers are sections 21(2)(a) and 24(2). One of the areas in which home educators may still disagree with the government's interpretation of the law, is in terms of whether section 30 of the Education Act ever applies to homeschoolers. Legal Issues in Home Education Legislation regulating homeschooling varies according to province (or state). The law governing home based learning in Ontario is the Ontario Education Act .</paragraph><paragraph parID="353">The Ministry of Education interpretation of that law in the form of policy (not itself law) is Policy/Program Memorandum #131 , which was released in June 2002. OFTP as advocate for homeschoolers The Ontario Federation of Teaching Parents has been very active in bringing about the change in policy that the PPM131 represents, and will continue to advocate for changes in various areas affecting homeschooling families. Know your rights We encourage home educators to know their rights by reading the relevant sections of government regulations and human rights documents quoted on this page: The applicability of section 30 is still a point of disagreement between the homeschooling community and the government. [emphasis added in these excerpts:]</paragraph><paragraph parID="354">21 - (2) A child is excused from attendance at school if, (a) the child is receiving satisfactory instruction at home or elsewhere; - (2) Where the parent or guardian of a child considers that the child is excused from attendance at school under subsection 21(2), and the appropriate school attendance counsellor or the Provincial School Attendance Counsellor is of the opinion that the child should not be excused from attendance, the Provincial School Attendance Counsellor shall direct that an inquiry be made as to the validity of the reason or excuse for non-attendance and the other relevant circumstances , and for such purpose shall appoint one or more persons who are not employees of the board that operates the school that the child has the right to attend to conduct a hearing and to report to the Provincial School Attendance Counsellor the result of the inquiry and may, by order in writing signed by him or her, direct that the child, (a) be excused from attendance at school; or (b) attend school, and a copy of the order shall be delivered to the board and to the parent or guardian of the child. (1) A parent or guardian of a child of compulsory school age who neglects or refuses to cause the child to attend school is, unless the child is legally excused from attendance , guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable to a fine of not more than $200. The entire PPM131 relates to home schooling, and we discuss the policy in detail on other pages, but the following excerpts represent the main points: [emphasis added] Procedures for Parents Parents who decide to provide home schooling for their child(ren) should notify the school board of their intent in writing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="355">Procedures for School Boards When parents give a board written notification of their intent to provide home schooling for their child, the board should consider the child to be excused from attendance at school, in accordance with subsection 21(2), clause (a), of the Education Act. The board should accept the written notification of the parents each year as evidence that the parents are providing satisfactory instruction at home. Normally, the board should not investigate the matter. Guidelines for Conducting an Investigation [...] Whether meeting with the family or reviewing information submitted in writing, board officials should recognize that the methodology, materials, schedules, and assessment techniques used by parents who provide home schooling may differ from those used by educators in the school system . PPM131 expresses a disputable interpretation of that section of the law in the following paragraph of the Guidelines for Conducting an Investigation :</paragraph><paragraph parID="356">[...] If the board is unable to determine from this investigation whether the child is receiving satisfactory instruction at home, it may take further action, in accordance with subsection 24(2) and/or section 30 of the Education Act. Canada is among the signing nations of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the General Assembly of the United Nations. While it states [ article 26(1) ] that elementary education shall be compulsory, it also states [ article 26(3) ] that Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children. [emphasis added] Because the public school system represents a gathering of people (schoolchildren and schoolteachers, etc) under a particular set of internal rules and regulations by which one is bound only if one is associating with it (- and not, for instance, if one is associating with a private school), one might also argue that it constitutes the equivalent of an association.

Well, the school tells us what kids our son's age do in school, and they want us to follow the same curriculum. Homeschooling is legal in Sweden. "There's No Place Like Home," a site which until recently offered information about homeschooling in Sweden, claimed that there are roughly 200 homeschooling families, about half of whom are doing so outside of the law. Once I was able to interview some Swedish homeschoolers and learned more about the legal, cultural, and social reality of homeschooling in Sweden, I could completely understand why some would either choose or feel compelled to fly under the legal radar. Homeschoolers in Sweden must apply for permission to homeschool every year, whether this is their first year homeschooling or their tenth. The application to homeschool takes it as a given that the children will "abide by the Swedish curriculum," and that there will be a certain amount of oversight to assure that this continues to be the case.</paragraph><paragraph parID="361">Although she is a strong believer in child-led education, and enjoys Waldorf-style nature-oriented homeschooling with her three children, she is also legally compelled to incorporate the national curriculum into her "school" day. by Deborah Markus, one of nine articles from the special "Homeschooling Around the World" section of Secular Homeschooling, Issue #6 , Spring 2009 Like many of my other articles about homeschooling in other countries, this one began with almost no previous knowledge on my part. For all I knew, homeschooling wasn't even a legal option in Sweden. Not only did the Swedish homeschooling sites I found have information available in my own tongue, but I was able to interview two fluent English-speaking Swedish homeschooling parents. Lennart Mogren, a teacher in Sweden who is interested in homeschooling as a viable alternative to Sweden's public schools, puts the number at "100 kids being homeschooled." This application makes it very clear what the most common doubts and concerns about homeschooling must be in Sweden.</paragraph><paragraph parID="362">As is the case in America, people unfamiliar with homeschooling in Sweden seem to have grave misgivings about homeschooled children having opportunities for healthy social activity. One of the paragraphs in the application (which seems to be a suggested template for parents wishing to apply for permission, rather than a word-for-word legal requirement) includes the following sentence: "Socially, [child's name] handles relationships with children of a similar age, and older friends, and adults, surprisingly well." The application to homeschool also has a space for the parents to "describe how it is possible for one parent to be at home with the child in home education." "There's No Place Like Home" mentioned that one of the reasons homeschooling is so unusual in Sweden is that the tax system makes it difficult for families to be able to afford to have one parent stay at home. "Many parents have an economic problem [with homeschooling], because our society is built on the idea that both parents are working," she told me. The state will take care of that!" Both the parents I spoke to mentioned that many Swedish people don't even know homeschooling is legal in their own country.</paragraph><paragraph parID="363">Ann's letter to me in reply to my call for interviews describes, as she put it, her family's "fight with the Swedish authorities": I searched the Internet and realized that I could homeschool! I found out that there were some families that actually did it, and that it was allowed by the law. We applied for permission to homeschool in October 2005. He was trying to make us believe that we could not do this, that it was very hard. And he didn't want to help us in any way, with materials and so on, if we got our permission. In December 2005 we received a no.</paragraph><paragraph parID="364">We appealed against that to "L&#228;nsr&#228;tten," the county administrative court. In September 2006 we received the answer: no again. The reason was that the social training would not be good enough out of school. Swedish law states it is okay to homeschool if "it is an adequate alternative" [to public school education]. The municipality is to examine that. And here is where the problem begins, because it is very much up to who is in charge in the municipality. In our case, we had a person that said to us that he did not like this in his municipality!</paragraph><paragraph parID="365">(Otherwise they can fine you, and we did not want that!) We appealed to the "Kammarr&#228;tten," the administrative court of appeal, in September 2006. There you first need a permission to be "received." In October 2007 (yes, that's right - it took over a year!) , we received the permission! That was a half victory: they started to work on our case. In March 2008, we received the answer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="366">In the judgement they told us that in 2005, we should have had our permission to homeschool our son! I called the administrative court of appeal and asked them. They said you apply again to the municipality and they ought to listen. We applied in March 2008 for our two kids to start homeschooling as soon as possible. Well, it took some time; they had to investigate, they said. They went to the school where our kids had to be during this time and asked them about our kids. In June 2008 we received a no again.</paragraph><paragraph parID="367">Now they said that our kids were in third and fourth grade, and the municipality meant that it was to hard to homeschool now. Besides that, the school said that our kids really needed more social training. We appealed against that decision to "L&#228;nsr&#228;tten" county administrative court again in June 2008. Still today, we have heard nothing at all from the county administrative court. I started to call different municipalities in Sweden and found a place where they said they had good experience of homeschooling families. The kids and I changed address in August, so they would not have to go back to the old school. Here the municipality has been wonderful, respectful and helping.</paragraph><paragraph parID="368">"Today I received the papers from the court. They canceled our case because we moved, so that's the end of the story." I felt humbled as I read Ann's story, and embarrassed at the complaints I've occasionally made about California's relatively easy annual filing process. True, the application can be a bit confusing, especially if you're nervous (and who isn't, when dealing with the government - especially regarding our children?) And I've never had to ask permission to homeschool - or go to court, not just once but many times, to get that permission. "It's been so tough to try to understand this with the law and court and so on," Ann said ruefully. Jenny Lantz, whose three children have all been homeschooled from day one, had an easier time of it legally:</paragraph><paragraph parID="369">Well, although the situation for homeschoolers in Sweden is harsh, we had no problems to get the permission needed to homeschool. We contacted the head of schools in our municipality for a meeting, talking friendly with him with our kids present, and explaining our will to homeschool. But the school that controls us has difficulty in understanding child-led education, and they control us more than we want.

Is homeschooling legal in New Jersey? Homeschooling has never been illegal in NJ. The information contained in this document is not intended as legal advice.</paragraph><paragraph parID="376">If you have a legal dispute with your school district, NJHA recommends that you seek advice from a practicing New Jersey attorney. NJHA offers assistance in settling disputes before they become legal issues. However, it took a pair of court rulings* in the 1960s to convince public school districts that "equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school" included homeschooling. * State v. Vaughn, 44 N.J. 142 (1965) and State v. Massa, 95 N.J. Super. 382 (1967) Are we required to notify the school district? There is no law that says we must notify the districts that we are homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="377">Many people never notify and never have any problems. However, in the Vaughn decision, the judge found that parents, if brought into court on truancy charges, must introduce evidence that their children are receiving "equivalent instruction" and are not truant. (The burden of proof then falls upon the State to show that the instruction isn't equivalent.) For this reason, many homeschoolers over the years have chosen to inform their district of their intentions, thereby basically insuring themselves against misunderstandings and possible truancy charges. Some homeschoolers prefer to send a "letter of notification" to the district, giving the names of the children and stating simply that these children will be homeschooled. This is best if you are removing children from a school in which they've been enrolled, as the district will certainly notice that they've not been asked to transfer records. This is also a good idea if you are in a hostile district known to harass homeschoolers, as it robs them of the chance to "discover" you and charge you with truancy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="378">Are we required to follow a schedule? All NJ schools, public and private, determine their own schedules. Public schools are required to provide 180 days of instruction. Since homeschoolers are not public schools, we are not required to give evidence of any number of "instructional days" or hours, nor are we required to follow or to submit a schedule. Must we use the school's curriculum? In the Massa decision, the judge determined that homeschoolers are free to use whatever curriculum, materials or methods they choose. In the best schools, teachers have the freedom to individualize the curriculum for each child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="379">They aren't required to stick with a lesson plan or book if they've found something better, or if the student's learning doesn't conform to the planned speed and schedule. Homeschoolers have this same freedom, and more. What if the school doesn't approve our curriculum? A school district is not permitted to deny a family's right to homeschool based on its "disapproval" of educational materials. This was firmly decided in the Massa decision. All the district is permitted to do is to ask if we are covering the major subject areas. Some school administrators don't understand this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="380">They believe that they have the right to study our curriculum and materials to see that the content and quality match those used by their school. This is wrong. Unfortunately, some homeschoolers are being given bad advice, and are told that they must submit their materials to their local district's administration for "approval." And the more homeschoolers who follow this advice, the more administrators there will be who believe they have the authority to demand this of the rest of us. Do I need a certicate to teach? Teaching certificates are required only in public schools and in certain private schools that are funded by public education money. Can we homeschool our special-needs child?</paragraph><paragraph parID="381">The law makes no distinction between "regular" and "special-needs" students. State and Federal laws pertaining to education require the availability of testing to identify special-needs students, but parents are not required to accept these services. (Note: In some cases parents can be required to accept such services, but only when a court has found them guilty of educational neglect. Such court findings are rare.) What about testing? There are no requirements for testing of homeschooled students. Some parents may wish to use standardized tests to determine their child's progress.</paragraph><paragraph parID="382">Public school districts are not required to offer such tests to homeschoolers. (Some schools do allow homeschoolers to take the test used by the local district.) A passing score on the High School Proficiency Test (HSPT) is required for anyone seeking a public school diploma. It is not required for students not graduating from a public school. How do homeschoolers get a diploma? Diplomas are issued by the schools in which graduates were enrolled. If you are homeschooling, you can obtain a diploma through an "umbrella school" such as Clonlara, Oak Meadow or Hewitt.</paragraph><paragraph parID="383">You can obtain a diploma from a curriculum program such as Sonlight or A Beka. Or you can print one yourself. There are no restrictions on who can issue diplomas. A diploma is only as good as the issuer. Public schools are not required to permit nonenrolled students to take part in academic or extracurricular activities. Nor are they prohibited from doing so. If a homeschooling student wishes to take a class, join a team or club, or attend a dance at his or her local school, this must be arranged between the district and the family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="384">School districts don't have the authority to demand more from homeschoolers than the law demands of us. They may not set deadlines. They may not ask for personal information other than the child's name, address and birthdate. They may not dictate our curriculum or tell us what materials to use. NJHA strongly recommends that homeschoolers do not give in to such demands. If an administrator from your local school district is actively hostile, or demanding more information than the law requires, print out and send a copy of the NJ State Board of Education's 2000 booklet As a courtesy, I am sending this letter to inform you that my daughter, [name], who attended [previous school name] through the end of 7th grade, will be homeschooled, starting this year, in accordance with N.J.S.A. 18A:38-25.</paragraph><paragraph parID="385">If the school writes back asking for more information, download and send them a copy of NJ State Board of Education's What is Homeschooling? Homeschooling refers to a situation where a parent or guardian educates a school-aged child through a home study program. Programs vary, but include the basic academic subjects taught in schools such as reading, math, and science. Yes, homeschooling is legal. However, the laws differ depending on your state and school district. State law commonly requires that the parent or guardian doing the homeschooling have a high school diploma.</paragraph><paragraph parID="386">Beyond that, state homeschooling laws fall into one of the following categories: No notice required: a parent or guardian may choose to homeschool a child without providing any notification to the state Low regulation: a parent or guardian is simply required to notify proper authorities of homeschooling Moderate regulation: a parent or guardian must send notification, plus test scores or other professional assessments of the child's progress High regulation: a parent or guardian must send notification, test scores or professional assessments and also may be required to obtain state approval of the curriculum, teacher qualification, or meetings with state officials How Can I Begin Homeschooling?

Again, parents receiving public assistance are absolutely entitled to start a home-based private school, but must be extremely careful to follow the law when setting up the school because it is likely that the school will be subject to scrutiny.</paragraph><paragraph parID="389">As soon as a homeschool family receives notice of a truancy referral or is denied welfare benefits based on a truancy allegation, a copy of the R-4 and a verification of enrollment and attendance in private school should be provided to the agency. Contact HSC Legal (or 1-888-HSC-4440) immediately for assistance. Second, the following factors may result in a referral: Pulling children out of public or private school after a dispute with the school (i.e.: ongoing truancy problems); custody battles; welfare referrals; or neighborhood disputes. As long as children are healthy, happy, involved with the community, and appear to be learning and thriving, the likelihood of a referral is reduced. What can you do if you are in one of the "high-risk" groups for referral? If a child is removed from public school mid-year or after continuing problems with the school , the options must be carefully considered. As an attorney handling family law cases and juvenile dependency cases, I saw children suffer because both parents put their own needs for control ahead of their children's welfare.</paragraph><paragraph parID="390">That means that there must be a compelling state interest for the regulation. Under most circumstances, no additional school records or information should be given to the agencies. Most of these cases can be handled quickly and easily at the first contact, but become more complicated if not handled effectively at the beginning. CPS Investigations begin with a referral. Providing these reports to CPS investigators, with a letter stating that they do not need to see the children since the medical and psychological evaluations show that the children are safe, may alleviate the agency's concerns and prevent further investigations. How Can HSC Help? Therefore it is imperative that homeschoolers proceed cautiously.</paragraph><paragraph parID="391">What can our members do? First and foremost, homeschoolers do not need to be alarmed. Homeschooling our children is an effective form of activism. It is important that homeschoolers recognize that government officials are generally people who care deeply about their work, and are motivated by a desire to help children. The most effective negotiation is to recognize our common ground and reach for solutions that will meet all of our needs. As the SCAIHS board looks on in 1992, South Carolina Governor Carroll Campbell signs a law authorizing a private-sector alternative to public school supervision for homeschooling parents. In December 1985, a neighbor informed me of regulations promulgated by the state department of education requiring homeschooling parents to possess a college degree from an accredited institution, and to use only state-approved texts in their homeschools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="392">HSLDA countered by filing a class action suit on behalf of SCAIHS members, asserting that SCAIHS was in fact a legal option for homeschoolers. Many other states had been waiting in the wings with plans to test non-degreed parents before granting them approval to homeschool. The summer of 1984, my husband Joe and I applied for "permission" to homeschool our six-year-old son, Ty. We unwittingly walked into a hornet's nest, as state and local officials and agencies in South Carolina were just beginning to work together to discourage homeschooling in our state. We didn't know, then, that a fledgling organization called HSLDA had recently been started on the West Coast for situations like ours (see "The Curtain Rises on HSLDA" in the January/February 2003 Home School Court Report). Instead, we set out to hire our own legal counsel. Just finding a lawyer who had ever heard of homeschooling was difficult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="393">Finding one who understood homeschooling in the context of school law and constitutional rights seemed impossible. Our attorney's first task was to research what we had to do to comply with South Carolina law, as both the local school district and the state department of education refused to provide us with that information. After the local school board denied our application, our attorney had to file the proper paperwork for us to appeal our case to the state board of education, as well as represent us there. We were informed by several officials that the state board of education, in cases like ours, simply upheld the local school board's decision. The mounting legal and financial implications invaded our lives as we suddenly faced the possibility of expensive appeals, coupled with the frightening prospect of having our children forcibly removed from our home. The day after I was threatened with jail, my father spoke at a hospital trustees' convention, sharing the podium with Nancy Thurmond, the senator's wife. I had no idea at the time that the next phase of the journey would span eight years and would be a perilous uphill climb, involving all sorts of legislative and legal maneuverings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="394">Mike Farris began by filing a class-action suit to overturn the Triple E requirement for homeschool parents. Amidst the appeals process for the Triple E case, South Carolina homeschoolers decided to form the South Carolina Association of Independent Home Schools (SCAIHS), a private-sector alternative to public school supervision for homeschooling parents. South Carolina homeschoolers were fighting a war on two fronts-one against the Triple E legislation and one in support of SCAIHS. It has been 19 years since Joe and I began our homeschooling journey, and 16 years since we became HSLDA members. HSLDA's continued presence and pressure in court opened up legislative avenues for South Carolina families through which we secured much greater homeschooling freedom. In addition to their legal representation and legislative aid, their constant counsel, coaching, and prayer support have been invaluable. To this day, state officials know that we have outstanding attorneys to represent us should they try to thwart our freedom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="395">I thank the Lord constantly for HSLDA and for what the organization has meant in the lives of homeschoolers throughout our state.

Their reason was that children, "are not mature enough for formal school programs until their senses, coordination, neurological development and cognition are ready." They concluded that the outcome of forcing children into formal schooling is a sequence of "1) uncertainty as the child leaves the family nest early for a less secure environment, 2) puzzlement at the new pressures and restrictions of the classroom, 3) frustration because unready learning tools - senses, cognition, brain hemispheres, coordination - cannot handle the regimentation of formal lessons and the pressures they bring, 4) hyperactivity growing out of nerves and jitter, from frustration, 5) failure which quite naturally flows from the four experiences above, and 6) delinquency which is failure's twin and apparently for the same reason." &lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Raymond S.

The Moore's cited a Smithsonian Report on the development of genius, indicating a requirement for "1) much time spent with warm, responsive parents and other adults, 2) very little time spent with peers, and 3) a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance." &amp;lt;ref name="moore"/&amp;gt; Their analysis suggested that children need "more of home and less of formal school" "more free exploration with... parents, and fewer limits of classroom and books," and "more old fashioned chores - children working with parents - and less attention to rivalry sports and amusements." &amp;lt;ref name="moore"/&amp;gt; John Taylor later found, using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale, "while half of the conventionally schooled children scored at or below the 50th percentile (in self-concept), only 10.3% of the home-schooling children did so." &lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;Self-Concept in home-schooling children, John Wesley Taylor V, Ph.D., Andrews University, Berrien Springs, MI&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that "the self-concept of home-schooling children is significantly higher (and very much so statistically) than that of children attending the conventional school. This has implications in the areas of academic achievement and socialization, to mention only two.</paragraph><paragraph parID="403">These areas have been found to parallel self-concept. Regarding socialization, Taylor's results would mean that very few home-schooling children are socially deprived. He states that critics who speak out against homeschooling on the basis of social deprivation are actually addressing an area which favors homeschoolers. &lt;ref name="taylor"/&gt; In 2003, the National Home Education Research Institute conducted a survey of 7,300 U.S. adults who had been homeschooled (5,000 for more than seven years). Their findings included: Homeschool graduates are active and involved in their communities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="404">71% participate in an ongoing community service activity, like coaching a sports team, volunteering at a school, or working with a church or neighborhood association, compared with 37% of U.S. adults of similar ages from a traditional education background. Homeschool graduates are more involved in civic affairs and vote in much higher percentages than their peers. 76% of those surveyed between the ages of 18 and 24 voted within the last five years, compared with only 29% of the corresponding U.S. populace. The numbers are even greater in older age groups, with voting levels not falling below 95%, compared with a high of 53% for the corresponding U.S. populace. 58.9% report that they are "very happy" with life, compared with 27.6% for the general U.S. population. 73.2% find life "exciting", compared with 47.3%. &lt;ref&gt; HSLDA | Homeschooling Grows Up &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt;</paragraph><paragraph parID="405">UK: Paula Rothermel ROTHERMEL, P. (2002) Home education: Aims, Practices and Outcomes. PhD thesis, University of Durham. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;pjrothermel.com/phd/Home.htm&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; ROTHERMEL, P.

(2005) Can we classify motives for home education? Evaluation and Research in Education, 17(2)(3). Homeschooling is a legal option for parents in all 50 United States and some countries to provide their children with a learning environment as an alternative to public or private schools outside the home. Rushdoony was frequently called as an expert witness by the HSLDA ( Home School Legal Defense Association ) in court cases.</paragraph><paragraph parID="406">Although the companies typically offer no teacher support or credit, homeschool families can, depending on their legal method of homeschooling, grant credit for work that includes the use of these materials if mastery is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the parents or other persons with oversight responsibility. Working in a similar vein was Rousas John Rushdoony who focused on education in America and was an advocate of homeschooling, which he saw as a way to combat the intentionally secular nature of the U.S. public school system. He vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as Horace Mann and John Dewey and argued for the dismantling of the state's influence in education in three works: Intellectual Schizophrenia (a general and concise study of education), The Messianic Character of American Education (a history and castigation of public education in the U.S.), and The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum (a parent-oriented pedagogical statement). Some of the leadership of HSLDA ascribe to Rushooney's theology of Christian Reconstructionism which may have an influence on their political involvement. During this time, the American educational professionals Raymond and Dorothy Moore began to research the academic validity of the rapidly growing Early Childhood Education movement. This research included independent studies by other researchers and a review of over 8,000 studies bearing on Early Childhood Education and the physical and mental development of children. They asserted that formal schooling before ages 8-12 not only lacked the anticipated effectiveness, but was actually harmful to children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="407">The Moores began to publish their view that formal schooling was damaging young children academically, socially, mentally, and even physiologically. They presented evidence that childhood problems such as juvenile delinquency, nearsightedness, increased enrollment of students in special education classes, and behavioral problems were the result of increasingly earlier enrollment of students. &amp;lt;ref name=Moore93&amp;gt;Better Late Than Early, Raymond S. Moore, Dorothy N. Moore, Seventh Printing, 1993&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; The Moores cited studies demonstrating that orphans who were given surrogate mothers were measurably more intelligent, with superior long term effects - even though the mothers were mentally retarded teenagers - and that illiterate tribal mothers in Africa produced children who were socially and emotionally more advanced than typical western children, by western standards of measurement. &amp;lt;ref name=Moore93/&amp;gt; Their primary assertion was that the bonds and emotional development made at home with parents during these years produced critical long term results that were cut short by enrollment in schools, and could neither be replaced nor afterward corrected in an institutional setting. &lt;ref name=Moore93/&gt; Recognizing a necessity for early out-of-home care for some children - particularly special needs and starkly impoverished children, and children from exceptionally inferior homes- they maintained that the vast majority of children are far better situated at home, even with mediocre parents, than with the most gifted and motivated teachers in a school setting (assuming that the child has a gifted and motivated teacher). They described the difference as follows: "This is like saying, if you can help a child by taking him off the cold street and housing him in a warm tent, then warm tents should be provided for all children - when obviously most children already have even more secure housing."</paragraph><paragraph parID="408">&amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;Better Late Than Early, Raymond S. Moore, Dorothy N. Moore, 1975&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Similar to Holt, the Moores embraced homeschooling after the publication of their first work, Better Late Than Early , 1975, and went on to become important homeschool advocates and consultants with the publication of books like Home Grown Kids , 1981, Homeschool Burnout , and others. &amp;lt;ref name =Moore93/&amp;gt; At the time, other authors published books questioning the premises and efficacy of compulsory schooling, including Deschooling Society by Ivan Illich , 1970 and No More Public School by Harold Bennet , 1972. In 1976, Holt published Instead of Education; Ways to Help People Do Things Better . In its conclusion, he called for a "Children's Underground Railroad " to help children escape compulsory schooling. &amp;lt;ref name="Christine_Field_Patrick"/&amp;gt; In response, Holt was contacted by families from around the U.S. to tell him that they were educating their children at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="409">In 1977, after corresponding with a number of these families, Holt began producing Growing Without Schooling , a magazine dedicated to home education. &amp;lt;ref name="BHHS"&amp;gt; http://www.hsc.org/professionals/briefhistory &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; In 1980, Holt said, "I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools. I think that the home is the proper base for the exploration of the world which we call learning or education. Home would be the best base no matter how good the schools were." &lt;ref name = "kwmzdt"&gt; A Conversation with John Holt (1980) &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Holt later wrote a book about homeschooling, Teach Your Own , in 1981.</paragraph><paragraph parID="410">One common theme in the homeschool philosophies of both Holt and the Moores is that home education should not be an attempt to bring the school construct into the home, or a view of education as an academic preliminary to life. They viewed it as a natural, experiential aspect of life that occurs as the members of the family are involved with one another in daily living. Individual governmental units, e, g, states and local districts, vary in official curriculum and attendance requirements. Certain states, such as Maine and New Mexico, have laws that permit homeschooling families to take advantage of public school resources. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt; http://newsroom.dc.gov/show.aspx/agency/seo/section/2/release/14329 DC State Board of Education Approves Homeschooling Regulations July 16, 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; But some legal commentators have noted that child abuse occurs in public school and state social care systems, and that there is no evidence suggesting that abuse among homeschoolers is more pervasive or severe than the considerable dangers encountered in government institutions. Therefore, homeschooling is deemed to be illegal. The legal position is complex; as homeschooling is uncommon, local officials may claim it is illegal but this is not actually the case.</paragraph><paragraph parID="411">Homeschooling is legal in Austria. In Finland homeschooling is legal but unusual. The inspection is carried out to check that the child's knowledge has progressed as a comparison from the previous inspection; sometimes it involves written tests, though those are illegal, in both French and Mathematics, the first of which is used as a benchmark to check what level the child is. Homeschooling is illegal in Germany (with rare exceptions). In Italy, homeschooling (called Istruzione parentale in Italian ) is legal but not common: children must be registered to the school where they will take their final exams, and parents must justify their decision to homeschool their children at the beginning of every year. &amp;lt;ref&amp;gt;White House News &amp;amp; Policies No Child Left Behind &amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Some U.S. states require mandatory testing for homeschooled students, but others do not. Some states that require testing allow homeschooling parents to choose which test to use.</paragraph><paragraph parID="412">It has been claimed that the homeschooling exemption in the District of Columbia allowed the abuse of the children to occur undetected. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/12/us/12bodies.html?ref=us Jane Gross Lack of Supervision Noted in Deaths of Home-Schoole d New York Times, January 12, 2008&amp;lt;/ref&amp;gt; Increased regulation of homeschooling in DC has been enacted in response to these events. One group believes in individual rights and the right of the parent to raise his or her own child in the way that the parent sees as best for the child. The other group believes in communalism, in which the State has a responsibility to ensure optimal development in all children. The Compulsory Education Law states that the community, schools and families shall safeguard the right to compulsory education of school-age children and adolescents, and, compulsory education is defined as attending a school, which is holding a schooling licence granted by the government. The law does not apply to non-citizen children (those with foreign passports). However, due to the large population of hundreds of millions of migration workers, alongside with their children, it rarely happens that the government inspects if a child is attending a licensed school or not.</paragraph><paragraph parID="413">Thus there usually is no punishment to parents who homeschool their children. Attendance at school is compulsory and free for students aged six to fifteen in Hong Kong. Parents who fail to send their children to school can be jailed for 3 months and fined HK$10000. After 2.5 years of discussion, the Education Department finally served an "attendance order" on him and his child was required to attend a normal school. However, every homeschooled child is required to take an exam, administered four times per year, to ensure that he or she is being educated at an appropriate level. If the child fails the test, he or she must attend a state school the following year. Children have to be registered as home-educated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="414">In Wallonia, the French-speaking part of the country, they are tested at 8, 10, 12, abn 14. The parents are responsible for the child getting the compulsory education and the advancements are supervised by the home municipality. The parents have the same freedom to make up their own curriculum as the municipalities have regarding the school, only national guiding principles of the curriculum have to be followed. Choosing homeschooling means that the municipality is not obliged to offer school books, health care at school, free lunches or other privileges prescribed by the law on primary education, but the ministry of education reminds they may be offered. Children cannot be exempted from formal school attendance on religious grounds. The requirement for children from an age of about 6 years through the age of 16 to attend school has been upheld, on challenge from parents, by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany . Penalties against parents who force their children to break the mandatory attendance laws may include fines (around &#8364;5,000), actions to revoke the parents' custody of their children, and jail time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="415">In the Netherlands every child is subject to compulsory education from his/her fifth birthday. The exemptions are extended on the basis of a clause in the law exempting parents from sending their child to school if they object to the "direction" of the education of all schools within a reasonable distance to their home. Homeschooling is only allowed on highly regulated terms. The number of homeschoolers in Russia has tripled since 1994 to approximately 1 million. [ citation needed ] Russian homeschoolers are attached to an educational institution where they have the right to access textbooks and teacher support, and where they pass periodic appraisals of their work. The State is obliged to pay the parents cash equal to the cost of educating the child at the municipal school. You may have heard of the recent ruling in California by an appellate court that a homeschooling family must send their children to public school because, basically, it's not legal in CA to homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="416">In California, there is no reference to "homeschooling" in the laws or education codes. The laws were designed for that purpose in mind, with different wording for schools that have less than six children, and who are being taught by a family member. In other words, although homeschooling isn't in the laws, it's not a secret, nor is the department of education "turning the other cheek". The judges' ruling says that that a child has to be either physically attending a private school, or he has to be tutored by a credentialed teacher, and those are the only two choices. And, there is no indication that it was intended to change California law. In fact, if you look at the ruling, it has a strong implication that it was a last resort effort to get this family out of a many-year struggle with the state. What does this mean for the larger issue - how homeschooling is conducted in the state of California?</paragraph><paragraph parID="417">The major homeschooling organizations in California, along with the Virginia based HSLDA, announce today that they are working together in a united effort to preserve independent homeschooling in California as it has been practiced for decades. Representatives from the California based organizations are meeting in Sacramento today to discuss homeschooling and distribute their joint statement. We are united in the goal of protecting the right of parents to teach their children privately at home without additional governmental interference. We support the right of parents to direct their children's education including, if they desire, teaching their children privately at home apart from any public school program and without a teaching credential. We believe that the opinion rendered by the Second District Court of Appeals in the case titled "In re Rachel L." on February 28, 2008 is excessively broad in its scope and incorrectly states the law as applied to home education in California. We believe that the interpretation of California law, as understood by our organizations and by the California Department of Education prior to the issuance of this decision, is correct, that the interests of both the State of California in ensuring that children are educated adequately and of parents in directing their children's education are well met by this prior interpretation of law, and that no change in California law regarding the teaching of children privately at home is needed. But it does mean that we might not have to fight as hard as we might have otherwise, because not only is the is our governor and his crew openly supporting homeschooling, we are also on the same page about the value of teaching credentials for homeschooling parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="418">"As long as they are a private school registered with the state then as far as we are concerned they are a legal home school," said Victor Thompson, director of student support service for the L.A. County Department of Education. What do you think of the HSLDA petition to depublish the court's opinion? Although this resolution will not sway the supreme court any more than HSLDA's petition, its presentation for vote will give the California State Assembly, and the rest of the politicians in CA, clear message that homeschoolers are unified in CA. This is just one small part of what we can do, and not a ticket to opt-out of the rest of the effort to keep homeschooling free from regulation in CA. Jack O'Connell , California's State Superintendent of Public Instruction, issued a statement today regarding the recent California appellate court opinion on homeschooling. SACRAMENTO - State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O'Connell announced today that the California Department of Education has completed a legal review of the February 28 California Court of Appeal ruling regarding home schooling. "I have reviewed this case, and I want to assure parents that chose to home school that California Department of Education policy will not change in any way as a result of this ruling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="419">Parents still have the right to home school in our state. Assemblymember Joel Anderson, a conservative Republican whose children are taught at home, has introduced a concurrent resolution in the California Assembly. The resolution basically states as follows: that homeschooled children perform well at college and in life, that there is a rich history of homeschooling, that an estimated 200,000 children in California and 2,000,000 children in the U.S. are taught at home, that the U.S. Constitution recognizes the fundamental right of parents to have their children educated outside of state schools, that the appellate decision is misguided, and that the Supreme Court should reverse the decision. I encourage members of HSC and all other homeschoolers in the state to contact their representatives (currently, just the Assemblymembers, as it is not pending before the Senate and will just confuse your Senator's office if you call now) and encourage them to vote in favor of ACR 115. Also, and perhaps more importantly, representatives from each group are in the state capitol today, meeting with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's Undersecretary of Education, and several members of the CA state assembly. 2. We believe that children deserve to learn in the environment that best meets their individual needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="420">3. For further information, please contact these organizations as follows: "My feeling is very much in line with the governor in that it is a parental choice as to how they will educate their children," said Chris Bertelli, assistant secretary of education. He's quoted later to say: Chris Bertelli is a CA Assistant Secretary of Education . This quote is good news for CA homeschoolers. Of course, it doesn't mean we can all go on vacation now.</paragraph><paragraph parID="421">He's just one of the many people who work with David Long (CA Secretary of Education) and Arnold Schwarzenegger. It also quotes the director of student support services for the LA County Dept. of Education: I'm not sure why they talked to Victor Thompson, or how they found him to interview. I couldn't find him anywhere on the internet. Maybe they called the LA Dept. of Education and he's who they got. I hope that his opinion reflects the entire LA public school position. Again, not because it will actually change anything, but because it will make our future efforts less difficult if we have a good number of large education departments sharing common positions with us.</paragraph><paragraph parID="422">In the past week, I've done four interviews (two for TV, one for radio, and one for the paper). These are some of the questions I was asked about the Long's case and the appellate court's ruling. I am of two minds about the HSLDA petition. The petition's intention is in alignment with the efforts coordinated by all the California homescholing organizations. In that regard, it's a positive action that people can make in response to the court's ruling. However, the petition is not likely to have much, if any, effect on whether the opinion will be depublished. The Supreme Court will look at the legal arguments that are presented, not public opinion.</paragraph><paragraph parID="423">My concern is that the people who sign this petition think that their work is done. It is not. We cannot consider signing an ineffective petition as enough of an effort to make a difference. What do you think of Assemblyman Joel Anderson's resolution to reverse the appellate court's opinion (ACR 115)? It is important that as many people as possible support this resolution. We also can see which Assemblymen will vote for, or against, this resolution. Again, this is not the end-all of support.</paragraph><paragraph parID="424">What do you think of the Long family's appeal to the Supreme Court? I was asked this question, and I wasn't sure how to answer it. It seems obvious to me that they would do this, irregardless of what's going on in the homeschooling community. I'm assuming that all of the efforts by the CA homeschooling groups to depublish the opinion are being conducted with full knowledge of the appeal. As far as I know, depublishing is still the main goal, whether or not the Supreme court accepts the appeal case. I see it this way: the Long family is concerned about their family, and CA homeschoolers are concerned with the particular section of the opinion that pertains to the education code. If those two efforts overlap, it doesn't change our intentions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="425">4. Who should we listen to? CHN? HSLDA? The news? I can't tell you who to listen to. That's up to you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="426">I would encourage you, however, to listen to as many different people and organizations as you can stand. I am on way too many e-lists, and I watch the google alerts. But I feel that I'm getting a multi-dimensional view of what's going on. The information that I pass along here on this blog, are things that either are objective truths (Joel Anderson and his resolution, for example), or are opinions that resonate throughout the entire coalition of homeschooling groups in CA. If one group says something, and nobody else does, I make sure to ask around to see if it's a rogue opinion. I also take care to see who is making the statement, and what their goals are. So listen to who you want to listen to, but keep in mind that many people and groups are working on this, and listening to only one source might not paint an accurate picture.</paragraph><paragraph parID="427">5. Should we be worried? I am of the opinion that even if we were literally being thrown into concentration camps, we still shouldn't be worried. Mad, yes. Motivated, yes. On high alert, yes. Prepared, absolutely.</paragraph><paragraph parID="428">But worry is a waste of energy. Worry makes us impatient. Worry makes it difficult to see all the data. Worry gets in the way of good decision making. Dump the worry, and replace it with determination. Right now, the best thing we can do to "beat" this, is to keep homeschooling. Don't let them see us sweat (even if everything is falling apart).</paragraph><paragraph parID="429">(This was forwarded to our e-lists. If you have a link, please email me.) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PHONE: 916-319-0818 March 11, 2008 E-MAIL: hmclean@cde.ca.gov SCHOOLS CHIEF JACK O'CONNELL ISSUES STATEMENT REGARDING HOME SCHOOLING IN CALIFORNIA O'Connell issued the following statement: "Every child in our state has a legal right to get an education, and I want every child to get an education that will prepare them for success in college and the world of work in the challenging global economy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="430">"As the head of California's public school system, I hope that every parent would want to send their children to public school. However, traditional public schools may not be the best fit for every student. Within the public school system there are a range of options available. Students can take independent study classes, attend a charter school, or participate in non-classroom-based programs. But some parents choose to send their children to private schools or to home school, and I respect that right. "I admire the dedication of parents who commit to oversee their children's education through home schooling. But, no matter what educational program a student participates in, it is critical that the program prepares them for future success in the global economy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="431">I urge any parent who is considering or involved in home schooling their children to take advantage of resources and support available through their county or district offices of education." If it passes, it will go to the state Senate for their vote. The call for the Supreme Court to reverse is in the second to last paragraph of the version I have seen. Obviously, this goes against what I have been asking people to do the last week (leave the Supreme Court alone lest we make them mad). However, I believe this resolution is intended to serve much the same function as the HSLDA petition, which is to give a group (here the legislature) the opportunity to do something concrete before the Court completes its review. I believe many in the legislature understand that it is premature to try to introduce legislation until that review is complete and we know what the Court believes the law in California should be based on the statutes we currently have in place. You can find your Assemblymember and his or her contact information by going here , clicking on the blue box entitled "Your Legislature", and entering your zip code.</paragraph><paragraph parID="432">Calls are fine, but letters faxed to the office are even better, as they then retain tangible evidence of their constituents' positions. Emails are often ignored, so please call or fax if possible. It is best to give your name, the city and/or Assembly District you live in and the name of the resolution (ACR 115), to state that you educate your children at home (or support those who do) and wish the right of California families to continue to have that option with minimal government intervention, and to state your desire that Assemblymember ______ vote in favor of ACR 115 by Joel Anderson. If you have any interesting discussions with staff about this resolution, either a strong indication of probable support or opposition, or any other feedback the legal and legislative folks should know about, please tell me about it . CHN has urged us to spread the word about a new resolution, ACR 115, that has been announced by Assemblyman Joel Anderson. If you call, please be calm, straightforward and simple with your support of this resolution. Here is an example:</paragraph><paragraph parID="433">I am a homeschooler in CA, and I urge you to please vote "yes" on Assemblyman Joel Anderson's resolution supporting homeschooling in California. California Assemblyman Joel Anderson is introducing a concurrent resolution in the Assembly. He is calling on the California Supreme Court to reverse the recent court decision that could make homeschooling illegal. This will happen fast, since it's a resolution and not a bill. All California homeschoolers are encouraged to contact their legislators and ask them to support homeschoolers by voting yes on Joel Anderson's ACR supporting homeschooling. We expect there will be a powerful response as California homeschoolers respond. "The misguided action of the Second Appellate Court denies California parents' primary responsibility for their own children's education and violates their special role in raising their children," said Anderson.</paragraph><paragraph parID="434">"We do not need new legislation to resolve this, but simply for the Supreme Court to allow home schooling to continue as it has," said Anderson. As far as I know, there is still an ongoing effort to depublish the appellate court's opinion. I'll post more information about this as it happens. California homeschooling is currently making state and national news, and if you haven't heard about it yet, you will soon. CHN is fielding hundreds of phone calls and even more emails. We want our members to know about this situation because with the sudden media attention, relatives, neighbors, and co-workers will soon be asking if you know that it's now "illegal to homeschool in California." With CHN's help, you'll be able to tell them the entire story, and also tell them that homeschoolers are not breaking the law!</paragraph><paragraph parID="435">The Problem On February 28th, the Second Appellate District in Los Angeles County wrote a ruling against homeschooling. Faced with one homeschooling family with a long history of problems, the court chose to write that all parents do not have a right to homeschool unless the parent has a teaching credential! This ruling may impact all homeschoolers, including those who are enrolled in independent study programs or charters. The court opinion is being taken very seriously. Karen Taylor and Loren Mavromati from CHN have participated in two conference calls this week with the California groups HSC, CHEA, Family Protection Ministry, and Virginia based HSLDA. The groups are cooperating and working closely together as we mutually look for the best resolution for all homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="436">Our Joint Current Opinion The CA state group leaders along with national HSLDA are in agreement that nothing has changed, and it is as legal to homeschool in California today as it was before this ruling. You may hear otherwise in the media, so remain aware and read the latest information at CHN's legal updates page . This is where you can read the actual court document along with commentary. We are updating it daily so that you will have the latest information, and the peace of mind that comes with knowing the important facts. We are also discussing the issue on the CaliforniaHS elist as well as CHN's members only elist, The Grapevine. What is Being Done</paragraph><paragraph parID="437">If the depublish requests are successful, it would be removed from public record, and would not be cited against homeschoolers. We think there's an excellent chance that it will be successful, but if not, we'll continue to defend homeschooling in other ways. All groups are opposed to legislation, unless there is no other option. What Can YOU do? We know the first impulse is to call a legislator, but we ask that you do not do that. Please remember that legislation could lead to restrictions in homeschooling. * CHN has had great success in the past in rallying state homeschoolers at just the right time to make a huge difference.</paragraph><paragraph parID="438">If we notify you and ask for assistance, please respond. * We ask that you encourage your homeschooling friends to join CHN. It's time that every homeschooler in California join a state group, so that we can be as strong as possible in fighting this. We want that list to continue to grow, so that when media members are researching homeschooling, they'll see that thousands of members are on the list. It's impressive now, and we want to make it more so! Even if you choose "no mail", please join the list as a way to increase our numbers. Of course, we'll also welcome you to participate in the daily discussions, as you have time!</paragraph><paragraph parID="439">Volunteers Needed * We need homeschoolers willing to talk to the media. Most reporters want to talk to a typical homeschooler, and some have special requests that can be hard to match up with the kind of homeschooler they want. * It's critical that we carefully monitor legislation this year. If you like internet searches and research, please help. No experience necessary. * We need everyone to stay calm and keep enjoying your homeschooling experience!</paragraph><paragraph parID="440">We know that CHN members can do that! The CHN Legal Defense Fund was established in 2000. CHN has not solicited funds in many years. However, we believe there is now a need, as we prepare to work with attorneys to build a good defense for CHN members. Donations may be sent to: CHN Legal Defense Fund PO Box 402427 Hesperia, CA 92340-2427 Credit card donations may be made online at CHN's online store or calling (800) 327-5339.</paragraph><paragraph parID="441">Thank you for your continued support. Remember, it's time to be fully aware, but it's not time to be afraid. The story hit mainstream media , "sending waves of fear through California's home schooling families." It was only a matter of time before this story hit the big papers. How can they resist the chance to monetize on a story that is so easy to sensationalize? There isn't much new in the article. Since the ruling, and since the article, this is what has happened in California:</paragraph><paragraph parID="442">1) Homeschoolers have NOT been rounded up and sent to prison. There has been no official statement from the CDE or local school districts. 2) Homeschooling still isn't illegal. The laws haven't changed. When we take the emotion out of the equation, there really isn't much to say. Some thoughts on the LA Times article: The second paragraph pretty much sums up the issue, and the article could have stopped there:</paragraph><paragraph parID="443">Advocates for the families vowed to appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court. Enforcement until then appears unlikely, but if the ruling stands, home-schooling supporters say California will have the most regressive law in the nation. Enforcement is not only unlikely, it's impossible. If the judges' ruling is interpreted that all parents who teach through their own private schools at home must have a credential, then what does that mean for all other private schools? There is nothing in the law that says that certain kinds of private schools have one kind of teacher requirement, and others don't. There is no indication in the law that parents who teach their children at home have to have any different credentials than a private school teacher at large private school. One judge mentions that large private schools have a natural self-regulation because of the demands of the parents, but that doesn't exist anywhere in the law.</paragraph><paragraph parID="444">But, according to the law, if homeschoolers are doing something "illegal", aren't all the parents who send their kids to large private schools who don't hire credentialed teachers? If the law says one thing to cover all private school teachers, how does the court decide that one kind of private school teacher is legal and another isn't? That's not in the law. If this were somehow "enforced", and there was a mass round-up of parents, each time they were taken to court, the judge would have to show in the law where it says that the parents are required to have a credential of they are teachers at a private school. Every time a parent wants to see if they are legally educating their children, do they have to get sent to court and assessed by a judge? Obviously not, so who has the jurisidiction to decide which families are legal and which ones aren't? There is nothing in the law that prescribes that.</paragraph><paragraph parID="445">If this ruling were to stand, there would be so many questions that need to be cleared up, it would create a huge snafu for more than just homeschoolers. It does not behoove the state, or the CA educational system, or anyone really, to accept this court's ruling as the correct interpretation of the law. It might be the butter on some individual's toast to "finally" get those pesky homeschoolers, but in reality, this is such a big ruling, it would effect everyone if it stood as is. In fact, I'm not even exactly sure what would be "enforced" if someone were to try and enforce it. Would it be only homeschoolers who enroll in a private school ISP homeschooling program? Or PSA filing families? What about charter school families?</paragraph><paragraph parID="446">What would be the law they are breaking? If something is illegal, it means someone is break the law, right? So what law are we breaking exactly? What are they going to enforce? This is sooooo not over. The Pacific Justice Institute is also quoted in the LA Times article. I am not familiar with this group.</paragraph><paragraph parID="447">What I do know, is that they are not a homeschooling group, they are a family/religious/civil liberties group. I don't know how well they will be able to defend the Long family, but outside support to fight the homeschooling law is another brick in the wall. There is a lot of media about this. I was called this morning and asked to call into a program on NPR where they are discussing the ruling during one of their opinion shows. (If you heard it, send me an email. I couldn't find a link.) CHN and HSC are in contact with law firms who are interested in helping defend our freedoms in California.</paragraph><paragraph parID="448">Because HSLDA has members in CA, they are also doing the same. Individual briefs will likely be written, and requests to "depublish" the report will be submitted. There is no mention of credentials in any part of the private school code. And where exactly does the law place the line between who has to have a credential and who doesn't? If you are in California, have something prepared to say to people who will inevitably ask you about it, since it's coming out in the general media. And it wouldn't hurt to warn your immediate family before they hear it from the tip-of-the-iceberg news reports that focus on the sky falling. The Legality of Homeschooling: Complying with California Law</paragraph><paragraph parID="449">There are as many ways to homeschool as there are homeschooling families, and there are numerous legal options to choose when determining the best educational option for your children. We have prepared the information about legal issues on this site solely for the purpose of providing general information concerning laws applicable to homeschooling. The phrase "Independent Study Program" (ISP), when used by those in the private homeschool community, has applied to situations where one school files a single private school affidavit (PSA) for multiple homeschooling families whose children are enrolled in their school. The recent homeschooling case in Los Angeles has called into question the wisdom of using the ISP term. For reasons explained more fully below, the Christian Home Educators Association of California (CHEA), California Home School Network (CHN), HomeSchool Association of California (HSC), Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA), and Private and Home Educators of California (part of FPM) are jointly making the following recommendations regarding the termination of the use of the term "independent study programs" in the future. We are recommending that the private homeschool community at large, and the leaders of "private independent study programs" in particular, make a change from using the descriptive phrase "private school independent study program" (and its variants - e.g. "ISP", "Private ISP", etc.), and instead use the phrase "Private School Satellite Program" (PSP, with the second "S" purposely eliminated for simplicity). This will make it clear that these private homeschool programs, in which the students' education is provided by or under the direction of their parents, are different from public school ISPs, in which there is an assigned credentialed teacher who directs the students' education while the parents are teachers' aides.</paragraph><paragraph parID="450">This change in terminology DOES NOT affect parents who file an affidavit (PSA) for their own private school where they teach their own children, but will affect the remainder of homeschoolers in private school programs to varying degrees. We are recommending this change because of certain developments in the homeschooling case pending before the California Court of Appeal in Los Angeles. In its brief prepared for the June rehearing, the California Department of Education (CDE) expressed their official position on homeschooling, which calls into question the wisdom of continuing to use the term "ISP" to describe multi-family homeschool programs. It's the CDE's position that the only valid "independent study" programs are those public school home study programs that comply with very specific statutory requirements as outlined in the Education Code. We believe that the term "Private School Satellite Program" accurately describes the operation of a private school that files an affidavit and serves multiple families, whether it be a private campus-based school with a home study option, a school operated as a business exclusively serving homeschoolers, or a private school composed entirely of homeschool families. We hope this brief overview of your options will make the first step of the journey easier. We welcome you as you join us on this exciting voyage.</paragraph><paragraph parID="451">The information in this site is not intended to be legal advice or an advertisement for legal services.

On August 8, 2008, the California Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District ruled that homeschooling is indeed a legal option in California. This was a reversal of a ruling in February of this year that parents must hold a teaching credential to homeschool their children, and confirms HSC's long held interpretation of private school laws.</paragraph><paragraph parID="452">New terms for independent study programs Some programs characterized as ISPs are part of a private school campus-based school, some are operated as a business catering to homeschoolers, and others are composed entirely of homeschoolers. In almost all of these situations, the persons actually teaching the children enrolled in the school are the parents or guardians of the children, with varying degrees of assistance or supervision from the school. If a school has the words "independent study program" as part of its name, we would recommend that the name be changed to eliminate that reference. We are not saying that schools offering this type of program need to incorporate the words "satellite program" as part of their official name, and we leave the selection of the new name to the schools. We do think, though, that it would be prudent to discontinue the use of the "ISP" term. We understand that this creates some hardship and inconvenience for some schools, and assure you that we are not making this recommendation lightly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="453">We also recommend that the administrator of each Private School Satellite Program (formerly ISP) include in their count of teachers on their annual private school affidavit at least one parent or guardian from each family in their Satellite Program (PSP), so that the number of reported teachers more correctly reflects the actual student-teacher ratio. In concert with our recommendation #2 above, we want to remind every Private School Satellite Program administrator to continue to require "a record of educational qualification of each [teacher]" to be maintained at the address specified by the private school on the PSA (see Ed Code 33190(f)(3). The PSA does not ask for the names of teachers, and we do not recommend that any teacher names be given voluntarily. Families who are enrolled in programs that we would now call PSPs do not need to do anything other than confirm with their schools that they are aware of these recommendations. If any school is not aware of them, please feel free to give them a copy of this message and ask them to contact one of the organizations listed above for further information if it is needed. You may wonder why we feel action is needed even though a new, final decision has not yet been issued. We believe they were confused by the ISP name; in order to eliminate that confusion, we're making these recommendations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="454">We would like to note, however, that they did concede that one family can legally operate a private school in their home. In each case, the enrolled family's home is a satellite location of the private school with the parents or guardians operating as the teachers of the children in their homes. We evaluated many different possible terms, researched whether those terms are used in California state laws or the education laws of other states, and determined after lengthy debate that "Private School Satellite Program" both did a good job of describing the situation and avoided any confusion with terms already used in state statutes or regulations. Here is a list of popular homeschool approaches and philosophies. Principle Approach - Using the four "R's" of research, reason, relate, and record this approach is popular among certain Christian homeschoolers who believe America was founded as a Christian nation with a Christian form of government. More thoughtful observers recognize that unschoolers are trying to tend the internal spark and love of learning which many of us had snuffed out by years of compulsory schooling in things which held no meaning or value to us. Reasons to homeschool range the full gamut -- from things to get away from (excessive peer pressure, violence, weak academics) to things to be gained (family unity, freedom, the meeting of special learning needs).</paragraph><paragraph parID="455">We've found it helpful to sort through our motives, define them, and watch them evolve as our homeschool does. We began homeschooling primarily because we were so impressed by the kids in homeschooling families we knew and felt it was a parent's job to educate their children, not the government's. When people ask us now why we homeschool (after being on this course for 12 years) we can honestly say we love being with our kids and wouldn't want to miss a day of their joyful lives. We say that we could never ask even the best classroom teacher to invest in our children the way we can because our kids are precious to us and we would lay our lives down to see them succeed. We tell people that having our kids with us has helped us to grow up, learn to communicate better, and become better people. Obviously, we didn't know at the outset that our motivations would undergo such a transformation.

HSLDA&#146;s own bimonthly magazine, The Home School Court Report, provides news and commentary on a host of current issues affecting homeschoolers. And its two-minute daily radio broadcast, Home School Heartbeat , can be heard on nearly 500 radio stations. HSLDA advocates for the movement by commissioning and presenting quality research on the progress of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="457">Whether it&#146;s in print, from the podium, or on the air, HSLDA provides insightful vision and leadership for the cause of homeschooling. "Homeschoolers were shocked that a court would make such a broad decision without having reached out to at least one of the groups within California or to Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) for input," she said. "We decided on legal strategy during our conference calls and then executed that strategy at our own group levels." "One of the coalition's first concerns," said HSLDA President Mike Smith, "was getting the message out that no new legislation was needed or wanted by California homeschoolers. We believed the better course of action at that point was to pursue all available legal court procedures to get the decision reversed." Impressed by the efficient teamwork of the coalition, HSLDA Litigation Attorney Jim Mason described the many ways the groups got the message out: "FPM coordinated the conference calls related to the legislature, the governor's office, and the department of education. HSC, CHN, and CHEA did an incredible job of educating their members and the media on the issues and preparing to take legislative lobbying action if necessary.</paragraph><paragraph parID="458">HSLDA coordinated the conference calls with the attorneys involved in eventually writing amicus briefs in the Rachel L . "HSLDA has always offered a service to homeschooling families that CHEA cannot offer, and that is legal protection," said Mary Schofield, an attorney and a 15-year board member of CHEA. Debbie Schwarzer, Homeschool Association of California After the court agreed to rehear the case, it became even more crucial for the groups to act as a team, Schwarzer added. "I see [this coalition] as a tremendous opportunity for us to stay connected and stay unified, especially if we have to address the issue of legislation in the future," said HSLDA Chairman Mike Farris. The court of appeal agreed to rehear the case on March 25, at the request of attorneys for the children's father. Interested organizations on both sides of the issue were urged to file amicus, or "friend-of-court" briefs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="459">But because the final ruling would be made by the same three judges who had rendered the initial Rachel L . decision, homeschoolers knew they would need top-notch legal advice. "We shared information and decided who would do what on which brief," Schwarzer said. Then, nearly seven weeks later, on August 8, the court reversed its initial ruling in Rachel L . It declared that homeschooling under the private school statute was indeed legally permissible in California. HSLDA, FPM, and the three California homeschooling groups held their final Rachel L . conference call-this time, a jubilant one-after the ruling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="460">"This decision is great news for homeschooling parents in California," Schofield said. "Homeschooling works, and the court is right in recognizing that the legislature allows this. That's a huge burden lifted, not to worry about it being illegal." "We forget that we all have one thing in common-we want our basic right to homeschool to stay legal. A few months ago, California home educators found themselves facing an unexpected "check" in the home-schooling chess game. But by banding together, they successfully declared "checkmate"-and helped reverse In re Rachel L . , a decision by the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District in Los Angeles that could have had devastating consequences for homeschooling families around the country.</paragraph><paragraph parID="461">"That allowed the court to see a few very well-written briefs from the joint state groups and from HSLDA, [which] represented a huge proportion of California homeschoolers." Of the 16 briefs that were filed, 14 supported the interpretation of the law that allowed homeschoolers this option. All insist that even though homeschooling is now safeguarded under California law, it's imperative that home educators around the country stay informed through their statewide organizations and become a part of the work effort to maintain homeschooling in a positive light. Homeschooling in New Jersey - "Are you allowed to do that?" Although homeschooling has never not been legal in NJ, many school districts were unaware of this, and it wasn't until 1965 that a court case upheld our right to provide our children with a non institutional education. Another case , two years later, settled the question of "equivalent instruction", saying that we had only to provide education in the major subject areas. The major subject areas are math, English, science, health and fitness, social studies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="462">There are no requirements for testing, curricular content, teaching methods, socialization, lesson plans, logs or reports, lists of goals or objectives, or teaching credentials. The courts have decided that homeschoolers bear the burden of proving that they are not truant. If your district demands more than the law requires, print out and send to them a copy of the 2000 booklet "Frequently Asked Questions About Homeschooling in New Jersey". A fully inclusive advocacy group dedicated to preserving our freedom to home educate our children. There's been some discussion as to whether or not we are now required to add a foreign language, since public schools are required to provide this, but this has not been settled, nor have homeschoolers been challenged on this matter. Since most homeschooling families do learn world languages, this is not an issue. Homeschoolers are not required to use textbooks.</paragraph><paragraph parID="463">NJHA recommends that you send a notification letter if: you are removing children from school OR the district questions your children's status OR the district claims that your children are truant. A notification letter need only say that your children are receiving their education via homeschooling. Other than names and your family's address, no other information is required. Some homeschoolers choose to send a notification letter as a courtesy, or in anticipation of a district's charges of truancy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="464">No district may "require" such notification from homeschoolers. Once the district has been apprised that the issue is homeschooling, not truancy, and that the parents are providing an education, the burden of proof shifts to the district. If they are dissatisfied with any aspect of the homeschooling, they must prove in court that the child is being educationally deprived. This burden is so great, and the 1965 and 1967 court decisions so protective, that few districts, even the most hostile, are willing to attempt it (especially at taxpayer expense.) Some districts have asked for or demanded more from homeschooling families than the laws require us to provide to them. This is available online at Homeschoolers who refuse to be intimidated do eventually wear down the resistance of districts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="465">Homeschoolers who bow to pressure and allow districts to mandate requirements beyond the law have the effect of creating more problems for other homeschoolers, and strengthen the resolve of hostile administrators to harass homeschoolers within their districts. Every parent, guardian or other person having custody and control of a child between the ages of six and 16 years shall cause such child regularly to attend the public schools of the district or a day school in which there is given instruction equivalent to that provided in the public schools for children of similar grades and attainments or to receive equivalent instruction elsewhere than at school. Such regular attendance shall be during all the days and hours that the public schools are in session in the district, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the board of education of the district that the mental condition of the child is such that he cannot benefit from instruction in the school or that the bodily condition of the child is such as to prevent his attendance at school, but nothing herein shall be construed as permitting the temporary or permanent exclusion from school by the board of education of any district of any child between the ages of five and 20, except as explicitly otherwise provided by law.

In a rare moment of reassessment, the Court of Appeal for the Second Appellate District in Los Angeles, California, recently reversed its February opinion, which formerly held that parents who did not hold a teaching credential could not legally homeschool their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="469">By ruling that the teacher certification provision was the only legal option for homeschooling in California, the court declared the family involved was acting illegally regarding their children's education. Though these words could be said of any number of matters in which Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) has been involved, they take on special significance in light of the fact that Kreep is a founder of the United States Justice Foundation (USJF) and one of the attorneys representing the father involved in In re Rachel L. , the recent case so troubling to homeschoolers in California. But thanks to USJF, the Alliance Defense Fund (ADF), and the involvement of HSLDA, In re Rachel L. is no longer a threat to home education. United States Justice Foundation -When USJF Executive Director Gary Kreep became part of the L. family's legal team, he asked HSLDA to assist in the landmark homeschooling case. Though it joins a slim minority of cases that are reheard and reversed, In re Rachel L. (now In re Jonathan L. ) is more than a testimony to judicial humility. It also serves to showcase the incredible timing and hand of Providence in the unique way a successful defense of homeschooling, which so eloquently influenced the justices of the court, was brought together. HSLDA had the opportunity to play a crucial role in the reversal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="470">By the time the same court of appeal judges issued a reversal of their original decision on August 8, 2008, Rachel was no longer living in the home and was no longer part of the case, so the new decision bore the next name on the original dependency petition: In re Jonathan L., et al. In this issue of the Court Report , you'll see our authors using all these names. The name In re Rachel L. refers to the original bad decision. The name In re Jonathan L. refers to the court's reversal of that decision. And "the California case" can refer to either-the context will make the meaning clear. While much has been written in the media and by HSLDA regarding this case, its facets, and the action being taken, very little has been disclosed about the way HSLDA was enabled to serve the homeschooling community behind the scenes in defending the rights of parents to educate their children. The legal cooperation between ADF, USJF, and HSLDA could not be publicly reported until after the conclusion of the case.</paragraph><paragraph parID="471">The Brick Wall When the original decision of In re Rachel L. came down, HSLDA leapt into action-a hard job when the only course of action left is trying to bat clean up for something that comes as a complete surprise and is over before people know what has happened. According to HSLDA President Mike Smith, because the case was a juvenile dependency case and, therefore, the court records were sealed, the organization had no idea homeschooling was being threatened in California until the original decision was handed down by the court on February 28. "A decision like that will become precedent for every other homeschool family in California," Smith said, categorizing HSLDA's initial reaction as one of "shock" and "go into action." His conservative estimate is that the ruling would have impacted some 166,000 children and their families in the state. HSLDA/Daniel Noa County of Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services -The Rachel L. Case began as a Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services investigation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="472">Jim Mason, HSLDA's senior counsel and litigation attorney, who helped write the petition for rehearing eventually submitted, agreed with Smith. "We knew the court had overlooked critical statutes, but couldn't do anything to help because we didn't represent the family," Mason said. All of the HSLDA staff realized how potentially devastating the ruling could be to the homeschooling community in California. "The first thing that came to mind was that when a court overlooks critical statutes, you can petition for rehearing," Mason said. In this case, that oversight was of "monumental proportion," according to Mason. To fight the ruling with a petition for rehearing appeared to be the most logical and the only available course of action for HSLDA. "But in order to file for rehearing, you have to be a party to the case, and we were not the family's attorney.</paragraph><paragraph parID="473">We'd come up against a brick wall," Mason said. "With only 15 days allowed by the court to file such a motion, we just found no way to do it." By the end of the first week of media spotlight on the ruling, "we had talked to everyone we could think of to get a petition for rehearing filed," he continued. In addition to the following public faces who stood for homeschooling during the crisis, it's important to recognize the state leaders who lobbied to keep Congress from instituting a federal "solution" to In re Rachel L. And underlying all of the hard work of these individuals and organizations were the prayers of thousands of homeschooling families in California and around the country. Alliance Defense Fund (ADF) Gary McCaleb, Senior Counsel Jeff Shafer, Senior Legal Counsel Timothy Chandler, Legal Counsel California Homeschool Network (CHN) Loren Mavromati, President Karen Taylor, Trustee Christian Home Educators Association of California (CHEA) Mary Schofield, Board Member</paragraph><paragraph parID="474">HomeSchool Association of California (HSC) Debbie Schwarzer, Legal Co-chair Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) Mike Farris, Chairman Mike Smith, President Jim Mason, Senior Counsel Darren Jones, Staff Attorney Private &amp; Home Educators of California, a program of Family Protection Ministries (FPM) Roy Hanson, Founder &amp;amp; Executive Director Jim Davis, Legislative Liaison United States Justice Foundation (USJF) Gary Kreep, Executive Director HSLDA had already been in contact with the three California membership organizations-Christian Home Educators Association of California, California Homeschool Network, and HomeSchool Association of California-as well as with Private &amp; Home Educators of California, a branch of Family Protection Ministries. "This is a legal procedure which allows any person to ask the court to, in essence, say that the appeal court ruling wouldn't be binding on everyone in California-just the family involved in the particular case," Mason said. While there is no formal record of all the attorneys involved in In re Rachel L. , legal briefs and interviews allow us to approximate at least 67 attorneys involved in the case, with a breakdown of the figures below.</paragraph><paragraph parID="475">Taking into account local and out-of-state travel, long distance conference calls, and attorneys' regular and overtime hours (billable at $200-$500/hour), the costs of the case might have reached seven figures, had it not been for the graciousness of the many firms that volunteered pro bono assistance. According to Farris, the latter, constitutional half, which he prepared, focused on parental rights rather than religious freedom, since the court's first decision was sweeping enough to include secular and Christian homeschoolers alike. In creating a constitutional argument in favor of parental rights, he endeavored to cater to the record as well as help all homeschooling families involved, not just religious families. But they were no guarantee that a court which had made up its mind to denounce homeschooling as illegal was going to admit its error and offer to rehear the case. Between the court's acceptance of the petition for rehearing and oral arguments, HSLDA's Farris, Mason, and Smith worked closely with the father's legal team, especially ADF's Tim Chandler, Jeff Shafer, and Gary McCaleb. Not only did they collaborate on the father's "rebriefing," but they also coauthored numerous procedural legal documents that needed to be filed. The goal was to convince the court that "they didn't have to decide whether homeschooling was legal in order to rule that in a proper case, where the children are at risk, the court has the authority to override the parents' constitutional right to homeschool their children," Mason said.</paragraph><paragraph parID="476">In response, HSLDA quickly drafted a supplemental letter brief for the father's legal team to file, explaining the impropriety of the attorney's introduction of the new material during oral arguments and responding to the statutes in question. "If you decide that the statute allows homeschooling, there's no need to go into the constitutional arguments," Farris said. Mason, who focused on the statutory side of the brief, contended that homeschooling falls, as HSLDA has long argued, under the private school exemption in California compulsory attendance law. Because California does not have an explicit homeschooling law, home educators file with private "umbrella" schools-private schools with homeschooling programs-or parents file an affidavit with the state establishing a private school within their home. Mason argued that the statute "requires 'the owner or other head ' of the private school to file an affidavit" and that a 1986 amendment clarified the requirement for " ' every person , firm, association, partnership, or corporation offering or conducting private school instruction' annually to file an affidavit" (emphasis added). While it may seem rather obvious to some, the court overlooked or failed to consider that the legislature worded it broadly enough to include non-traditional private schools and their administrators, and that those administrators might include individual persons in addition to firms, associations, etc. It was a simple and literal translation of the statute, with a huge impact on home education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="477">The only evidence relied on by the court for its condemnation of homeschooling in the original ruling was the private school statutes and several cases unfavorable to homeschooling. These cases, which included People v. Turner (1953) and In re Shinn (1961), "suggest very definitely that homeschooling under private school exemption is not allowed," Mason said. But these do not apply to homeschools, as Mason was able to clearly point out in the wording of the statute which he quotes: "does not include any private school in which education is primarily conducted in private homes." Though the arguments might seem minor and gathered from various odds and ends of California Codes, they were tried and true defenses used by HSLDA over the years to protect home education in California. Then, those representing the many organizations in favor of homeschooling spoke. Mike Farris did a tremendous job laying out the weight of homeschooling in California and nationally." Sitting there, Mason was completely taken off guard when one of the opposing attorneys presented a list of statutes to the court, arguing that they restricted homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="478">Rather than being anti-homeschooling, the codes actually referenced exemptions for homeschools. For now, the future of homeschooling in California remains, as it has been thus far, permitted by implicit legislative recognition but unhindered by any explicit laws from the state other than those private school statutes home educators currently operate under. A not-so-bright IDEA A provision in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) raises a legal issue important to all parents who are homeschooling special needs children. This federal act gives grants to public schools so they can provide disabled children with a free education suited to their needs. In order for the schools to receive these grants, IDEA's Child Find provision requires them to identify, locate, and evaluate children who may be eligible for services. This evaluation can create problems for homeschoolers. Public schools sometimes find themselves in a confusing position when it comes to dealing with homeschoolers who have special needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="479">Although no federal or state law requires schools to evaluate children whose parents do not want them to receive public services, some schools think they must conduct evaluations of every child in their district, whether or not the children's parents want them to receive public school services. Why do schools persist in their efforts to evaluate children whose parents turn down the offer? "There are two reasons," says HSLDA Litigation Attorney James Mason. If your child needs professional help, HSLDA recommends that you use private services. While these services can be costly, we encourage you to take advantage of them and remain free from government oversight. (See HSLDA's brochure, Homeschooling Your Special Needs Child , at www.hslda.org/hs/specialneeds for creative ideas on finding affordable private services.) "One, a federal law states that a school can be held liable for damages if it fails in its Child Find duties (that is, if it fails to locate a special needs child or offer him services).</paragraph><paragraph parID="480">Two, IDEA has been misinterpreted as requiring schools to conduct evaluations regardless of the wishes of parents." "HSLDA is litigating this issue in two cases, one in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals." Through the individualized attention of homeschooling, many diligent parents have prepared their special needs children for future endeavors at home and at work. Tom Bushnell says that children with special needs teach us perseverance. Grief is inevitable for parents who find out their child has a disability, but with God's help, they can cope with their child's needs, helping him grow to his fullest potential. As Mary Hernandez says, "It gets difficult at times, but overall, you're really doing better when you see the outcome. You see your kids growing in homeschooling, and you hear the smart things they say and the smart things they do.</paragraph><paragraph parID="481">Then you feel, 'Oh, I could do it another year."' Homeschooling our special needs children also adds a spiritual dimension to their education. "We have our children's hearts," says Sherry Bushnell. "We are giving our children a spiritual foundation that they would not receive in public school." Whether you're considering homeschooling or just getting started, press on. Many parents have gone before you and are seeing their children learn and succeed. Sherry Bushnell, homeschooling mother of twelve (four of whom are disabled) and co-director along with her husband Tom of the National Challenged Homeschoolers Associated Network (NATHHAN), says she has been encouraged through one-on-one contact with other homeschooling parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="482">At home, Mary holds Raul to a structured school schedule, but also involves him in household routines. The idea of being completely responsible for a child's education is daunting for any parent, but especially so for those whose children require specialized care or training. Terri Dowty, a homeschooling mother and editor of Home Educating Our Autistic Spectrum Children: Paths Are Made by Walking , writes, "Home education allows a child to form relationships with anyone he or she chooses, at a manageable pace and within a real, mixed community." First, parents should familiarize themselves with state law. It is legal to homeschool a child with special needs. The First and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution protect that right. However, many states have their own homeschooling laws, some of which may create difficulties for parents of special needs children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="483">Visit our website at www.hslda.org for information about your state's homeschooling laws. For help in understanding your state's requirements, Home School Legal Defense Association members are welcome to contact our legal department. Joyce Herzog, author of Choosing and Using Curriculum , recommends that parents with special needs children choose curriculum that is "orderly, bite-sized . . . relevant to [the child's] life and taught in a comfortable multi-sensory environment." It may take a period of trial and error before you find the right balance-and even then, it will shift to meet the varying needs of your growing, changing child." By identifying your child's disability, learning about its effects, and exploring how you can help your child succeed, you will find yourself focusing on what your child can do instead of what he can't . When Mary first began homeschooling, one of her sisters, whose son had graduated from high school as a homeschooler, shared her experiences with Mary and encouraged her in her new venture. "Although homeschooling is legal, it is an educational alternative that many government officials don't really understand," says HSLDA President J. Michael Smith.</paragraph><paragraph parID="484">"This lack of understanding can lead to significant legal problems. Over the last 22 years, HSLDA has advocated for hundreds of special needs families. We've found that families can take some preventative steps to avoid legal difficulties and keep them from escalating." First, Smith advises parents, document your child's progress. If you are investigated for educational neglect, an SEP and subsequent evaluations will provide an invaluable defense. HSLDA members may contact Special Needs Coordinator Betty Statnick for specialist referrals or visit www.hslda.org to see sample evaluation forms. Once the school has identified the child's abilities and needs, an Individualized Education Plan is created, listing the child's academic needs and outlining a strategy to meet them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="485">Since 1983, Home School Legal Defense Association&#146;s primary goal has remained the same&#151;to bring together a large number of homeschooling families so that each can have a low-cost method of obtaining quality legal defense. However, in practice, we have come to the aid of our members and many non-members to protect and advance the right of all to homeschool. HSLDA gives families the freedom to homeschool without having to face legal threats alone. Through many families sticking together, we have been able to keep the cost of a year&#146;s membership close to the rate that you would have to pay for an hour of an attorney&#146;s time almost anywhere else. After a family joins HSLDA, there are no further charges of any kind for defending them in court. HSLDA pays in full all attorney fees, expert witness costs, travel expenses, and all other court costs permissible by state law for us to pay. The vast majority of contacts member families face are successfully resolved through our early intervention without any court action.</paragraph><paragraph parID="486">Many times HSLDA attorneys call or write letters on behalf of members contacted by local officials. For those who wind up in court, HSLDA provides full representation at every stage of legal proceedings. We defend your future liberty As a member, you not only receive numerous tangible benefits, but you also receive the intangible and invaluable blessing of defending liberty for future generations. Your membership not only works to further your right to homeschool now, but through you, countless other families will enjoy these same liberties as they seek to homeschool their own children in future generations. Other valuable benefits In addition to professional legal representation for your homeschooling, we also provide the following benefits for our members.</paragraph><paragraph parID="487">Online Curriculum Market where you can save a lot of money buying and selling homeschool-related materials and books. Anyone can sell, but only HSLDA Members may purchase items (and it's free). Weekly Updates and e-lerts that call our members to action. You&#146;ll receive email e-lerts on local, state, national, and international homeschooling issues. We will tell you what&#146;s happening, what it means to you, and what you can do about it. The HSLDA PerX program , offering members Xtra benefits that are substantial and practical. You can receive discounts on home and auto insurance, school supplies, hotel reservations, and much more.</paragraph><paragraph parID="488">Our PerX program offers members Xtra benefits that are substantial and practical. Access to HSLDA's Homeschooling Thru High School Program: Two high school coordinators are available to our members for personal consultations regarding questions about homeschooling through high school. When HSLDA takes a case, there are no further charges of any kind to the family. HSLDA pays in full all attorney fees, expert witness fees, court transcript cost, travel expenses, and all other court costs permissible by state law for us to pay. We offer a discount to families who are members of a participating discount group, a full-time pastor, full-time missionary, or active/retired/disabled military. (See Group Discounts for a discount group that will work for you. If you are the leader of a group and want to participate, please call or email HSLDA.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="489">We also run special promotions at various times. Despite society&#146;s doubt and skepticism, homeschoolers have become a significant demographic in America with impressive, consistent academic achievement and post-graduate success. HSLDA has initiated research and compiled statistical evidence of homeschool achievement in conjunction with the National Home Education Research Institute. You can access the results of these studies at http://www.hslda.org/research/default.asp . When Diane and Mary were planning the contents and form for the workshop, they agreed to put the curriculum, legalities and academic parts at the end. In the actual presentation, however, the topics on most participants&#65533; minds were academics, legalities and curriculum. People really wanted to know: &#65533;Is it legal to do it?</paragraph><paragraph parID="490">While these questions kept popping up like mushrooms, it became clear why Diane and Mary did not want to spend most of the session talking about the legalities and curriculum &#65533; because all of us who have been &#65533;homeschooling&#65533; for any length of time know that homeschooling is not truly a verb. Most of these people formed our keynote montage, wherein each presenter was asked to speak for five minutes about homeschooling. In the beginning they wanted to share their experience of homeschooling and talk about the real issues first &#65533; such as what a typical week was really like; covering the &#65533;S&#65533; word (socialization); to tell the audience their particular stories; and Mary likes to begin a workshop by asking the participants what they would like to get out of it. Throughout the first portion of the workshop, people kept asking questions like &#65533;When you homeschool, what time do you do it? In the middle of that session, Mary realized that every time she experiences problems as a homeschooling parent, it is caused by thinking of homeschooling as something one does , rather than as a way of living. When we stop and think about the most important aspects of homeschooling -- of keeping our kids at home, being 100% parents, developing a living relationship with our children and creating an environment that we are in charge of&#65533; -- the academics fade into the background. I answered, "If rights are based on man-made documents they are not rights, they are privileges.</paragraph><paragraph parID="491">What man makes, man can change." Thus, there is no such right in a God-based theory of rights. What is HSLDA&#146;s position on homeschool students&#146; use of special education and related services benefits through the public schools? Special education refers to instruction or assistance in traditional academic areas such as math, language arts, etc. The caseworker informed the family that she had received a report that they were homeschooling and she needed to investigate for possible education neglect. When asked if their children were enrolled as homeschoolers with the Indiana Department of Education (DOE), Mrs. Olsen stated they were not. As she left the caseworker insisted that they were required to enroll their children and that her investigation would not be closed until they did so.</paragraph><paragraph parID="492">Realizing they needed help to resolve this situation, the Olsens contacted the Home School Legal Defense Association for help. Staff Attorney Thomas Schmidt attempted to contact the caseworker to explain what Indiana law requires. Under Indiana law, homeschool parents must keep attendance records. On the DOE website there is an "Enrollment Report Form" that the Superintendent of Public Instruction requests that parents fill out if they decide to homeschool their children. Indiana law does allow the state superintendent to request the number of students by grade level attending the school. However, this request is to be made directly to homeschool program by the state superintendent. Schmidt was able to contact the attorney for CPS and discuss these issues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="493">HSLDA advises parents that they can, but are not required to, enroll with the DOE. When removing a child from the public school in the middle of the year, it may be a good idea to enroll with the DOE. If homeschooling is an issue, we will represent our member families until the issue is resolved. On Fourth Amendment unreasonable search and seizure issues, HSLDA will advise our members whenever the privacy of their home is violated by forced or coerced entry for the purpose of an unsubstantiated investigation. HSLDA membership benefits do not extend to court actions resulting from non-homeschooling matters. However, in circumstances where there is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment, HSLDA may, as we have done in the past, choose to take the case in an effort to establish legal precedent. Mr. and Mrs. Olsen (name changed to protect privacy) were homeschooling their children in Tippecanoe County when they were contacted by their local Department of Child Services.</paragraph><paragraph parID="494">While these records can be requested by the state superintendent, the purpose is only to "verify the enrollment and attendance of the particular child." The attorney agreed that enrollment was not required and promised that the case would be closed. It's a huge geographical challenge for our state. We try to pull these leaders aside twice a year. We want to focus on mentoring new leaders, as well being mindful of the whole realm of other church and family responsibilities these leaders have. I see the effort to promote homeschooling and to keep it safe as a team effort between HSLDA and the state organizations. In the fall we have a big meeting, and that's really for full-day work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="495">State organizations serve the homeschooling community tremendously by providing instruction, encouragement, and training through symposiums, conferences, and conventions. By providing speakers that teach the principles of liberty and the importance of advancing homeschool freedoms, state organizations offer an invaluable service to parents. - J. Michael Smith Every day, hundreds of thousands of committed mothers and fathers selflessly devote themselves to the task of teaching their children at home. Free from the strictures of government bureaucracy and standardization, these parents create positive learning environments that engage their children's learning styles and respect their individuality. For Christian parents, the most appealing benefit of homeschooling is the ability to incorporate their faith and convictions into the educational process. At the end of the day, their children's faith in God has been affirmed, their worldview strengthened, and their family life enriched.</paragraph><paragraph parID="496">Like a diamond, the beauty of homeschooling is truly multi-faceted. Homeschooling parents are, by definition and necessity, an independent lot. They are pioneers in the frontiers of parent-directed education. And, yet, during the course of the last 20 years, these same parents have astutely perceived the need to band together to form extremely successful state homeschooling organizations. Christopher Klicka, senior counsel for HSLDA observes: It is important for individual families to be involved with their state organizations so that homeschoolers have solidarity throughout the state. As Benjamin Franklin said, "If we do not hang together, we shall most assuredly hang separately!"</paragraph><paragraph parID="497">Susan Beatty, co-founder, board member, and Communications Director for Christian Home Education Association of California, says, "State organizations promote camaraderie. When we band together, we can make our voices heard." According to tradition, when the eighteenth century composer Franz Joseph Haydn attended the Westminster Abbey performance of the Hallelujah Chorus, he "stood with the crowd, wept and exclaimed, 'He is the Master of us all.'" (Oxford Companion, 5th Ed.) For many years I have viewed HSLDA as the Air Force and state homeschooling organizations as the Army. - Michael P. Farris State organizations have, in many respects, become choirs for the homeschooling movement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="498">When we join our voices together, we create a quality musical performance that cannot be duplicated by one or two voices singing alone. By joining the choir, homeschooling parents don't surrender their individuality or personal convictions and responsibilities. When we, as Christian home educators, join our voices together, we should desire for our communities to be so moved by the power and emotion of the music that they exclaim with Haydn, "He is the Master of us all." Overall, slightly less than one-half (48%) of homeschoolers consider themselves to be involved in some way with a state homeschooling organization . . . Those homeschoolers not involved with a state organization, 52% of the total, indicated that they were not involved for a number of reasons. Legislators and other government officials know that state organizations represent the voices of thousands of homeschooling families when they speak," says Dewitt Black, Senior Counsel for HSLDA. In "Serving Homeschoolers at the State Level," HSLDA asked members the following question: "What activity of state organizations is the most important?" Dewitt Black worked alongside state leaders to help defeat this threatening legislation by activating HSLDA e-lerts and by traveling to South Carolina to testify before the Senate Education Committee.</paragraph><paragraph parID="499">The day features a luncheon, outstanding student presentations, instructions for effective lobbying, and opportunities for homeschooling families to meet with their legislators. Helping new homeschoolers Kevin Swanson, Executive Director of Christian Educators of Colorado (CHEC), believes that "helping new homeschoolers get started is the heart and soul of CHEC's ministry." We go straight to the heart of homeschooling, which includes individualized, parent-directed programs, freedom from government control, and Christ-centeredness. We bring in top speakers and curriculum vendors as a service to our parents." For the past two years, attendance at the Pennsylvania homeschooling convention has exceeded 8,000 people. Kim said that each year the Pennsylvania convention attracts a large number of new homeschoolers. Kim believes that state organizations should host annual conventions for three reasons: to provide information, encouragement, and rejuvenation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="500">The South Carolina Association of Independent Homeschools (SCAIHS) devotes large amounts of time to collecting information on available resources and field trips for homeschooling families. This type of technology is especially helpful to state organizations who do not have paid staff members to handle large volumes of phone calls. Websites provide a vehicle for immediately putting necessary information into the hands of their members and new homeschoolers, without having to invest large chunks of volunteers' time in phone calls. Providing encouragement and support State homeschooling organizations exist to serve the homeschooling community. Whether the task at hand is putting on a state conference or stopping bad legislation, these servant-leaders have given of themselves to help families teach their own children in their own homes. In the Netherlands home education is currently not a legal option. Many more families would like to home-educate their children but are not able to get their way without years filled with court cases and child protection investigations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="501">HSLDA immediately sent out an elert to its member families urging them to call the Netherlands Embassy in Washington, D.C., and to write to the Dutch Education Committee, in order to explain that homeschooling works. While the Education Committee granted the Minister of Education the authority to develop legislation for the inspection of homeschooling, we believe that homeschoolers accomplished a major victory for the following reasons: first, we delayed any immediate efforts to regulate homeschooling (though there may be upcoming battles), secondly, the Education Committee has been informed about homeschooling as an issue. Most Members of Parliament did not think the issue was very important because it only effects 50 families that are legally homeschooling. Homeschooling was recently targeted by the Ministry of Education, but a quick response by Dutch homeschoolers and homeschoolers around the world accomplished an important victory. Homeschooling parents may try to get an exemption from school registration, but only for deeply felt religious or philosophical reasons. However, these exemptions are recognized with great reluctance, for children are not considered to be educated effectively without public school attendance. Once a child has attended a school even this option is barred.</paragraph><paragraph parID="502">Now only the parents of about a 100 children have been able to avoid this trap to secure their freedom. In an attempt to regulate homeschooling even further, Maria van der Hoeven, the Dutch Minister of Education, proposed a plan to restrict homeschooling to the Education Committee of the Dutch House of Representatives on October 30, 2003. Homeschoolers sent thousands of emails to the various Ministers of Parliament and HSLDA sent Dutch homeschoolers a package of materials to assist in their lobbying efforts. Third, Dutch homeschoolers were able to make some good contacts with Ministers who are sympathetic to homeschooling and this will be vital for any future battles for homeschool freedom. Dutch homeschool groups will continue to develop relationships with Ministers and lobby for easing the restrictions on homeschooling. Debbie Schwarzer, co-chair of the legal team for HomeSchool Association of California: My initial reaction was, how could all of us not have heard about this? HSLDA's immediate strategy was to petition the Supreme Court to "depublish" the opinion, in other words, to prevent the decision from being applied to all California homeschoolers and being used as legal precedent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="503">Dan Andrus, homeschooling dad: My first reaction was basically to get to the bottom of it, to take it with a grain of salt. I wanted to find out all the details and not jump to any conclusions. My other reaction was just disbelief that homeschooling could be made illegal that quickly. As co-chair of HSC's legal team, Debbie Schwarzer emphasizes that "homeschooling is not a partisan issue." She and her husband, Fred, homeschool their two sons in Los Altos, California. Grace Andrus, mayor of Crescenta Valley Town Council, California, and homeschooling mom: I'm an elected official in my community-I'm elected to the town council and I'm serving my second term as council president/mayor, so I work very closely with the Los Angeles County Board Supervisor Michael Antonovich. I actually got an email from his field deputy and also one from him, saying that they had heard the news and were wondering how this would affect us.</paragraph><paragraph parID="504">And how could the court possibly do that? The court's judgment of all homeschoolers based on one family and one case is not correct. Roy Hanson, director of Private and Home Educators of California: My first thought was how come nobody knew this was going on? It's 180 degrees from where we've been heading all these years of working in California. It is a blow, but we began to immediately work on it. Marcia Neill, homeschooling mom and director of St. Michael the Archangel Academy Private School: I called Pat Ramirez [legal assistant to Mike Smith] immediately. And then I sent an email to all the families who participate in our academy's classes, saying functions were normal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="505">I had felt for a long time that we homeschool because it's a mission from God, to promote the family and protect the family and the parent's right to educate their children. This is an attack, but we're going to win. Courtesy of Mary Schofield "Homeschooling is not going to end," emphasizes CHEA Vice President Mary Schofield. Mary Schofield, vice president of Christian Home Educators Association of California: I was shocked, just like everyone else. It just seemed to come out of nowhere. Usually, we hear when these issues are going on.</paragraph><paragraph parID="506">But it was a juvenile dependency matter and those are confidential-if someone doesn't choose to communicate with us, we have no way of knowing. It was kind of a rude awakening. I've worked in homeschool legal issues for 10 years and when I first read the opinion I was bewildered by the judge's bizarre reasoning. It was very clear that he wanted to reach a result and then he was going to structure the argument that was going to help him reach that result. Know the law firsthand, CHN Vice President Karen Taylor advises parents. Karen Taylor, vice president of California Homeschool Network: I immediately realized that we had a serious problem on our hands, and that we needed to mobilize quickly. I was not afraid to continue to homeschool or go out in public.</paragraph><paragraph parID="507">Homeschooling is just too huge a movement, and we have the support of the public and the media, so I was not worried about homeschooling becoming illegal. However, we want to continue to be able to homeschool using California's private school option, and that could be at risk. California Homeschool Network is doing everything we can to ensure that that option stays viable. We asked everyone who wanted to protect homeschooling to sign an online petition supporting depublication. In just 10 days, over 250,000 people signed. Although the court's decision to rehear the case means that we no longer need to pursue depublication, your signatures are a strong testament to the public support for homeschool freedom. In the weeks following the decision, HSLDA's phone lines were humming with calls from homeschoolers and non-homeschoolers wanting to know more about the California situation and what they could do to help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="508">Call volume peaked on March 7, 2008, following Dr. James Dobson's Focus on the Family radio interview that day with HSLDA Chairman Mike Farris regarding the ruling."We're going to have to feel out the best way to handle these calls today," HSLDA President Mike Smith told staff members early on the day Farris' interview aired.</paragraph></documents>
