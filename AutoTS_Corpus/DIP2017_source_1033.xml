  <paragraph parID="0">She spent a year observing the work of a neighborhood association that dramatically improved parent involvement in nine schools in a predominantly Hispanic Chicago neighborhood. Since, 1995, the Logan Square Neighborhood Association's Parent Mentor Program has trained more than 1,300 parents to serve as classroom assistants for struggling students. The activities that schools design aren't always accessible, convenient or even, frankly, that interesting to parents. LSNA's Parent Mentor Program starts with two weeks of intensive training that continues for two hours a week throughout the school year. How important is the training to the success of the program? The training is essential because it allows parents to see how their individual participation is connected to the broader issues of the school. Parents come into this experience thinking about how they can support their own children, and they leave the experience understanding that they are actually supporting the larger missions of the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">They are reading with children who have fallen behind, they are informal mentors or confidants to kids who are troubled, and they are able to invite other parents to events and activities because they know their children. The training also allows parents to think about the ways that their work in schools can lead to their own individual and personal transformation, so that, by supporting students in the classroom, they then want to be more powerful role models. Sometimes that means that they are motivated to get their GED, to finally take that step signing up for ESL classes, and to find ways to be involved in the larger community. They might participate in an affordable housing campaign or a rally in support of immigration reform. These training sessions are really connecting the parents to the issues of community life which they find are fundamentally connected to the issues of education. But I have to say, many of the schools that now partner with LSNA are schools that might not have warmed up to the idea from the very beginning, but over time, as school leaders have found [LSNA's] work to be compelling and the shifts in parent involvement dramatic - that alone has sparked their curiosity. Good community organizations already have relationships with residents or parents of families in the neighborhood.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">They often understand the language, they understand the cultural norms, they know about the familial experiences. And this is all the kind of information that schools often lack themselves. I worry that when schools try to bring in programs in like this, without the expertise of community partners, that they'll bring in the technical aspects of the program but leave that hierarchical relationship to families intact. [Schools tend to] think about how they can offer services to families, "How can we change them?" Community organizations know and appreciate the talents families can bring. That's how you create a model [for parent involvement] that's different. You have to really believe that parents have something vital to offer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">Take-home learning activities and close monitoring of their use can be effective strategies for the home-school team in supporting academic achievement of students. However, it takes a lot of time to prepare these activities, time that is usually spent by teachers preparing for their classes (Garc&#237;a, 1990). Involving parents in the educational scene requires additional time that teachers may not have due to increased state academic requirements and related paperwork. Moles (1993) suggests adding a parent-liaison staff member to the schools to help teachers prepare activities and relieve them from other responsibilities. In most places, fiscal shortages often threaten new school initiatives; in these cases, reallocation of resources becomes the only way to support newly identified needs. Experience has shown, though, that for parental involvement to become a reality, administrators have to make it a funding priority. Inadequate resources translate into inappropriate materials and a lack of training for staff and parents, both essential components of successful home-school collaborations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">Many school-based barriers can block the progress of efforts to establish contact with culturally and linguistically diverse homes and, likewise, stand in the way of parents responding positively to the school's efforts. A Study of Teacher Attributes Related to Parent Involvement Positive teacher attitudes about parental roles in the schools are essential attributes for the success of parent involvement programs. Generally, mutual misunderstanding and distrust are what keep homes and schools from working together. The nature and extent of teacher practices are important predictors for success in involving parents at school and at home (Dauber &amp; Epstein, 1993). First, specific instruction on parent involvement issues must become a part of formal higher education, including field experience opportunities in which parents and teachers meet face-to-face in a supportive environment (Berm&#250;dez &amp; Padr&#243;n, 1988). Second, schools need to provide inservice training on parent-related issues as an ongoing activity to keep staff updated on the extensive body of research studies in the area.</paragraph><paragraph parID="5">Having activities for parents of older children is also an important consideration for schools in trying to address not only academic achievement, but children's social behavior as well. Culturally and linguistically diverse families remain alienated from the school system due to a variety of circumstances, including (a) work interference, (b) lack of confidence, (c) lack of English language skills, (d) lack of understanding of the home-school partnership, (e) lack of understanding of the school system, (f) negative past experiences with schools, and (g) insensitivity and hostility on the part of school personnel. On the other hand, teachers have cited the following barriers to effective communication with parents: (a) endorsing negative stereotypes about parents, (b) fearing and distrusting culturally diverse parents and their lifestyles, (c) not understanding the parents' home language, (d) lack of training in dealing with parents, (e) lack of time to develop parent involvement activities due to increased responsibilities, and (f) lack of institutional support. Programs that involve parents in the schools can play a major role in creating a desirable context for teaching and learning. However, there are obstacles in the way of parent participation in the schools. Many schools simply don't want parents present, and many parents are reluctant to become involved, as well. Of the 381 students enrolled in 2002-2003, there were 50% African-American students, 24% White students, 25% Latino students, and 1% Asian students; and 56% were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.</paragraph><paragraph parID="6">Although the literature on parent involvement cites many examples of challenges to parent involvement and suggestions to overcome those challenges, few models of extensive parent involvement in urban, public high schools have been described. This case study of parent involvement focused on the following question: What has made Boston Arts Academy successful in engaging a majority of parents who have varied prior school experiences and levels of engagement? Over a 2-year period, we conducted interviews with BAA parents, students, teachers, administrators, and staff. We spoke with 23 parents, representing 26 students, in individual semi-structured interviews. BAA Strategies for Achieving Their Parent Involvement Vision The goal of family involvement at BAA is to maintain open communication among the team of staff, students, and parents, which creates a "safety net" through which students cannot fall. BAA hires teachers and staff who are committed to the school's mission and the idea of parents as partners in education. A major way that the school ensures open communication among families and the school is through creative staffing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">Using its budget and staffing autonomy, the school has created two staff positions to welcome parents into the school community and keep them involved. The school community offers many different opportunities for parent involvement. As at the other Pilot high schools, family involvement activities are classified into three categories: events, membership, and communication. Parent-teacher-student (narrative) conferences Student performances Reviews of student work Workshops on the college admissions process</paragraph><paragraph parID="8">Volunteer opportunities, such as providing support at performances Parent Council Board Seeking Educational Equity and Diversity (SEED) discussion group School-to-parent liaisons Monthly newsletters This variety of opportunities allows parents with different interests, schedules, and constraints to get involved to a degree that feels appropriate to them (Ouimette, Feldman &amp; Tung, 2002). Although most parents are committed to attending school-based events that are directly related to student work, they vary greatly in the extent to which they participate in school-based events that are not directly related to student work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="9">Examples of these types of activities include serving as a room parent, participating in the Parent Council Board, and volunteering to provide support at performances and exhibitions. Two types of such involvement are (1) talking about life, education, and future goals during times they spend together and (2) providing homework support through assistance with assignments and purchasing materials and supplies. Regular communication with teachers also helps parents to stay connected to their children's education. Parents in this study describe their insecurity at meetings with other adults at Home and School Association meetings, teachers talk defensively about being verbally attacked by angry parents, and parents share discomfort entering schools due to their own level of education or past experiences in schools. For example, a mother felt extremely intimidated by other adults at her first Home and School Association meeting: Teachers and parents in my study believe that some parents have self-serving reasons for becoming involved in schools. Research participants identified formal training, support groups and administrative support necessary for successful implementation and maintenance of increased parent involvement in local school governance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="10">Support Requested by Parents and Teachers     Parents and teachers in this study indicate they are not prepared for a significant change in parent roles in decision making. Parent respondents express a need for increased communication between home and school, particularly pertaining to the children&#65533;s education in the classroom. They want their children to reach their academic potential and are willing to work with their child at home. Parent interviewees want to understand the curriculum and teacher expectations and plead for additional opportunities to discuss children&#65533;s progress; whether it be on the telephone or at parent/teacher conferences. They are frustrated with the lack of communication they receive about their child, the curriculum, and expectations at their child&#65533;s grade level. Parent respondents believe the benefits of understanding the curriculum and expectations are invaluable and would appreciate additional information. Two-way communication regarding learning styles, interests, motivation and problems children encounter is deemed essential.</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">Parents want school staffs to ask for their opinions on school matters and to listen to what they have to say. Two parents requested a schedule of preferred times to call teachers and another suggested hosting parent/teacher interviews in the evenings and more frequently. Parent/Teacher interviews provide an opportunity for teachers and parents to discuss and make decisions regarding the child&#65533;s education program or plan. She had to fight for equality for her special needs child. Creating numerous hand-outs, regular newsletters, signing agenda books, talk mail, and developing videos and sending them home are successful methods of communicating with parents, shares an experienced teacher (T:5, p.17). Parent and Teacher Roles Clearly Defined Careful formation of goals will prevent too much control going to special interest groups.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">The fine line of power between home and school in decision making should be understood by all, thus minimizing negative interactions. Another parent cited her rationale for helping with extracurricular activities, &#65533;Teachers are burning out and need to be relieved by parents&#65533; (P:5, p. 20). Respondents state that parents need to be aware of the benefits of parent involvement and how to participate in their children&#65533;s schooling in various capacities. Participants offered suggestions on how to get more parents involved: through publicity campaigns to increase awareness and by promoting the benefits of parent involvement for students, parents, schools and communities; and through personal invitation from parents and school staff. Principals are viewed as a key factor in the success or failure of school-based decision making and parent involvement. Four thousand eight hundred Parent Teacher Associations (PTA) chapter presidents had been surveyed and only 30 per cent indicated that their school offered parental involvement training for the staff (Butler, 1992). It was suggested by participants that inservice include: communication skills, collaborative decision making, confidentiality, conflict resolution, and training specific to their role.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">Many of Saskatchewan schools are rural and it appears there is difficulty attracting sufficient public interest for both boards (trustees) and councils (non-trustees).

School-Controlled Involvement     In both communities in this study, most teacher and parent participants initially seem satisfied with the existing school-controlled involvement where educators request assistance and parents oblige or parents offer and teachers direct. Two parents described their intimidating experiences with the Home and School Association.

INTRODUCTION     Increasing the parent involvement in local school governance is about re-establishing roles and developing trust relationships with new partners. Local school governance will give parents input at the local level and create a greater sense of involvement by the public. The shifting of power in education must find balance within new structures. The thesis addresses the question of how parents and teachers view increased parent involvement in local school governance and what support they require for this change. There exists much interest in recognizing the rights of parents to make educational decisions concerning their children, along with a trend that emphasizes the importance of home and school collaboration to meet the needs of children (Gareau and Sawatsky, 1995).</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">A serious concern for all jurisdictions is what to do should there be lack of interest in forming a council. Parent councils, composed of the principal, six parents, two community representatives and two teachers, run the school; approving budgets, recommending curriculum, and hiring and firing administrators. Barriers to Parent Involvement in Local School Governance     The literature describes numerous obstacles to parent involvement in local school governance. In some cases, parents actually felt that their children might be singled out or treated unfairly in grading their by teachers who deemed parents to be interfering&#65533; (Marchesani, 1993, p. 58). Teacher control creates walls between home and school and limits parent involvement. After extensive study, McCollum (1996) stated that governance reform needs several years for planning, gradual implementation, and flexible assessment mechanisms; however, clear goals for student outcomes should be documented at the beginning to help keep focus. Insider/outsider tension may be reduced with a welcoming school environment: parent bulletin boards, special coffee room, computer accessibility, resource materials, and invitations to participate in educational activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">Authentic parent involvement is based on mutual trust and respect. New teachers learn how to involve and manage from experienced teachers and administration. Principals are considered strong role models for their staffs and they must be aware of the messages they send out. School administration must creatively find time to allow teachers to meet and telephone parents. There may also be financial implications in school budgets to supplement the limited telephone access presently in schools. Both parents and teachers require time together to build trust, effective communication patterns, and mutual respect. New power structures need to be carefully outlined and communicated to all.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">This creates tension within the profession. Professionalism is not threatened with increased parent involvement in local school governance, it means adjusting to new partnerships. Educators, working independently, are professionals who now must learn to work interdependently with parents. Educators need to consider parents as assets, not as deficits in schools (Sarason, 1995). Parent interviewees desire increased information and involvement in their children&#65533;s education. They would like a synopsis of curriculum and expectations, and more frequent contact with teachers by phone or in person. Teacher respondents discussed communication tools they use to communicate with parents: student agenda books, weekly letter written by students, tests to be signed by parents, monthly letter and calender of classroom activities, and voice mail.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">On the basis of this study, it could be inferred that most parents do not wish to govern schools, they simply want more information about the educational programs their children are receiving. Educators need to determine how much time and energy they can take away from the children in the classroom to communicate with parents. One teacher described a risk-taking experience with parents who make it possible to do activities she could not do by herself in the classroom. She expresses her feelings as she had to give up a certain amount of control when having parents in for the first time to help with computers. She explains her episode,&#65533;And I suppose that expanded my horizon a little bit in that I was willing to give up some control and it was really positive&#65533; (T:1, p. 24). This teacher took great risk but the results were positive for all. Often school staffs creatively find time to meet or phone parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">Through synergy, and thinking win/win healthy relationships develop (Covey, 1989). This philosophy encourages teachers to interact with parents about the daily positive happenings in classrooms. The Parents&#65533; Role     Parents have a responsibility to keep informed, ask questions, attend workshops, and borrow resources in order to make sound decisions about their child and the school. With the right to be involved in school governance comes a responsibility to the school and children. Everyone wants to uphold the privilege but few want the consequent responsibilities. One parent stated, &#65533;I don&#65533;t want to know more and be more responsible for more&#65533; (P:2, p. 15). Governance is only a small part of what parents want for their involvement in their child&#65533;s&#65533; education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">Parents need to be as involved as they can and others must accept that. Taylor&#65533;s study (1992) found that parents were aware that their participation in school-based decision making could be misinterpreted or misused by other parents. Parents often mistrust community members who are active on councils or other formalized structures. Formalized parent organizations need to work at reducing tension with those in informal roles in schools. Several parent interviewees felt that support groups should be developed to share parenting and schooling successes and difficulties with children. It should be the parents&#65533; responsibility to establish and maintain these groups. Two teacher respondents spoke highly of the volunteer coordinator, who matched parents&#65533; talents with needs in the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">Parent organizations are encouraged to maintain this volunteer position. Formal Training for Parents and Teacher     Teacher respondents identified a need for formal training where parents and teachers can dialogue, define roles, establish a Code of Ethics or standards of behavior, and discuss other relevant issues at school. Inexperienced teachers would appreciate an experienced mentor to guide them through parent involvement dynamics. Other respondents spoke of support groups where they could share successes and receive feedback for perceived failures. A component of a university class dealing with community relations, parent involvement, working with parents and school councils should be designed and implemented. The university needs to prepare Education students to work with parents in decision making in classrooms. New teachers need to boost their confidence in communicating and working with parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">Recommendations for Future Study     There will be an ongoing need to assess the progress of parent involvement in local school governance, to access the effectiveness of the training of parents, teachers and administrators, and the commitment of the community. I have compiled recommendations for future investigation in this area of study. Although my intent was not to focus on administration, both teachers and parents stressed the importance of administrative support for parent involvement to be successful. Due to the significant influence of school administrators on parent involvement, the training they receive must be carefully designed. A study about administrators and their thoughts on parent involvement in local school governance will help design effective training workshops. Parent involvement in local school governance in schools differs from rural, urban, and community-designated schools. It would be of interest to investigate how diverse backgrounds affect the quality of school councils.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">Experience suggests that the most vocal and best-organized school councils will be found in the middle- and upper-income schools and neighborhoods, where the parents have the time to take an active part in school affairs and the resources to supplement school budgets&#65533; (Dunning, 1995, p. 19). What is the reality within the diversity of Saskatchewan? I recommend a study of successful councils to learn how they define their roles, determine their goals, and decision-making processes, and what real authority they possess. This would provide a model for other schools who are in the process of implementing increased parent involvement in local school governance. After several years of increased involvement in local school governance, it would be worthwhile to study its effects in regard to public accountability, student achievement, and community satisfaction. After increased parent involvement in local school governance, it would be worthwhile to study its effects in regard to public accountability, student achievement, and community satisfaction several years from now. One might expect future SSTA survey results to indicate contentment with education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">The benefits in schools, in communities, and in society should be documented to further justify parent involvement in decision making. A study investigating why significant numbers of men choose not to be involved in schools would help design strategies to include them in their children&#65533;s education. My final observation is that all of the parent interviewees suggested by administrators were women. Fathers too have talents and skills to share in schools and local school governance. Research participants describe current parent involvement in education, tensionality along the journey to increase parent involvement in local school governance and support required for parent involvement in local school governance. The research findings suggest that few parents presently desire involvement in local school governance. Most prefer to interact at the classroom level with their children and teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">With increased parent involvement in local school governance, schools may become more responsive to the needs of children. Tensionalities between home and school will be addressed through the building of trusting relationships. New relationships develop through meaningful two way communication between home and school, clearly defined parent and teacher roles, and support. Back to Contents Alberta Department of Education.

Like Wrights' case study school in Gympie, Omi Chugakko has, However the first problem that must be addressed is how to get the community to realise the needs of the school, to involve themselves in problem solving, and then to 'own' their decisions as a community. In the west many teachers and administrators may claim that their hands are bound because the system, "...so protects the individual student that it sacrifices the good of the student body". As put by Murnane and Levy in a recent article, "...the greater part of any solution involves the dull and gritty work of improving the quality of instruction...on a daily basis" If the school was able to lighten the teachers workload there would be more benefit to the students academically. Teachers could focus more on the individual academic needs and well being of each student. Awareness and responsibility would also be increased as the community shared with the school a new role as co-educators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">These should be undertaken regularly in an effort to make the community proud of 'their school'. In a final sense schools are for the benefit of students, but this in turn ultimately benefits and builds community. "This program created a lot of questions, doubts, and fear," McReynolds says. "The concerns came from some parents and some fellow teachers. We [she and her students' parents] had a lot of support from the administration and from some teachers, but more than once we were told that it wouldn't work. Our motto became 'We know you believe it can't be done, but all we ask is that you move aside while we do it!'" "The main concern," she explains, "was giving the parents equal control as active partners in the process."</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">"We proved that parents have and can continue to have a huge impact in our school and our district," adds McReynolds. "We have to be able work with our parents and to help them help their children. And we have to learn to reduce the fear on both sides and work together. Schools have to be willing to unlock the doors and encourage parents to become involved, to set goals, to become active partners." "We've just begun to tap the most important resource we have," McReynolds concludes. "Our parents will be able to help us accomplish the highest standards possible for our children." Article by Gary Hopkings Education World&#174; Editor-in-Chief Copyright &#169; 2004 Education World</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">"Eight basic and essential facts" comprise the core of the program: Family involvement is a critical part of high quality education, a safe and disciplined learning environment, and student achievement. What the family does is more important that what the family income or education level is. All parents want the best education for their children. Most parents want to be more involved in their child's education, but many don't know how to become involved. Most teachers feel that parent involvement is a vital part of student achievement, but many of them do not know how to get the parents involved. Schools need to encourage and promote parent involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">School practices that encourage parents to participate are the most important factor in whether or not parents will participate. Schools need to encourage parents to become partners and thus be able to make decisions about their children's education. "Parent involvement will probably make more difference than anything else we could ever do to help our children learn," says Bonnie McReynolds, the teacher behind the program. While most teachers work hard to develop and maintain solid programs in which kids come first, they're at a loss when it comes to figuring out where to begin when it comes to getting parents involved. In 1994, Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley announced the formation of a nationwide partnership to "promote partnerships that will increase parental involvement and participation." A 1992 study (Barton and Corey) showed that controllable factors -- such as absenteeism and tardiness, the amount of TV watched, and the kinds of learning activities that are offered at home -- make a huge difference in the average student's achievements. Reading achievement is more dependent on learning activities in the home than is math or science achievement (The College Board, 1994) and the single most important activity for building knowledge required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children (Anderson et al., 1985).</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">Dozens of studies point to one important conclusion: What the family does is more important than family background (income, parental education, marital status, family size, etc.). Encouraging parents to participate in their children's education is more important than family background in determining whether or not parents get involved. The goals are stated at the start of the school year in a contract between parents, teachers, and students. That contract lists everyone's responsibilities and is signed by each of the participants. "The goal of the contract is a very simple one: Helping children to learn," says McReynolds. "Parents support their children in many ways," McReynolds says. "They provide shelter, food, clothing, protection, and love.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">They also need to support the work that goes on in the classroom." Providing time and a place for doing homework, reading with a child, making sure homework is understood and finished, talking about what is being done at school, and continuing to learn how to help are just a few of the ways in which parents "teach." In addition, parents can get actively involved in the classroom as volunteer tutors, as lecturers sharing their own expertise, and in many other ways. "Kids got to see their parents in action and, more importantly, they got to see themselves as contributors to the larger community." "That means getting actively involved in finding out what is being taught, how it is taught, and how children learn and develop." Parents can take classes (offered through adult education programs, community colleges, etc.) on their own to demonstrate to their children how important learning is. Or they can take classes with their children; computer classes or hobby classes are two possibilities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">An open-door policy allows parents to come into the classroom at any time. "Parents must be involved as teachers, learners, supporters, and advocates for their children." Kids who know that their parents are involved and interested tend to take more responsibility for their own learning and behavior. Spent more time at home involved with their child's educational needs; Spent more time involved with their child at school; Had a better understanding of how they might help their child; In addition, this fall McReynolds and others involved in the program (including two parents, the school board president, and the school superintendent) will travel to San Francisco to present a session about the program and the importance of parental involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">The conference "showcases current and promising new approaches tobuilding partnershipsthat will carry public education successfully into the 21st century." Its students perform well on a variety of indicators of student engagement and achievement, and parent attendance at school-based events over the past few years has been consistently high. Parents who attended more than the two required events and/or were members of the school's Parent Council were included in the "high" category and those who attended the two required events or fewer were included in the "medium" category. BAA's Strategies Result in Parents' Feeling Well-Informed and Welcomed Parents in general wanted to be involved as much as possible at the school in order to know what was going on with their children. Involving parents in the care and schooling of their children helps parents, teachers and the children themselves. Most importantly, children have better academic and social outcomes when their parents and teachers work well together. Research tells us that:</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">If their children have an emotional or behavioural problem, parents frequently turn to teachers for help. Parents who get involved are more likely to understand and support any particular approaches that are being used with a child, and will support these strategies at home. Parents who get involved take a greater role in their child's education and activities around schooling, which leads children do better academically and socially. School partnerships are about focusing on the child - they are about considering the needs of both the school and the family in creating the best environment for the child. They aren't about schools taking responsibility from parents. Children perform better at school when their parents are involved in their education. Children settle better into school programs when their parents are involved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">Children feel valued and important when their parents take an interest in their lives. Children observe and learn positive interactions through watching others interact. Staff experience a higher level of job satisfaction in an environment that encourages listening, respect and appreciation. Staff stress levels are reduced when staff and parents work in partnership. Staff can develop important social skills when they communicate with parents. For parents Involvement gives parents the opportunity to discuss their child's interests with staff, and to have some input into the program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="39">Parents who are familiar with a program feel more comfortable about raising concerns and negotiating solutions with staff. Positive partnerships with staff can relieve parent stress. Keeping in contact For child care and school professionals working with parents, sharing information is a great way to set up a partnership. Interaction between teachers and parents can help with the child's development and wellbeing. The way this interaction happens has a major impact on how parents relate to you personally and to your organisation. A good initial message to the parent is that teachers know their child as an individual and are interested in them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="40">When talking with the parent, tell them about what your school does and why. Talk about your approach and what you hope to do for their child. It's a good idea to begin by asking the parent some basic questions, for example: What are they hoping to get from the school? What are the child's interests, strengths, likes and dislikes? How would they like to be kept informed about their child and day-to-day happenings at school? What kind of information might they like to support them as a parent?</paragraph><paragraph parID="41">In what ways do they think they might like to be involved? Before school begins Welcome all parents and incoming students by sending a welcome greeting. Learn about the students and their families. Establish positive communication with all families, and give some information about you as a teacher. Let parents know about your philosophy and teaching practices. Set out classroom policies and inform parents when and how it's best to reach you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">Invite parents to a beginning school meeting. Send home 'good news' messages about all students' behaviour and progress. Call parents to tell them something positive their child has done. Perhaps choose one parent per day and make contact either by phone or letter. Send home a weekly newsletter informing parents about classroom activities and any upcoming events. Make sure newsletters are translated for any parents who speak English as a second language. Set up regular informal meetings for parents and teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="43">Perhaps once or twice a month parents could come along with a packed lunch and join the teacher for an informal question and answer session. Go on home visits. These are an opportunity to meet the family in their familiar surroundings, and gives the child the chance to see their parent and teacher working together. Schools can increase the involvement of parents in schools in a variety of ways, including things like participation on committees, attendance at special days and events, taking part in programs, and helping out with events such as excursions and fetes.

If parents are really involved in their child's school life, you can expect: parents and professionals to bring tensions, issues and concerns out in the open professionals to find ways of connecting with parents and letting them in on their child's day better understanding on the part of teachers of family situations. Whilst there is no evidence that these kinds of programmes have a direct impact on pupil achievement, they may help parents feel more comfortable about approaching school and more willing to play a part in their children's education. How might we use research about parental involvement to inform attempts to close the social class achievement gap?</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">The studies in the review consistently showed that parental involvement has a large and positive effect on children's achievement and engagement. Consequently, the reviewers argued, if the involvement of lower SES parents in their children' s learning at home could be enhanced, very significant advances in school achievement might reasonably be expected. The reviewers concluded that schools could enhance parental involvement, but they recognised that the challenge is multidimensional. The studies showed there are many different barriers to parental involvement. Therefore an initiative to enhance parental involvement would need to tackle the problems faced by some parents, including: the effects of extreme poverty the effects of substance abuse and domestic violence</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">the effects of depression lack of confidence in, or knowledge about, how to support their child's learning the impact of inappropriate values and beliefs the impact of the difficult child. Some parents will need help with all these issues, whilst others will need selective support. The reviewers commented on how so far, initiatives have attempted to deal with each of these challenges separately -  that there seems to have been no initiative that has attempted to manage all the issues simultaneously and they suggested the way forward might be an approach which includes strategies to deal with all the identified issues. This may be a less daunting prospect than it might have been until very recently, when the introduction of the Every Child Matters agenda  created an environment in which schools are expected to collaborate with other professionals involved in children's development, such as social workers and health professionals.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">The authors of this interpretative review searched databases (such as Education-Line and the British Education Index) and websites (including the DfES, LEA websites and the Electronic Journals service) using seven key terms, for relevant studies published between 1990 and 2003. They also collected material recommended by experts in the field from the UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand and Scandinavia. The reviewers identified two types of research: The reviewers outlined some of the strengths and weaknesses of the studies they reported upon, but did not indicate what criteria they used for including or excluding studies (as systematic reviews do). Naturally occurring parental involvement The reviewers considered that recent research on naturally occurring parental involvement was sound because the studies: involved large samples of parents, children and schools made objective measures of involvement and impact</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">used statistical techniques to test assumptions about the relationship of causes and effects between the process of involvement and their educational impact. The studies were consistent about the processes involved and the scale of the impact. Intervention programmes evaluations were often subjective, after the event and usually did not refer to comparison groups. Because this was an interpretative review and because the reviewers themselves noted technical weaknesses in the intervention programme data, it was not possible for them to draw conclusions about the causes and effects of the intervention programmes, although they argued that this did not necessarily indicate that they were ineffective. What are the implications of this study? This review investigated how parents influence children's achievement at school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">It found that the single most important factor is their involvement at home and specifically, the conversations they have with their children. Teachers may like to consider the following implications: Could you do more to promote conversations between children and their parents at home, through, for example, asking children to collect artefacts or take photos at home to bring into school or setting interactive homework activities specifically designed to involve parents? (Case studies 2 and 5 could provide useful starting points). Could you do more to build on the conversations that take place at home between parents and their children? Would it be helpful to share ideas with your colleagues for ways of doing this? (Case study 1, which highlights the difference between adult-child conversations at home and school, could provide a useful starting point).</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">Could you do more to monitor whether the strategies you use to increase parental involvement at home contribute to increased pupil learning, and share with parents evidence of the impact of their efforts? Could you do more to raise your colleagues' awareness of the importance of parental involvement at home throughout their children's schooling and give them the opportunity to share ideas about ways they might promote conversations between parents and their children? The review highlighted how some parents don't see it as their role to get involved, whilst others don't know how to support their child's learning at home. Could your school provide opportunities, such as workshops and discussion groups for parents and carers to see how children learn particular subjects at school, to help them see ways they can help their children at home and the importance of doing so? (the third case study could provide a useful starting point). The reviewers recognised that the challenge of enhancing parental involvement in vulnerable children's learning is likely to be multidimensional. Could you do more to engage with other agencies, such as the educational welfare service, children's social services, youth offending teams and voluntary organisations, such as Childline, Kidscape and NSPCC, or become more actively involved in initiatives in your area designed to tackle the severe problems faced by some families?</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">Filling in the gaps    Gaps that are uncovered in a piece of research have a useful role in making sure that future research builds cumulatively on what is known.

For younger children, 'at home' parenting provides the child with a context to gain school-related skills (such as reading and counting) along with opportunities to develop qualities of motivation and self-worth. Level of education Kohl et al found the more educated the parent, the greater their involvement in their child's education. Having a more limited educational experience meant that some parents lacked the relevant skills to get involved. Practitioners may like to read a case study of a school that set out to enhance parents' knowledge of how they could support their children with mathematics homework to give them the confidence to play a greater part in their child's education. Parents' view of their role Williams et al found that 2% of parents felt the responsibility for education belonged wholly to the school, whilst 58% believed they had at least equal responsibility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">The remaining 40% were presumably somewhere in between. How do pupils affect the level of their parents' involvement? A study of 872 Canadian students aged 14-15 years (Deslandes and Cloutier) for example, found that students were generally positive about asking their parents to help them with their schoolwork: 60% would ask their parents to listen to them read something they had written 86% would invite parents to assist with ideas for a project 66% would work with parents to improve their grades. Another study (Edwards and Alldred) of 70 children aged 10 and 14 years, showed how although some children promote parent involvement, others   discourage it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">Children who actively promoted parental involvement might, for example, spontaneously tell their parents about the school day or ask for help with schoolwork. Their motives seemed to be to do with wanting their parents' company rather than wanting to advance their achievement. Children who were passive about promoting parental involvement 'went along' with parental activity - for example, they 'did not mind' parents offering to help and they responded when asked about the school day. Children who discouraged, evaded or obstructed parental involvement often did so because they felt their parents were 'too busy' or 'not the type'. They might block home-school connections by, for example, dumping school notes or newsletters or censuring discussions of 'bad days at school'. Sometimes pupils felt they did not need parental involvement because, for example, they saw it as their own responsibility to do their homework. Practitioners may like to read a case study that shows how setting 'interactive' homework (tasks that had a clear role for parents) increased the amount of time parents spent supporting their child's learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">The reviewers reported on family and community education programmes specifically designed to provide guidance and help for such families. Parent Involvement Positive parent involvement is essential to student achievement Research shows that when families are involved in a child's education, test scores are higher, attendance is better and students have a more positive attitude. Every school has a Parent Involvement Plan that relates to a school meeting its academic goals. Many schools have goals that reach beyond classroom volunteerism, such as providing parent training on specialized school computer programs and involving a higher percentage of parents in reading incentive programs.

Working together When schools work together with families to support children's learning, children tend to succeed in both school and later life. Many people are surprised that the most accurate predictor of a student's achievement is not income or social status; it is how involved the student's parents are in their children's education. Studies show that students have higher grades and test scores, better attendance, more positive attitudes and behavior, higher graduation rates, and greater enrollment in post secondary education when schools work collaboratively with families. Schools aren't the only ones to reap the benefits of parental involvement. Parents gain a first-hand understanding of their child's daily activities by spending time at school and interacting with staff.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">Students need you to take an interest in their education by asking about school and demonstrating that you value learning. Keep this in mind when notices about first quarter parent/teacher conferences come home. Parents gain insight into the trends and fads of school life that will help them communicate with their child as they grow and change. We hope you will all take the time to attend these important conferences. The district is committed to student achievement for all students, and recognizes the important connection between parent involvement and student learning. Parents are children's first and most important teachers. I look forward to working together with you to provide all of our students with the best educational experience possible.</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">Sincerely, Carol Comeau, Superintendent Ready to Read, Ready to Learn In September 2006 a task force evaluated how we as Alaskans prepare young children to read and learn and why it is important to society. The plan outlines opportunities for families to get engaged in their child's education. If children don't know how or when to use information, it will soon be forgotten.

But Knight said that even with two sets of books, her daughter is still "overwhelmed" with material to carry. "I'd just like to see them come up with a better system and relieve kids of books," she said. The Center on Families, Communities, Schools, and Children's Learning (1994) indicates that parents who receive frequent and positive messages from teachers tend to become more involved in their children's education than do other parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">In their national study of 2,317 inner-city elementary and middle school students, the best predictor of parent involvement was what the school did to promote it. Don Davies, former U.S. Commissioner of Education and former president of the Institute for Responsive Education, states, "In any school...leadership is essential if a school staff is to choose the partnership approach to school reform.... In most cases, the leadership to reach out to the community will have to come from the principal" (Davies, 1991, p. 382). Teacher-parent partnerships foster mutual support for teacher and parent roles, increase parent involvement in various school activities and improvement projects, and lead to positive growth for students (Swick, 1991). To promote such partnerships, the Family Involvement Partnership for Learning suggests that members of the school community develop a family-school compact for learning . Accommodate parents' work schedules when creating parent-involvement opportunities. Assign homework projects that engage each child's parents and family and make learning more meaningful for the student, such as a family history, interviews with grandparents, or descriptions of parents' daily work. Sometimes parents are frustrated because schools do not seem to know much about their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">Educators and parents should aim to increase the percentage of parents involved in at least some ways. Every school has at least some parents who are deeply involved; the key is to steadily increase this number. DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW: Although most educators and parents say they support parent involvement in schools, many parents appear to support a wider range of involvement opportunities than do educators. A recent Gallup poll (Elam, 1990) asked parents if they were satisfied with the amount of participation they had in their school. Fifty-nine percent said they wanted a greater voice in the way school funds were allocated, 53 percent said they wanted more say in what courses were offered, and 46 percent said they wanted more say in hiring administrators (versus 37 percent who said they had the right amount of say in hiring administrators). Some universities appear to believe that training teachers and administrators how to work with parents is not especially important. Certainly, parents should take an active interest in what the child is doing (or not doing) in the classroom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">Parents are expected to be strong advocates for their children. I can understand that parents don't want their kids to hurt---physically or emotionally. I suppose the Goldilocks style of parenting means that you do these things in a realistic way: keep in contact with the others who are involved in your child's life without coming from the stance that your child can do no wrong nor have Life do wrong to them. And I don't want to suggest that this coach doesn't deserve a wonderful thank you dinner for his part in developing the athleticism of this student (or that the student shouldn't have a chance at college). From a high mark of 12 million in the 1960s, national PTA membership has dropped to a little more than 5 million. In an era of email, Facebook fan pages and Twitter accounts for schools, blog-savvy parents with an axe to grind, and any other number of options, is a brick and mortar organization (like the PTA) still relevant? Schools are still places where people meet and learn---virtual support isn't going to be enough when it comes to doing the best we can for all kids (not just the ones whose parents have a special interest wheel to squeak).</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">These were the parents who advocated for their children beyond what might be considered normal...almost to the point of embarrassing both themselves and their children. We've more or less been at this eyerolling state of things ever since. It means that while high expectations and positive thinking are wonderful things, it is more important that the child have an internal representation of those...not just external ones. The provocatively titled article " Do Parents Matter? " The snippet available in my Reader feed suggested that when it comes to child behaviour, peers (and teachers) have a larger impact than parents. No doubt there's a difference in cultures, but maybe we could study how they do it and apply their methods here. However, I'm left wondering about those classes I had where it really was one bad apple spoiling the rest---how incredible it was that the presence or absence of one student could have so much impact on the tenor of the class as a whole.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">This may be why teachers and peers can have such an enormous influence. And this week, it was an article in Newsweek (US) and the London Times (UK) that had the nice jive. In fact, one study found that "no group of parents-married, single, step or even empty nest-reported significantly greater emotional well-being than people who never had children. It's understandable, and yet, if you accommodate the eldest child, can you ever defend drawing a line and not following the same course of action for the younger ones? "I can't express enough the difficulties that taking my children to two high schools will cause." "I have no problem academically with her being at Lafayette," Allen said of her daughter Julia, "but it's just - for this one year while I have one still at Jamestown - the challenges I have of parenting them both, the extracurriculars, being involved in two PTAs. At least one elementary school in my district has a policy that kids can bring the "stuff" for their projects, but work must be done at school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">Mom's biggest rant however, is firmly in her own backyard to solve. However, most teachers provide extended timelines for these assignments. It's such a vital piece of the educational jigsaw and yet they are not visibly involved with discussions about the kinds of things impacting students: NCLB, state requirements, School Improvement Plans, and so on. Do you try for awhile to help correct behaviors...or do you just give up around second grade? I don't think that many parents out there realize this and that it is the reason that they neglect to support their children's learning to the fullest. I realize that the feds think we can get all kids to standard without parents helping along the way, but I don't know an educator out there who thinks that's realistic. My additional duties over the summer include managing a summer program for our sophs who didn't meet the standards on the state tests in April...and making sure the retakes in August run smoothly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">This would relieve some pressure on the kid and yet allow him to stay in the class. Why should my kid have to write out answers on the test? Not to mention the number of families who didn't read their letters properly, seem to have been living in a bubble over the last 5+ years and claim to never heard of graduation requirements, or are under a delusion that their kid is going to make up several grade levels in reading during a 16-session prep course. Part of the reason for it is that we actually get money from the state for all of this "academic counseling" I'm doing. I have a situation in my AP class that is completely new to me: a kid wants to stay in the class...and his parents want him to drop. I'm used to the other situation---where a kid wants to get out of a class and his/her parents think they should keep at it. I don't know quite what to do this time, because the student is in a very awkward position: to stay in the class means defying his parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">I talked with his mother. "Parents polled said their children spend an average of 90 minutes a night on homework. The workload grows as the students do - 78 minutes of homework a night in elementary school, 99 minutes in middle school and 105 in high school." Is homework something that is completed alone by the student or might it involve a study group or some parental help? Others have been focused on the quality of the assignments. I went to represent the school district (along with a few others) at an event for parents last night. The event was specifically targeting parents of minority children---giving them an opportunity to find out how to connect with the schools and get more involved with their childrens' education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">I had been warned that when events like this had been planned, that parents were scarce. There was some good coversation with others in my district about what "good" parent involvement looks like. Last night, the Boss Lady mentioned that to her, good parent involvement means getting your kids off to school in the morning---cleaned, dressed, and fed---and checking in with them about assignments and school events in the evenings. Maybe it's not about having parents come to the school to volunteer. Maybe it's not about Open House or other events that try to lure parents to the buildings. This consists of a general assembly for parents followed by a period-by-period meeting with each teacher. Here are my best tips (not that you asked) for a successful meeting with a group of parents in your classroom:</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">Talk about what homework "looks like" for your class. Many parents have the impression that homework means there is a worksheet. Also share how often homework may be assigned and some estimates about the completion time. Give parents some suggestions about how to talk to their kid about your class in order to keep the communication lines open. What should they ask about? Are there topics upon which students could elaborate? Give parents some gentle questions to use in order to gauge kids in conversation and reflection about their learning so that it doesn't have to look like the "third degree."</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">Provide a handout with your contact information---including the best times to reach you and your preferred means of communication (phone? Share ideas for parental involvement. Are there events where you need chaperones? Can they spare a box of Kleenex? Would you mind if they sat in on a class or lab? I'm hoping for another successful introduction to parents this year. Some parents have been complaining to college administrators about the issues such as student grades, roommates, and even plumbing issues while overseas.</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">This year, they got a statement about Colgate's philosophy of self-reliance - a message that was hammered home repeatedly in talks by administrators. All students take both a full course of arts and college preparatory academics. This case study emerged from an earlier study of parent involvement practices across the Boston Pilot Schools Network (Ouimette, Feldman &#185; &amp;amp; Tung, 2002). Boston Arts Academy was chosen as a case study school because it enrolls a diverse population. In order to present a range of involvement levels, parents were randomly selected from groups according to the number and type of events that they attended. The Vision of Parent Involvement at BAA Parents have been an integral part of the BAA community since the school opened in 1998. With this vision in mind, they designed a school that offers parents many ways to support their children's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">For example, they knew that some parents may not have been welcomed or accustomed to participating in their children's school, while others may have always felt empowered to voice their opinions and participate in every aspect of the school. The Community Outreach Coordinator ensures that Boston students and their parents know that the school is an option for them, while the Family Coordinator keeps BAA parents well informed and encourages engagement in the school community. From interviews with parents, we find that both high- and medium-involvement parents participate to a high degree in any events or activities directly related to their own children's school work, such as parent-teacher-student narratives, performances, and exhibitions. Parents are comfortable going into the school and they feel known; for example, teachers and administrators know parents by name and greet them when they are at the school, which many parents said was not always the case at other schools. Overall, parents in both groups were happy with the school and satisfied that it was doing a good job. Boston Arts Academy engages a vast majority of its parents in school-based activities through multiple events and entry points, a welcoming school environment, and frequent communication among staff and parents. Although BAA's Pilot status provides unique advantages for implementing a parent engagement strategy, other schools may learn from the model, even if they do not have autonomy or are not small.</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">Creating multiple, diverse opportunities for parent involvement, and support for parents to avail themselves of these opportunities Summarized from a paper presented at the 2004 annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association, San Diego, CA.

Despite the validity of some studies, much parent involvement research to date contains serious methodological flaws.</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">But it is possible that more effective parent involvement will generate cost savings by lessening the need for remedial and other special programs. National Council of Jewish Women Center for the Child Amy J. L. Baker and Laura M. Soden Recent major legislation, such as the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), has made parents' involvement in their children's education a national priority. School districts nationwide are being encouraged to reexamine their parent involvement policies and programs and to demonstrate innovative approaches in order to obtain Federal education dollars. In particular, eligibility for Title I funding, available to school districts in high poverty areas, is now contingent upon the development of "compacts" in which families and schools agree to assume mutual responsibility for children's learning: partnerships must be forged between homes, schools, and communities, requiring an unprecedented level of contact and communication between parents and educators (e.g., U.S. Department of Education, 1994). While most practitioners and researchers support the policy direction of increased parent involvement, few agree about what constitutes effective involvement. Confusion persists regarding the activities, goals, and desired outcomes of various parent involvement programs and policies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">A major source of this confusion is the lack of scientific rigor in the research informing practice and policy. Because of this, less is known about parent involvement than commonly is assumed. Nonetheless, early studies suggesting the importance of parent involvement are treated as definitive, regardless of the equivocal nature of the data, and they are used to support the position that all types of parent involvement are important. Moreover, many programs and policies promoting parent involvement are not explicitly based on the evidence that does exist. Reliance on such compromised data may lead to unrealistic expectations of what parent involvement programs and practices actually are able to accomplish. Fortunately, the current national policy agenda has created a window of opportunity for improving programs and practice through high quality research. Thus, this digest, which is based on a critical evaluation of over 200 research studies, briefly reviews findings from parent involvement research to date, discusses their validity and utility, and proposes critical questions for future researchers in the field to consider.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">Research Findings to Date Years of practice wisdom, theory, and related areas of research (i.e., the importance of the home literacy environment, parental stimulation of children's language development, security of the parent-child attachment relationship, and parent involvement in preschool and early intervention programs) strongly suggest that parents' involvement in their children's formal schooling is vital for their academic success, even though the research evidence is less than conclusive. While methodological limitations are prevalent in the majority of parent involvement research (described below), the sound studies that do exist have consistently found strong parent involvement effects. For example, Tizard, Schofield, and Hewison (1982) demonstrated the clear positive impact of parents' listening to their children read at home; Fantuzzo, Davis, and Ginsburg (1995) demonstrated that an intervention program that included a parent involvement component was clearly superior to another without one; and Rodick and Henggeler (1980) found that a parent involvement intervention was more advantageous for children than an in-school intervention. Moreover, the cumulative knowledge from existing studies suggests the importance of several other specific types of parent involvement, including the following: provision of a stimulating literacy and material environment (Snow et al., 1991), high expectations and moderate levels of parental suport and supervision (Kurdek, Fine, &amp; Sinclair, 1995), appropriate monitoring of television viewing and homework completion (Clark, 1993), participation in joint learning activities at home (Tizard et al., 1982), an emphasis on effort over ability (Stevenson, 1983), and autonomy promoting parenting practices (Lamborn, Mounts, Steinberg, &amp; Dornbusch, 1991). There is mounting evidence that each of these parent involvement variables facilitates children's academic achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">There are also indications that they do so in relatively complex ways that interact with family background and social context variables such as ethnicity, family structure, maternal employment status, socioeconomic status, and gender (Schiamberg &amp; Chin, 1986; Milne, 1989; Tocci &amp; Englehard, 1991; Zimilies &amp; Lee, 1991; Lee &amp; Croninger, 1994). Continuing to determine the ways that various types of parent involvement positively affect student achievement in different contexts should be a major research priority in the field. Further, to have greater confidence in the findings of such studies, higher quality research must be conducted. Methodological Limitations in Existing Research Despite the validity of some studies, much parent involvement research to date contains serious methodological flaws, which results in a lack of confidence in their findings and limits their accuracy and usefulness. In general, flaws in existing research fall into four areas: use of non experimental design, lack of isolation of parent involvement effects, inconsistent definitions of parent involvement, and non-objective measures of parent involvement. Use of Non-Experimental Design Many of the field studies examining the impact of parent involvement on children's achievement employ non-experimental designs which are too weak to allow for confidence in their findings. These designs-as compared to true experiments-do not contain the controls necessary for researchers to conclude that parent involvement is the cause of enhanced student performance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">Thus, alternative explanations, other than parent involvement, cannot be ruled out. For example, one common alternative explanation rarely ruled out in such non-experimental designs is that the children in the parent involvement program were better students to begin with than were those not in the program. In such cases, these children would have performed better academically regardless of the parent involvement intervention. Only with a true experiment can it be ascertained with certainty that improved student achievement is due to parent involvement. Lack of Isolation of Parent Involvement Effects Separation of the effects of parent involvement from that of the involvement of other adults. For example, in many studies, children in a parent involvement intervention were compared with children not receiving the intervention, and improvements in achievement were identified as benefits of parent involvement. Drawing such a conclusion is based on the consensus in the field that parent involvement programs have their impact not only through specific learning activities, but through changes in a network of interrelated family factors (i.e., home environment, parental expectations for their children's performance, increased cognitive stimulation) (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">The studies did not rule out an alternative explanation: that children's performance would improve after they received extra assistance from any adult. Separation of the effects of parent involvement from that of other intervention components. Researchers sometimes concluded that parent involvement was the critical factor in the success of an intervention program that offered a variety of concurrent activities, such as an educational curriculum for children or social services for the family. However, they failed to test the specific effects of parent involvement in analyses independent of the effects of other aspects of the program. Conclusions regarding the specific impact of parent involvement are not justified in such studies. In fact, some studies have been able to isolate the specific effects of parent involvement. This suggests that certain research designs where a single parent involvement component is measured and related to a single child achievement outcome offer a feasible approach for examining the relationship among these individual variables.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">Similarly, when an intervention is comprised of a single component (e.g., parental participation in a workshop), assessing its effects allows for the isolation of the impact of parent involvement. However, in situations where a package of services is provided, as is the case with many comprehensive programs, participation in each program component must be measured separately in order to isolate and assess the specific effects of parental involvement. Inconsistent Definitions of Parent Involvement While many studies have measured the construct of parent involvement, few have operationalized it the same way. Some researchers have focused on attitudinal components of parent involvement by defining it as parental aspirations or expectations for the child's educational success. Other researchers have focused on behavioral aspects of parent involvement, such as assistance with homework or attendance at parent-teacher conferences. In other cases parent involvement was conceptualized as parenting style or family interaction patterns. Such differences in definitions and measurement of parent involvement make it difficult to assess cumulative knowledge across different studies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">Even when focusing on the same aspect of parent involvement, researchers operationalized it inconsistently. For example, while several studies have examined the impact of the quality of the home environment on children's academic achievement, rarely did two studies define home environment in the same way. In one, the home environment was measured as maternal involvement and responsiveness, avoidance of restriction, organized environment, play facilitation, and daily variety. Alternatively, another study defined the home environment as the number of parents in the home, the home library, reading at home, watching television, working on homework, absence from school, parent involvement, and family resources. While there is clearly a conceptual overlap between these two operationalizations of the home environment, they are nevertheless quite distinct: the former emphasizes the processes within the parent-child affective relationship that may impact student achievement while the latter emphasizes the family material and psychological resources allocated to children. Equally problematic is the measurement of only a specific aspect of parent involvement (attitudes, behaviors, etc.) while discussing results in terms of the broader construct without acknowledging that only a portion of it was actually measured. When such generalizations are made about the effectiveness of parent involvement from data about a circumscribed aspect, conclusions may lead to unrealistic expectations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Non-Objective Measures of Parent Involvement Researchers frequently assessed parent involvement by the parent's (or some other informant's) report rather than by observation or objective measure. Thus, more is known about what parent say they do than about what they actually do. The bias in using subjective reports in parent involvement research should be a serious concern. Because parents, students, and teachers have a vested interest in reporting parents' behavior in a certain light, there may be distortions in the data collected. Lack of objective data becomes especially problematic when information about parent involvement and child achievement outcomes is reported by the same person; the result can be a distortion of the statistical relationships obtained, producing stronger correlations between the two than would otherwise be the case. Some researchers have attempted to increase the validity of self-report data by measuring parent involvement from more than one source (parent, teachers, students). However, this approach has resulted in low correspondence among the different respondents, indicating that one or both reports may have been inaccurate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">Self report measures of parent involvement have another drawback in that they tend to be closed-ended surveys that cannot fully capture the dynamic nature of parents' involvement in their children's education. When parents visit schools, meet with teachers, read to their school-aged children, and assist their children with homework, complex interactions are at work. Many of these processes could better be explored through open-ended and observational techniques, which would produce rich data, shed light on multi-faceted interactions and relationships over time, and generate new hypotheses about the role of parent involvement. Inaccuracy of Program Evaluations Program evaluations may be the most challenging form of applied educational field research that exists. Unfortunately, they tend to be among the weaker parent involvement studies, plagued by many of the flaws described above. In addition to the general constraints of conducting research in an applied setting, program evaluations pose special obstacles for researchers because of the clinical and ethical issues involved in withholding treatment or wait-listing participants who clearly might benefit from the program (i.e., at-risk students, low-income families). Moreover, program evaluations often are funded from the larger program implementation budget, creating tensions between research and program needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">Therefore, most are conducted out of necessity, with a limited budget, and within the constraints of a service provider setting where the rigors of science often come second to the needs of the program being implemented. Recommendations for Future Research Future parent involvement studies must overcome the methodological limitations identified above in order to increase their accuracy and utility. Specifically, greater attention needs to be paid to several key issues in parent involvement research, related to both theory and methodology, in order for studies to identify with greater precision the types of involvement that have positive outcomes for students' achievement. While increasing the rigor of parent involvement research in educational settings, researchers will also have to be more sensitive to the needs of parents and staff who may consider implementation of some of the more rigorous evaluation procedures intrusive and judgmental. Including parents in the development of measures and protocols may ease their concerns and also provide a mechanism for obtaining valuable input. In addition, funding allocations to program evaluations and applied educational research in general will need to increase. The resulting data will be more useful, justifying the cost, and it is possible that more effective parent involvement will generate cost savings by lessening the need for remedial and other special programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">In addition, researchers designing parent involvement studies need to take care that their presumptions are well-defined, their questions are clear, and their findings are unambiguous. To accomplish these goals, studies should embody the following characteristics: Use of Experimental Procedures Only one study design, the true experiment, adequately overcomes all the threats to internal validity problematic in educational research. The critical component of this design, random assignment to the control and experimental groups, rules out pre-test differences between groups, so that differences at post-test can be attributed to the independent variable-parent involvement, in this case-with confidence. In order to conduct this type of study, a new level of partnership will need to be forged between practitioners and researchers to enable the use of experimental procedures in service settings, and program staff concerns related to random assignment and potentially intrusive data collection procedures will need to be addressed. Isolation of the Effects of Parent Involvement In order to truly understand and document the full impact of parent involvement, studies must separate parent involvement effects from related variables and from the impact of other adults involved in the program by: (1) specifically measuring a parent's involvement (i.e., type and level) separate from other components of the intervention in order to assess its independent impact on the identified outcomes, and (2) evaluating the differential influences of the content of a program and the deliverer (parent or other adult) of the program on outcomes. Clarification of the Definition of Parent Involvement Researchers must make explicit which aspect of involvement is being measured and how it fits into the broader construct of parent involvement in order to create a coherent understanding of the importance of different aspects of involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">To ease researchers' ability to compare their findings with the work of others, and to build upon existing knowledge in a systematic fashion, researchers will need to develop and validate common instruments for measuring parent involvement across a variety of settings. Drawing on Epstein's (1994) six-item classification system-covering school-home communications, parent involvement in school and community, home learning activities, and parents as decision-makers-might prove useful for developing such a measurement, as it provides a widely accepted typology of parent involvement. Objective Measurement of Parent Involvement Studies must use techniques such as direct observation of parental behavior with standardized data collection tools, since self-report data can be unreliable. Additional Study Design Improvements The following issues also require further attention in parent involvement research: Location of Parent Involvement. Research is needed to identify the unique and overlapping benefits of involvement at school and involvement in the home. It is clear from the existing knowledge base that involvement in these different ecological settings is not interchangeable, especially with respect to the barriers and goals of involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">Amount of Parent Involvement. The amount of involvement necessary to effect a positive impact on children needs to be identified. Questions regarding threshold effects of involvement (the minimum amount of involvement necessary to have an effect) and overload/ceiling effects (the saturation point of involvement) have yet to be adequately addressed. This is especially true for involvement at school, which may interact with other parental activities to increase parental stress and/or lead to overload. Thus, studies should attempt to determine the optimal amount of parent involvement. Further, it has not yet been determined whether quantity is the appropriate scale for assessing involvement. Quality of involvement (between parent and teachers and between parents and their children) may be a more important dimension for assessing the impact of parent involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">For example, if parents grudgingly read to their children, the effect may be more deleterious than their declining to do so. Comprehensiveness of Parent Involvement. More research is needed to determine whether parents need to be involved in all aspects of a parent involvement program (planning, implementation, evaluation) in order for their involvement to be valid and beneficial. Currently, some practitioners attempt to engage parents in all levels of school functioning or at all levels of implementation of a parent program within the school in the belief that the more comprehensive the involvement of parents, the greater the benefit to children's education. It may be that discrete and targeted types of involvement can also produce a positive impact. Complexity of Involvement Patterns. Researchers need to take into account the complex and transactional nature of interrelationships between parent involvement and its outcomes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">For example: (1) relationships among different types of parent involvement; (2) the relative importance of different aspects of parent involvement at different points in the life of the student; and (3) the complex processes by which different types of involvement interact to mediate, moderate, or suppress each other. Ancillary Beneficiaries of Parent Involvement. Much remains to be learned about the impact of discrete parent involvement activities and particular beneficiaries, such as the parents themselves, families, schools, and communities. For example, the impact of involvement in their children's education on parents' literacy, self-esteem, and feelings about their children has yet to be explored and documented. Similar detailed questions remain to be explored about the effects on the community of an active parent involvement program within the district public schools. Differential Gender Effects of Parent Involvement. It is important for research studies to consider from the outset the relationships between parent involvement and student achievement separated by gender.</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">Indeed, the research studies that have done so suggest that the specific aspects of parent involvement considered-parental styles and parenting techniques-have different effects depending upon the gender of the child. For example, Lobel and Bempechat (1992) found that mothers with a high need for social approval had sons with high performance expectations, although their daughters were not similarly affected. Conversely, Phillips (1992) found that parents' goals for their children's educational achievement was a stronger predictor of achievement gains for girls than for boys, and that parents of girls had higher expectations for their children's educational achievement than parents of boys. In order to study gender differentials, research will need to generate hypotheses about which types of parent involvement are likely to have different outcomes for boys and girls.

Consider closing the meeting by expanding the committee charged with developing this plan by adding a number of parents. It is important that parents be representative of the community. Remember, committees that are too large have difficulty functioning effectively. Develop the Plan At this point the committee can commence designing a plan to meet local needs that utilizes local resources. Important resources include: information from the staff meeting(s) and the public meeting(s), resources that have been identified earlier or gathered in support of the initiative, and the parents and teachers on the committee.</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">Assess the Plan Remember to assess the plan in terms of its original objectives. Stakeholders should be involved in the assessment. Cambridge Management Group Inc. Saskatchewan Education and Saskatchewan School Trustees Association. Research indicates that parent involvement is important. In the early 1960's, one of the very first studies on parent involvement was undertaken by James Coleman.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">The results of his work showed that the greatest contributors to student success in school and predictors of success in school were: the socioeconomic status of the parents how well educated the parents were, and how wealthy they were The more recent research that James Coleman has done, primarily in U.S. private schools, has led to a more useful understanding of parent involvement and the importance of reaching out to families at home and engaging them more directly in their children's education. There are many reasons why schools should and do encourage active parental participation in schools. Education is recognized as a responsibility shared by the school, the home, the community, and the church.</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">Recognition must be given to the broader community and the integral role they play in school success (Renihan &amp; Renihan, 1991). Student achievement is related to the extent to which parents are actively involved in and support their children's learning. Successful school development projects have been related to high levels of communication. There are a number of compelling reasons for promoting parent involvement in schooling: Parents have a legitimate right to be involved as partners in the education of their children. Parents can play an important advocacy role in winning support for school based initiatives. Parents can play an important role in the determination of school priorities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">Parents can contribute meaningfully in planning educational programs and policies. Parents are a valuable resource to school-based professionals, particularly in their ability to provide information on individual student learning problems, in identifying individual learning styles and idiosyncrasies, and in alerting professionals as to whether children need challenge or are at risk. "What Makes Parental Involvement Successful?" Forum participants shared the following key points: A welcoming climate must be developed A sense of mutual respect is essential Parents must share a common cause and a meaningful reason for being involved</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">A Welcoming Climate can be developed when we: Create a comfortable environment Recognize scepticism and fear around schools Provide a place for parents to have a "cup of tea" Reserve a school board spot Build and staff schools with thoughtful, caring administrators who are willing to make changes and teachers who take part and create a welcoming climate in every classroom Foster a positive attitude of openness, that allows people to change and develop positive attitudes toward schools</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">Incorporate Community schools concepts Encourage teachers to go to reserves to meet and visit with families Open the school to the community Create a culturally conducive school Foster and develop success, for success breeds success Empower parents--express an earnest, sincere desire to include parents Hold interviews at band offices, provide transportation</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">Serve food Train staff to welcome parent volunteers Open the library after hours to the community Invite parents to call teachers by their first name Use an integrated services approach to maximize use of the school facility Contact parents on a regular basis Have locally elected boards</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">View "religions" as "value systems" Respect can be demonstrated when we: View parents as partners Include Aboriginal people at various levels - administrators, teachers, aides Examine all decision-making structures--Avoid separating people by language and culture Increase flexibility in rules and legal issues, etc. Communicate respect fully and frequently</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">See the need for awareness and understanding of barriers and the challenges of change and crossing cultures Attend or host special cultural activities "Know ourselves and who our children are" Believe that cross-cultural education is for EVERYONE Although 'festival' approach may foster racism, cultural mosaics help to increase respect for self and others Parents Must Share a Common Cause and Reason for Involvement This can be developed through:</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">Curriculum and extra-curricular activities that reflect interests of parents.

Curriculum that is relevant to students and parents</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">John Barton, Principal of Princess Alexandra School, Saskatoon, was invited to share experiences regarding engaging parents in school learning at the forum. How can we help? As educators, our primary job is the academics. Of all the categories we surveyed, that area was the most surprising. When children were having good experiences with the liaison officer, they were going home and telling their parents about it. Changing our attire has enabled us to become more comfortable in the community and become more respected by the community. We needed to say, "How can we do some things differently?</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">We have to build that comfort zone where we can make mistakes, where we can go to our parents and say, "We're struggling with this. We don't know everything that there is to know about some of these subjects." Library open to the community at night. To effectively engage parents as partners; appropriate material, human, and financial resources must be available. It is time to "share the load". Productive partnerships are built through effective two-way communication which includes on-going dialogue and networking. Keep communication as open, as accessible, and as frequent as possible.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">Education and home-school partnerships are most effective were there is a conscious effort to building a community were learning is maximized. A sense of shared ownership is essential to developing commitment and responsibility. Schools must consciously reach out to parents and the broader community. Involve students in the community and the community in the classroom. It is important for the school to encourage community learning since people only support what they understand. Indicating the general public, teachers-in-training, and practising on how to recognize racism and respond to it. Community schools are required to have parent councils.</paragraph><paragraph parID="115">Because these schools have been established to combat the effects of inner city poverty and target an Aboriginal population, councils typically have a high proportion of Indian and M&#65533;tis parents. This does not occur by accident; rather the principal, community school coordinator, and community members actively encourage participation. The parent council works with the school staff, providing advice and counsel. It is an example of the agreement between the Saskatoon Separate Board of Education, the Province, and the parent-council. The Board of Education policy can also provide other mechanisms for Indian and M&#65533;tis parents to become more involved in educational governance. If we change some things, we become intentionally invitational, and we are focusing more on how we invite parents through the children. The children have good experiences at school and hopefully, the parents will feel better and that will encourage them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="116">Overcoming Restraining Forces and Barriers to Parent Involvement Forum participants offered the following suggestions: Allocation of resources indicates commitment and accountability. We need to rely more on human resources as financial resources diminish. Schools cannot keep expanding their mandates on unchanging budgets. It isn't a problem finding resources if the job is being done Communication and Networking - Beginning the Dialogue:</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">Parents will talk to anyone who will really listen--teachers, aides, librarians, resource room teachers, administrators Provide opportunities for people to learn names and get to know one another in many different ways. Building a community for learning: Stress efforts that encourage integration rather than segregation. Sporting and cultural events provide opportunities for bringing diverse communities together to support children and school goals. Open community and reserve functions to all. Political/Legislative Structures:</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">Review political and legislative structures to ensure that they are enabling and empowering for education in each community. Changes in legislation are necessary to increase communication. Facilitate communication through joint advisory boards and interagency committees. Meet together to discuss issues and direction. Diverse Perspectives: Effective schools will require understanding and compromise. Respectful understanding and two-way communication go a long way toward learning more about one another.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">Shared Ownership: Issues and tasks should be approached from a broader global perspective. Power sharing and realistic representation on committees and school boards develop shared ownership. Intentionally Inviting: Be aware that different things work in different communities. Clean and physically inviting schools with displays of student artwork and projects welcome visitors. Exemplify "Tawow"--"Welcome!</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">There is something for you here." This Cree word has appeared in other gatherings to express this ideal. Increasing Awareness: Provide opportunities for parents and teachers to exchange information and opinions to influence attitudes, and really LISTEN to one another. Eliminate Racism Racism is evident in the behaviours of some individuals and how the education system is organized. Suggestions include:</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">Participants at the 1993 Forum reviewed present governance structures and considered possible options for change. Current Government Structures Present initiatives in Saskatchewan include: Joe Duquette High School (originally called the Saskatoon Native Survival School) was established in 1980 by a group of Indian and M&#65533;tis parents who were concerned about the high drop-out rate among Aboriginal students. This group establishes how the school will be governed and funded. Parent involvement could be increased through decentralized school management. As a staff develop a rationale for increasing parental involvement</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">To be successful, a school initiative of this nature requires that active support and involvement of all staff members. This is particularly true if proposed changes may present a threat to individuals. The staff must understand why increasing parental involvement is an important initiative and how parents may be involved in the school. Remember, all schools currently involve parents in the school; you must build upon what exists. Activity: Devote a staff meeting to the answering the following questions: 1 How do we currently involve parents in the school? 2 Why would we want to increase parental participation in our school?</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">3 What resources are there in the school and the community that would assist us in this initiative? 4 What barriers are there to this initiative? You may wish to close the staff meeting by creating a committee to lead in the development of a school plan to increase parental involvement. Initially, the committee can synthesize the responses to these questions. Obtain division board and local board or parent council support for initiatives If children from a reserve attend your school, you will also want school committees, or band council support. You may want representatives from these groups on your committee.</paragraph><paragraph parID="124">Start at home to improve home-school relations. High school parent involvement: Relationships with achievement, grade level, SES, and gender. Parent involvement: Contributions of teacher efficacy, school socioeconomic status, and other school characteristics. In schools across the nation, teachers frequently point to the lack of parent involvement in their children's schooling as a major obstacle, particularly at the elementary and middle school levels. Educators in the Northwest Region are no exception. In the 2007/08 Schools and Staffing Survey, half (51 percent) of Northwest public school teachers rated "lack of parental involvement" as a moderate or serious problem, which was close to the national rate (52 percent). Eleven percent of Northwest public school teachers strongly disagreed that they "receive a great deal of support from parents" for the work they do, and 24 percent somewhat disagreed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="125">REL Northwest Studies This report addresses the fact that although the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 spells out parent involvement requirements for schools in need of improvement, the majority (54 percent) of the 84 percent of the Northwest Region school improvement plans reviewed by REL Northwest researchers failed to include such provisions. The researchers found that many schools rely on communication as the primary way to involve parents-despite the wide range of parent involvement practices discussed in the literature. Examining American Indian Perspectives in the Central Region on Parent Involvement in Children's Education This study examines American Indian parents' perceptions of parent involvement in their children's education and factors that may encourage or discourage involvement. Discouraging factors included feeling unwelcome or intimidated at the school, which was accompanied by perceptions of racism and discrimination; experiencing scheduling, transportation, childcare, and financial difficulties; and having prior negative experiences with their own or their children's education. Chartered in the Pacific Northwest in 1966 as Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, Education Northwest now conducts more than 200 projects annually, working with schools, districts, and communities on evidence-based solutions to the challenges they face. Having a say: Parent participation in decision-making', in Sociology of Education, Browne, R.K. &amp; Foster, L.E., (Ed.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="126">These goals are not very different from most chugakko in Japan, with the emphasis supposedly on character building, rather than academic results and reflect forms of Japanese Buddhist spirituality. Quality will have to be measured in different ways. (Copell and Henry 1977) One where the community is participating, the quality of student education is enhanced, and the teaching staff feel comfortable with the increased participation of the community. How can the community, school, and board of education move collectively from the present process of community 'involvement', to one of true 'participation' in the day to day activities and running of the school? However, Monbusho (1981) allows schools flexibility in activities and hours by stating that schools may much make such determination "...in the light of the distinctive characteristics of each school and each community." Initially the school and board of education would need to be convinced of the need, and support it. However, the Japanese are loath to speak out, so therefore I think an excellent first step would be the distribution of a questionnaire, both about needs and proposals for greater participation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="127">"...anonymity which encourages parents to feel they can say what they feel without fear of repercussion, it can be completed anytime, it can be brief, and the respondent has the chance to think carefully before answering". Whichever procedure is used the school must ensure that a mechanism is in place, "...whereby the needs of the community can be monitored". This paper is based on experiences gleaned from the author's two year tenure (1995-1997) as a teacher in the community of Omi-machi (Blue Sea Town, hereafter referred to as Omi), Japan. However some books, such as those by Kaigo (1965), Amano and Aso (1972), Kobayashi (1975), and Fujita (1978) show that there has been much continuity of educational methods in Omi over the last thirty years, aside from the growing use of technology. This is born out in the case study of Nichu chugakko (Junior High School) by John Singleton (1967). Japan is an ancient country with deeply rooted folkways and mores. It has successfully brought low unemployment, divorce and crime rates, plus large spending on education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="128">Unfortunately this is due to change over the next ten to twenty years as a huge transformation (due to economic imperatives and other socio-economic factors) is forced upon society. This school, like so many others, must "...begin to operate in a mode consistent with the future rather than with the past." (Beare &amp; Slaughter 1993) Therefore, in this paper options will be canvassed that perhaps will ease the pain of this change - using Omi as a micro example. It is hoped not to impose ethno-centric assumptions of superior thought, but will attempt to put forward a model that, working within the theory of nihonjinron ('Japaneseness'), can be embraced and 'owned' by the community. To understand education in any context we must study it as it is - deeply rooted ". in the culture of which it is an integral part and which it serves." The Japanese idea of how a community best functions can briefly be expressed thus,</paragraph><paragraph parID="129">"...their behaviour is influenced by an awareness of the order and rank of each person. The Japanese put much importance on harmony..." (Honen 1988) But while group harmony may be pre-eminent, it does not ensure 'community' as such. Neither does it mean that problems will be recognised and/or satisfactorily remedied. This will be further discussed later in this paper. Parental and school roles are seen as less intertwined, and parents are not inclined (or encouraged) to truly participate in the running of schools. The classic 'nuclear' family is the norm, with few single parent families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="130">As a rule of thumb, there would be only one or two children in each classroom who come from a single parent household. There are no special support programs for students and all students are required to be a member of a school club which meets out of school hours (basketball, kendo, English, baseball, tennis, brass band, etc.) The student population is very stable with only a few students (three or four) lost each year, generally due to the work transfer of a parent employed by Denka (see community profile). This Miami Herald brings up some really interesting issues around school involvement and family policies fr our businesses. Im a huuuuge involvement fan and the love the thought of more parents at school for confeneces and meetings and volunteering. We live in an instant society. Today's kids don't even want to wait for micro-waved food!

Say things like, "Baking cookies was fun but the job isn't over until we wash the dishes." Parent/teacher conferences are scheduled during teacher planning times so as                   not to disrupt instructional time. In the event the parent is unable to meet during               this time, the school covers the classroom to release the teacher. B.      Teachers have voicemail and email posted on the school website. The principal, assistant principal and guidance counselors are available to meet            with parents at anytime during the day and will make arrangements to meet with           parents after school hours if necessary. Provide parents opportunities to volunteer in their children's school and to          participate in their children's class and observe classroom activities, as follows:</paragraph><paragraph parID="132">A.     Volunteers are welcomed at our school. Notes are sent out via the school's               volunteer coordinator to encourage parent participation. B.

Planning a job and carrying it through. Teach your children to finish what they start.</paragraph><paragraph parID="134">Involving parents in their children's formal education improves student achievement. Parent involvement is most effective when it is comprehensive, long-lasting, and well-planned. The benefits of parent involvement are not confined to early childhood or the elementary level. There are strong positive effects from involving parents continuously throughout high school. Involving parents in their own children's education at home is not enough. To ensure the quality of schools as institutions serving the community, parents must be involved at all levels in the school. Children from low-income and minority families have the most to gain when schools involve parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="135">Parents do not have to be well-educated to help. We cannot look at the school and the home in isolation from one another. We must see how they interconnect with each other and with the world at large. Help Your Child Strive for Good Attendance Research shows that the single most important factor contributing to student achievement is school attendance. A student who is absent from school may be able to copy missed notes. However, other important aspects of the lessons are for lost forever.</paragraph><paragraph parID="136">Absent students miss out on discussion, raised questions, explanations and much more. Students fall behind and sometimes do not recover. To support good school attendance: Talk with your child about the importance of attending school regularly. Avoid scheduling family trips or doctor appointments during school hours. Make sure your student eats healthy foods and gets enough sleep and exercise. Don't accept excuses for why your child "must" miss or be late for school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="137">Discuss what happened at school each day. Support school rules and consequences for skipping class and being tardy. Provide incentives for improving school attendance and promptness. Parents Can Help if Their Child is Having a Problem in School If your child is having problems in school, there are ways you can help. Here are some of them: Talk with your child's teacher.</paragraph><paragraph parID="138">Learn about the studying your child is expected to do. Ask how you can help at home. Give study tips. Teach your child how to make an outline or explain that cramming for a test isn't as effective as studying over several nights. Expect success. Children are more likely to do well if parents believe in them. Say things like, "I know that you can do it."</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">Relate homework to real life. Mention how writing skills have helped you at work. Use specific praise. Kids need to hear exactly what they're doing right. For example, "God job! You've finished that project on time because you planned ahead." Ask to see graded assignments.</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">Talk about the teacher's marks and notes. Compliment your child's progress. Show interest. Ask frequently about what your child is studying. Send the message that schoolwork is important and interesting. Have a Successful Parent-Teacher Conference Parent-teacher conferences are one of the most important ways you can learn about your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">In these conferences, you can see how well you child is doing. You can meet the teacher face to face so that he/she can understand your child better. You can also ask for suggestions that will make it easier for you and the school to work together throughout the year. Here are four tips that can help you have a more successful parent-teacher conference. Plan for it. * What are my child's strengths and weaknesses? Keep an open mind.</paragraph><paragraph parID="142">Your goal is to work for cooperation between you and your child's teacher. Even if the teacher says something you disagree with, try to listen to what he has to say. Later, you can add your own thoughts. Ask to see your child's work. There is no better way to see how your child is progressing than to look at his school work. You can judge for yourself whether you child is making progress. Ask for suggestions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="143">If your child is doing well, ask what you can do to keep things on a positive track. If there are problems, ask what you can do to help. If a teacher identifies problems, ask for ways you can work together to solve the problem. If ideas are not shared immediately, ask for a follow-up conference. Make Homework Time More Productive Setting a regular homework time is one of the most important ways to help your child use time wisely. Having a regular homework time lets your child know that schoolwork is a priority in your family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">It also avoids those "I'll study after this TV show" arguments. Below are some tips on make homework time more productive. Enforce your rule about a regular time for homework. You may want to tell your child, "No TV until your homework is finished." Have a regular place for your child to do homework. Use a desk or a table in a quiet room. During homework time, turn off the TV and radio.</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">Before your child begins, talk with him about his assignments. Help him plan how he will use his time. Set a good example. While your child is doing homework, spend some time reading or working yourself. Then when homework is done, you can both talk about how much that you both have accomplished. When Should You Call the Teacher? If despite your best efforts your child isn't studying well, it is important to contact the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="146">As a team, you can work to solve the problem. Here are some signs that it is time to call the teacher: Your child refuses to study no matter what you say or do. You and your child do not understand homework instructions. It seems impossible for your child to get organized. Assignments are usually too hard or too easy for your child. Your child has missed a lot of school and assignments.</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">A personal problem is affecting your child's ability to study. You have never talked with the teacher about how to help your child study. These "Basics" Make Learning Possible...   And They're Learned at Home We hear a lot of talk about teaching children basic skills but before kids can learn reading, writing, and arithmetic, they need other basic skills. Here are some important basics your kids need to know and how you can teach these skills at home. How to pay attention. Kids have an amazing ability to tune out anything they don't want to hear.</paragraph><paragraph parID="148">That's frustrating enough at home but it can be even worse at school. Before you talk to your child, speak his name. Make sure he is looking at you when you speak. Show your child that studying helps people in and out of school. Review with your child. Ask your child practice questions, call out spelling words, or show him/her flash cards. Before you come to your conference, write out some questions that you would like to ask.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">Here are some suggestions: * Does my child get along with others? * How is my child's behavior in class? * Does my child read at the level you would expect for this grade? * Is my child able to do the math that you would expect for a student at this grade? (You will want to share your ideas about this  as well). Be sure there is plenty of light. Abstract Parent involvement programs have been assumed to be important contributors to elementary school children's educational success.</paragraph><paragraph parID="150">These programs include direct parent involvement outside school hours, parent volunteer programs in the classroom, parent attendance and participation in non-academic activities (e.g., PTO, fund raising, etc.). For many years researchers, educators, parent groups, and policy makers have debated whether or not parent involvement has a beneficial effect on the academic achievement of children. Objective The purpose of this review was to summarize the most dependable evidence on the effect of parental involvement for improving the academic performance of elementary school age children in grades K-6. The most dependable evidence was defined as studies that include at least two groups and use random assignment to form a fair comparison between groups. Main Results This review found that parent involvement had a positive and significant effect on children's overall academic performance. The effect was educationally meaningful and large enough to have practical implications for parents, family involvement practitioners, and policymakers. When parents participated in academic enrichment activities with their children outside of school for an average of less than 12 weeks, children demonstrated an equivalent of 4 to 5 months improvement in reading or math performance [From plain language summary of the study, which is available for download at: http://www.ilru.org/html/training/webcasts/archive/2006/11-02-SEDL.html ]</paragraph><paragraph parID="151">Background The importance of parent involvement in children's overall development is largely unquestioned. However, the impact of parent involvement on children's academic achievement is less certain. This meta-analysis* defines parent involvement as "the active engagement of a parent with their child outside of the school day in an activity which centers on enhancing academic performance." Parent involvement interventions in these studies included teaching parents to play math and reading games with their children, to provide rewards or incentives for school performance, to read collaboratively with their children, or to engage their children in math or science related activities outside of school. Research Questions Does parent involvement result in an improvement in children's academic performance?

Duration of Intervention</paragraph><paragraph parID="153">The average effect of parent involvement on children's achievement across the academic areas of math, reading, and science using a fixed effects model was 0.43; using a random effects model, the effect size* increased slightly to 0.45. The effect of parent involvement outside of school on children's academic performance in school is significant enough to have practical implications for parents, educators, administrators, and policy makers. Ah, the life of a Science Goddess. And, oh, the frustrations of Blogger when your post is eaten and you have to try to recapture your thoughts. It's been an incredibly busy two days this week. We have about 400 sophomore students at our school, all of whom will be taking the tests. We sent invitations via postcard to all of their families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="154">We also invited parents of 9th graders who will be coming to our school. Passing the tests is more critical for them, because if they don't, they can't graduate. We also extended an invitation to Juniors and their families, as those students can elect to retake the tests for better scores. The scores appear on their transcripts, even if they aren't required for graduation. And, we even advertised the event in the local paper. So, let's say that 1000 families were invited to attend. We had representatives from 4 of them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="155">I really could go off on a rant here...and perhaps will at some point in this merry blog...but I refuse to believe that parents aren't interested in the education of their children. I have to think that whatever we're doing to encourage parent participation just isn't cutting it. Why is it so hard to get parents of teens to engage more with the school? I know that kids don't always think it's "cool" to have mom and/or dad show up at school...but at a parent night, the kids need not even show up. Nobody has to know whose parents are whose. Anyway, I got home about 9, had a few hours of sleep, and then took the bus to the ferry...across the sound to the big city for a 2-day conference. I went to three sessions today, one of which was wonderful.</paragraph><paragraph parID="156">I slept through about half of the third one, but by that point, I already knew I wasn't going to miss anything. Meanwhile, I've left my charges in the hands of a substitute (a/k/a "guest") teacher. That is always a real crapshoot. In this state, they have to be certificated teachers...people who are actually licensed to be in a classroom. But let me tell ya', in most cases, it's pretty easy to see why they don't get a permanent position. Most are unorganized...they don't follow the plan that is left...I've had several that don't like kids and are rude to my students. The one I usually get these days is a retired teacher from our building.</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">He's deaf as a post and proceeds to fill the kids' heads with a lot of misinformation...because he doesn't bother to stay current. Due to my Science Goddess position, I'm out of the classroom a lot more than I would like to be. However, I try to never be gone during the first month of school while I entrain the kids. Being out a day here or there for the rest of the year is usually not too much of a problem. Not the best option (as I am doing this week), but with some preparation, it can be okay.

They did their business and afterward, I listened to the cook and bar man talk about this noble gesture. I sat there thinking about this little scene while I pretended to read my book. It was a wonderful gesture on the part of the parents. As teachers, we often get gifts from families (although not $75 worth of steak and wine). Genuine appreciation is such a rarity and all the more meaningful when you receive it as an educator. I just hope these parents help their son to remember that he received a lot of support and gifts along the way.</paragraph><paragraph parID="160">More than 90 percent of the schools in Fairfax, Arlington and Montgomery counties have PTAs, for instance, compared with about 25 percent nationally. But even here, there are worrisome signs for the future of the PTA. "I think it's time we join the nation," Catherine Potter, Woodson High PTSA's past president, told the assembled parents and a few jersey-clad students last week. She argued that the national group is too bureaucratic and less relevant in the Internet age, when parents have access to education-related news from Richmond or Washington and can get involved politically in other ways. While I'm not so sure that "the rest of the nation is jumping off a bridge, so we should, too" argument is the best reasons for disbandment, I do think one of the key pieces here is the "Internet age." That being said, organizations like the PTA are only as relevant as they choose to be. PTA leaders say they are struggling to communicate their message to a new generation of parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="161">"The question is, 'What have you done for me lately?' " said Michele Menapace, president of the Fairfax County Council of PTAs. "And we need to do a better job telling them" that the PTA is involved in issues they care about... Nehrbass, of the Virginia PTA, said it's getting harder to convince parents that it matters to be involved in issues affecting more than their children or their school. Working alone, for instance, parents can raise money for a computer their school cannot afford because of budget cuts, she said. Working together, they can fill a boardroom to fight for more education funding. To reverse the decline in membership, the national PTA is trying to redraw the face of children's advocacy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="162">It's reaching out to fathers and training minority leaders to organize growing numbers of immigrant parents. It is also appealing to younger parents through social networking sites. The elementary school I was a part of two years ago had a terrible time trying to sustain its PTA. Whether it was the dues (a "luxury" for a family living in poverty), the meetings (when parents were working two jobs and/or relying on public transportation and/or had no one to watch the children), or just an aversion to being in a school, I don't know. The species had been cataloged long before I picked up a piece of chalk and cranked a mimeograph, but it represented only a small subpopulation of parents (both male and female). I rarely observed this type of parent in my science classroom; however, it was not uncommon to make field observations in performing arts classes and at athletics events. To be sure, we cannot weed out helicopter parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="163">Po Bronson thinks that native parenting types may be making a comeback--- A Return of Tough Love . It means that while parents should continue to want the best for their children, they have to realize that advocacy does not mean your child gets each and every thing you want. After reading the interview, I have to say that the comments by readers are far more interesting than the article itself; however, I have still enjoyed the "What if's..." generated for me. Here's the final piece of the interview printed by SciAm: LEHRER: You emphasize the importance of teachers in shaping a child's development. How can we apply this new theory of child development to public policy? HARRIS: I've put together a lot of evidence showing that children learn at home how to behave at home (that's where parents do have power!)</paragraph><paragraph parID="164">, and they learn outside the home how to behave outside the home. So if you want to improve the way children behave in school-for instance, by making them more diligent and less disruptive in the classroom-then improving their home environment is not the way to do it. What about all of the teachers in his K-12 career who taught him to read, write, and think critically---skills that will serve him in the decades of his life after his scholarship is gone? Through the years, Washington's inner suburbs have been high-profile exceptions to the general decline. If the PTA is going to evade a dinosaur-like ending to its existence, it is going to have to adapt to the changing form of the American family, as well as the shifting landscape of how people organize and communicate. Teachers, coaches, and administrators received many a pitying glance after coming in contact with the stage mother in his/her native habitat. What was it about the environment which changed to allow them to become so pervasive?</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">What happened in school settings that allowed them to use their opportunistic behaviors in new ways? Stage Mothers will never become extinct, but perhaps we can discourage their growth and abundance. When that happens, the differences between the groups widen: the pro-school group does well, but the anti-school group falls further and further behind. A classroom with 40 kids is more likely to split up into opposing groups than one with 20, which may explain why students tend to do better in smaller classes. It does echo some of the things I've been reading about student motivation. Students will adapt their behaviors to be in line with whatever the teacher emphasizes: valuing learning...or valuing grades. It would appear that "assimilating" a couple of students would be easier than several kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="166">But the classroom is a different sort of place: whatever baggage each of us brings from our homes has to some how fuse and meld into a larger social contract. One of the things I like best about the internet is the diversity of readily available source material. And while there is an author behind each piece who is trying to make some sense of a particular idea, from my "user" state, I get the fun part of seeing connections between the disparate pieces. The study assessed population-level risk factors by linking birth records of 12-14-year-old children in Florida with their respective public school records, over the course of a school year. Using the rationale that high-prevalence risk factors can have a substantial impact at the population level, even if the risk to the individual is low, the researchers found that low maternal education resulted in the highest risk of intellectual disability to offspring compared with other factors such as maternal illness, delivery complications, gestational age at birth, and even very low birth weight. Extremely low birth weight infants (less than 2.2 lbs) were 9.1 times more likely to have a mild intellectual disability compared to normal birth weight infants (5.5 lbs), yet were only associated with 2.1% of cases in the population. As if the quote wasn't amusing enough, try this on for kicks and giggles: the DA sent out letters to 582 parents of consistently truant students...and 41% didn't show up for the meeting with him.</paragraph><paragraph parID="167">Hours are added onto my workload each year by just a few students who want to do things at their convenience, as opposed to getting up in the morning and coming to school like the rest of us. What I will say is the parents of incoming sophomores have the first crop of kids who will multiple accountability measures factored into their graduation: Did they pass the state tests? I personally don't believe that most 15 year-olds are ready for a college level class. For the most part, the school trusts parents as the district trusts teachers: if you say your kid can't come to school, then we'll assume it's because of some sort of personal emergency. What school will initiate legal action against families for keeping their kids home, even though the school should do its part to ensure the child has access to an education? So, here I sit in the middle of the night, bothered because I am physically unable to do my part later today to help my kids...and yet we have a number of parents who won't be bothered if their kids take a 3-day (or more) weekend frequently throughout the year. I explained that I had offered for her son to take the class "Pass/Fail."</paragraph><paragraph parID="168">I wonder sometimes if parents, students, and teachers are in agreement about what homework "looks like." It's ridiculous that kids have to explain their reasoning on the test. No one has to do that in the real world. You just call someone and get an answer. That's all that matters. How about moms who are more worried about how their sons are going to be able to go to weight training for football with this pesky math class interfering? I have quite the call log going.</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">But the other part is simply a way to document all of this in case these same parents want to sue the school district for not helping their children to graduate. There is a job posting right now for someone to do this job full-time. I've been asked to sit in on the interviews. It will be really good to pass along all of this (especially the TMI tidbits) to someone else...especially the phone calls. That way, he would still have credit, it would show up on his transcript, but it wouldn't impact his GPA. Her stance is that if he isn't earning a grade, what's the point in taking a class? The kid would be happy to stay in and take the class Pass/Fail.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">With only two months to go until The Test (not that he's planning on taking it), we are very nearly done with our curriculum. Why "quit" now? We'll see what happens. I talked to his counselor so that she would know the situation the kid is in and I guess we'll go from there. I'm hoping that this will be the first and last time I run across this sort of dilemma. However, "most children aged 9, 13 and 17 years say they spend less than an hour a night on homework, according to a long-term federal study. That load has held steady, if not dropped, over the past 20 years.</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">Plenty of students say they are not assigned any homework at all." Does it have to involve a paper and pencil task? Could it be reviewing notes or reading in the text? Some of these point to the amount assigned. I do think that practice is important for any of us faced with learning new information. Different kinds of assignments can help make new neural connections and strengthen old ones. I admit that I don't assign a lot of homework to my students.</paragraph><paragraph parID="172">However, I do expect them to read and revise notes on an ongoing basis. I didn't have an opportunity to take an AP class in high school, so I really don't know how my expectations compare with the real experience. I remember spending about 45 minutes a day (on average) on homework in high school. I don't think 90 minutes is such a terrible expectation---that's about 15 minutes per class per day for a student. I'd bet that many students out there would disagree. Yesterday was busy, but I had lots of nice compliments on my school board presentation---including ones from the superintendent and one of the board members. There are also some other comments starting to bubble up: If kids take more science, what classes will they not be taking?</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">We knew these would come. There were lots of tables in the "fair": local banks, girl scouts, school districts, support agencies, etc. A free dinner was prepared. Four families showed up. That was certainly no lie. I felt rather embarrassed for the organizers of the event. This is someting I've blogged about before .</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">Maybe it's just a matter of providing a good environment so that kids can come to school, ready to learn. And we'll take things from there. After two sixteen-hour days in a row, I'm ready for a break. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's glad to see Friday on the calendar. Welcome back, old friend. Each "period" is ten minutes in length. These bits of information help them connect with things in their own lives.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">Practice problems? Sometimes this is an accurate reflection. Take a moment to talk about your most important classroom procedures, but don't spend the bulk of your time here. Hand them a syllabus. They can read it later. (Their child might!) Only some will attend the event, I realize, but at least it is a start to knowing these families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="176">We'll have the next ten months to fill in the details. The idea that they're paying $40,000 for their child's education somehow gives them a sense of entitlement to complain about anything they don't like. It makes me wonder about a couple of things. One---what is their purpose in sending the kid to college? Is it only to obtain a piece of paper saying that a degree was earned? And secondly, when do they plan to teach the child that the answer to every problem isn't "call mommy and daddy"? "At Colgate, parents used to receive a sheet listing administrators' phone numbers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="177">The approach will continue throughout the year, part of a larger emphasis at Colgate on 'teachable moments' outside the classroom. A memo sent to departments ranging from residential life to counseling to public safety reminds employees: 'We will not solve problems for students because it robs students of an opportunity to learn.'" I know all too well what the "not enough" looks like...and I have had a couple of experiences with the "too much" variety. My school is now doing its "Open House" night before the start of the school year. We started this last year and there seem to be several advantages to this format. New students have a chance to follow their schedule before the first day of school. Teachers get to talk with parents about classroom expectations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="178">The parents who attend, that is. We usually get about 15 - 20% of our target population. This seems rather paltry when you consider that we have 1200 families who are part of our school. I know that evenings can be a struggle for a family's schedule. Parents can be tired after a day of work. Perhaps there are little ones still at home. There may be other commitments already on the calendar.</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">But does that account for 80 - 85% "no shows"? We are not the only school struggling with ways to get more parents involved with our school. (This would include more than just Open House.) According to a recent article in the Orlando Sentinel , "Increasingly, public schools are turning to the wacky and whimsical -- and anything else they can dream up -- to push parents into getting more involved in schools and their kids' lives. The reason: Children whose parents do everything from simply talking to their kids to showing up for school meetings have better grades, improved attendance and less chance of dropping out, among other things." Why are so few parents participating in the school at a time when the stakes have never been higher? So, what are the barriers---and what can we do about them?</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">"Eighty-two percent of teachers surveyed in 2004 by Public Agenda, a nonprofit group that conducts public-policy research, said parents' failure to teach their children discipline is a major problem and more than half said teachers often go easy on students because they don't feel supported by parents." Meanwhile, "Parents are strapped for time, and they often feel unwelcome or intimidated by their own lack of education..." So, they're worried that we're going to make them feel stupid...and we're worried that they won't take our role in their childrens' lives seriously. If we took the time to really talk about this, we'd likely find that we've all had a bad experience: either as a student or as a teacher calling a parent for support. But somehow, many of us have extended that experience to our further interactions. It's stifling our ability to reach out to one another. I also think that too often we expect parents to come to the schoolhouse door---and yet we don't make an effort to come to them. Maybe we should think about holding meetings in apartment complexes or subdivisions once in awhile.</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">I have also heard of districts which make a second bus run on certain days of the year in order to pick up parents and bring them to school...supposedly with grand results. The article in the Sentinel has an interesting tidbit: a school which used "door prizes and pizza" to lure parents in for a meeting had a turnout rate of 75% of the families. If 75% can show up for meetings, pizza, and door prizes (even those who have been at work all day, have young children, etc.)...why can only 15% show up if there's no extra incentives? Why isn't helping your child in their education enough of a motivation? The bottom line is simply that we need parents as an integral part of our schools. NCLB may have laid student achievement at the footsteps of educators, but we can't do it alone. Every year, my principal shakes his head and asks for ideas to help increase parental involvement with our school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="182">We provide various ideas (like moving Open House to an earlier date) and see if it works. But it's not enough. Teachers have lower expectations for students with names like Da'Quan because they assume the parents who choose names with unusual letter combinations and apostrophes are poorly educated. But teachers did not have the same low expectations for siblings with more mainstream names. The research goes beyond distinctly black names. In other papers also on track to being published, it is asserted that girls of all races with feminine-sounding names, such as Rebecca or Elizabeth, are less likely to enroll in high-level math and science classes. Studies have also found 263 ways to spell Caitlin or Katelynn, mostly among white parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="183">The further away someone gets from the two most common spellings, the more likely the girl is to have trouble reading when she reaches third or fourth grade. Shouldn't we (parents and teachers) be reinforcing with students that school is important? That attendance is important? For those schools and districts with attendance policies (such as "miss more than 10 days and you lose credit for the course), I doubt they have to confront this issue very much. I must admit I'm a little jealous of that. Earlier in the school year, I saw a similar story to this one , where teachers were asked to mark papers using a colour other than red. Parents were complaining that the self-esteem of their children was being damaged because of papers marked in red.</paragraph><paragraph parID="184">It's apparently too stressful for a student to see even positive comments written with a red pen. Some interesting research published recently seems to indicate that a student's name does play a role in the classroom in terms of teacher expectations. And it's a simple way to remove any expectations I have based on previous performance to a current assignment. The mother also went on to point out that her son will have completed all of his AP tests by that point...and implied that would mean he wouldn't miss anything important by being gone. National Study Links Father's Involvement To Children Getting A's In School According to a new national study, children do better in school when their fathers are involved in their schools, whether their fathers live with them or their mothers are also involved. "This study provides hard evidence about the powerful and positive influence that parents can have as full and equal partners when they make the commitment to help their children get a good education," Vice President Gore said.</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">"Fathers matter a great deal when it comes to helping their children succeed in school and this study should encourage millions of American fathers to step up to the plate and make a difference in their children's education." According to the study, fathers can be a positive force in their children's education, and when they do get involved, their children are more likely to get mostly A's in school. The study also shows that fathers in two-parent families are less likely than mothers to be very involved in their children's schools. "This study tells me that if America's Dads got as involved as America's Moms in their children's education, America's children would be studying harder and getting a lot more A's," said U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley. "Dads make a powerful difference in defining expectations and challenging children to do their best." Overall, children in two-parent families where the father is are highly involved get better grades, enjoy school more and are less likely to repeat a grade, compared with those in which only mothers are highly involved. The findings come from a new report, Fathers' Involvement in Their Children's Schools, which provides data from the National Center for Education Statistics's 1996 National Household Education Survey of the parents of 16,910 kindergartners through 12th-graders.</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">The report emphasizes fathers' involvement in their children's schools, but information on mothers' involvement is also included. According to the study, mothers and fathers are more likely to be highly involved in their children's schools if the schools welcome parental involvement and make it easy for parents to be involved. Parental involvement is also higher if classroom and school discipline are maintained and if teachers and students respect one another. Children who live in two-parent families are more likely to get mostly A's, regardless of the level of the mothers' involvement. Children who live in single-parent families headed by fathers are twice as likely to get mostly A's if their fathers are highly involved at school, compared with those whose fathers have little (none or only one school activity) involvement. While non-custodial fathers are less likely (only 31 percent participate in any school activity) to participate at school than custodial fathers, when they are involved, they make a difference, particularly for children in grades six and above. Their children are much more likely to get A's , enjoy school, participate in extracurricular activities and are less likely to repeat a grade.</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">In two-parent families, the report indicates, the proportion of children with highly involved fathers is about half the proportion of those with highly involved mothers (27 percent and 56 percent, respectively). Fathers in single-parent families have a powerful role to play in keeping their children out of trouble and on the right track. The study shows their school involvement reduces the likelihood of their children's suspension or expulsion. In two-parent families, mothers' involvement reduces the likelihood that their children will be suspended or expelled. "Highly involved fathers and mothers almost double the odds of good things happening in their children's education," said Riley. "This is why I urge America's schools to redouble their current efforts to reach out to mothers and fathers." The study shows that fathers of more than half of the K-12 children participate at their children's school at a moderate (two activities per year) or high (three of more activities per year) level.</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">The study also found that: In single-parent families, children living with single fathers or single mothers are about equally likely to have highly involved parents, 46 percent and 49 percent respectively. When fathers have primary responsibility for raising their children, they are almost as involved in school activities as mothers in either two- or single-parent families. And the involvement of single parents -- both mothers and fathers -- is similar to that of mothers in two-parent families. Families with high parental involvement in their children's schools are more likely to visit a library, museum or historical site with their children, and are more likely to have high educational expectations for their children. The survey is one of the first bodies of research that looks at the individual contributions of mothers and fathers in their children's education. Fathers have in the past been overlooked in research, but in 1995 President Clinton asked all executive departments to include fathers in their programs, policies and research, where possible.</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">The report is based on interviews with the parents of nearly 17,000 kindergartners through 12th graders. The study controlled for other factors that have been associated with a child's school success such as race and ethnicity, parents' education and family income. Parents were asked which adult in the household had participated in four types of school activities since the beginning of the school year: attending a general school meeting; attending a regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference; attending a school or class event; and volunteering at the school. About Elementary School Parent-Teacher Conferences What is a Parent-Teacher conference? Parent-Teacher conferences are scheduled to be an exchange of ideas about your child's activities, habits, experiences, and achievements. While parents receive interim reports (grades 1- 5) and are encouraged to discuss specific concerns at any time, the parent-teacher conference presents an opportunity for parents and teachers to meet in person at regular intervals to discuss the child's progress.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">Nevertheless, special circumstances may require scheduling a conference before school hours or late in the afternoon. What should parents expect from a Parent-Teacher conference? an opportunity to get to know your child's teacher in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere an opportunity to hear about your child's progress in academic, social, and emotional development and to learn about strengths and special abilities a chance to establish mutual goals with your child's teacher to give additional support in areas needing improvement a chance to share important information with the teacher which will be helpful in understanding your child's needs Getting ready for the conference: you can help!</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">You will receive a confirmation to attend a conference with your child's teacher. If you have a specific concern you would like to address at your conference, please let the teacher know in advance so s/he can prepare. To help the teacher understand your child better, you may wish to discuss such things as: important experiences that may be affecting your child (death in the family, divorce, a best friend moving away, relationships with family members, etc.) any special health needs/problems after school activities, special interests and hobbies feelings about school</paragraph><paragraph parID="192">study habits T.V. habits anything at all that could be affecting your child Remember- it is not necessary to reveal personal information, but anything you say will be kept confidential.

The teacher may also suggest other resources such as reading material on a topic of interest. Helpful hints Please be on time. Try to follow the schedule which has been set up. If you feel you need more time, ask about setting up another conference at a future date.</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">Call the school if a last minute emergency prevents you from coming at the scheduled time. Check with your child's teacher about arranging a special conference time if the times and dates are difficult for you and your schedule. Please keep in mind the parent-teacher conference is scheduled to exchange information about your child and the curriculum at the grade level. The parent-teacher conference is not the time for a general discussion of educational philosophy, nor is it the time to discuss the ability, style or program of another teacher. When the conference is over You should have a better understanding of all aspects of your child's school experience. You should know more about your child's:</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">academic, social and emotional development strengths and areas of growth that are needed special abilities current performance Discussing the conference with your child The teacher may involve your child in preparing for the conference, perhaps by selecting samples of work to show you. Before the conference, you can help relieve any anxiety your child may have by discussing areas you may cover.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">Afterwards, talk about what was discussed (omitting any information your child may not be mature enough to understand). Be sure to talk about any changes or new plans implemented at the conference. Try to be positive! The better children feel about themselves, the better they will do in school.

One important initiative was the implementation of Personalised Learning Plans (PLPs) for all Aboriginal students in Years 7-12.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">In the past we didn't have a lot of contact with the Aboriginal parents, and sometimes the contact we did have was only for negative reasons, like suspensions or other discipline matters. It seemed a good fit for us because we thought that a facilitator could help guide us through getting in touch with the parents and community in a positive way. The first thing was to set up an Aboriginal Education Committee, with a membership of about six or seven people, but open to anyone to come along. And we worked with Ray on quite a few plans, but firstly we tried to make the parents comfortable about coming to the school for informal meetings rather than big events. What we really wanted to know was what the parents wanted for their kids. So this all fed into developing Personalised Learning Programs for all our Aboriginal students. When we're looking at particular subject areas, though, we involve the appropriate teachers as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">We do ask for written contributions from teachers . This way, we actually find out a lot more about the students and their interests and to start with, we usually set small, achievable goals in their actual Personalised Learning Plans . For those who have recently finished NAPLAN tests in Years 7 and 9 we're able to look closely at those results and target specific areas. We've been able to help students understand clearly where there are gaps in their learning, and what they need to do to improve. First of all you have to be persistent and realise that many parents have complicated lives and it's difficult for them to make commitments in advance. California Parent Information Resource Center (PIRC) The California Parent Information Resource Center (PIRC) 2 helps parents become more involved in their children's education and assists schools with the implementation of successful and effective parental involvement policies and programs that lead to improvements in student academic achievement.

Parenting , in which schools help families with their parenting skills by providing information on children's developmental stages and offering advice on learning-friendly home environments; Communicating , or working to educate families about their child's progress and school services and providing opportunities for parents to communicate with the school; Volunteering , which ranges from offering opportunities for parents to visit their child's school to finding ways to recruit and train them to work in the school or classroom; Learning at home , in which schools and educators share ideas to promote at-home learning through high expectations and strategies so parents can monitor and help with homework. Decision-making , in which schools include families as partners in school organizations, advisory panels, and similar committees. Community collaboration , a two-way outreach strategy in which community or business groups are involved in education and schools encourage family participation in the community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">National survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that attending school meetings or events is the leading form of parent participation in schools, followed by school fundraising activities. For older students, parent involvement with academics largely focused on enabling parents to convey high expectations to their children, encouraging them to take and succeed in rigorous courses with an eye toward college. "School, family, and community partnerships can boost attendance and increase achievement slightly, but excellent classroom teaching will be needed to dramatically improve students' writing, reading, and math skills to meet the state's standards." This might be accomplished through discussions, flyers, meetings or other strategies.

There are an enormous number of kinds which contribute to absorbing into your brain (learning) in a manner that enables the stuff eventually to be used (whatever that means subject to subject).

Physician Teaches Parents Osteopathic Techniques that Soothe Earaches in Children STRATFORD - It's late at night and earache pain is keeping your young child from falling asleep. Short of calling a pediatrician's answering service or a trip to the emergency room, what's a parent to do? In his Family Medicine practice in Hainesport, Dr. David Mason, acting chair of the Department of Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine at the UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine, provides an answer. The techniques often will provide enough relief to allow the child to rest until a trip to the physician's office can be arranged.</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">"Done properly, these techniques will - in a matter of minutes - help the fluid to drain through the child's Eustachian tubes, reducing pressure and relieving pain. It won't cure the cause of the infection but it will relieve the acute pain and will also speed the recovery process." One of the techniques that Dr. Mason teaches, called the Galbreath technique involves having the child lie down on his or her back. The parent places one hand on the chin, with thumb and forefinger resting along the lower jawbone. The other hand is placed on the forehead to hold the child's head in place. As the child opens his mouth, the parent gently moves the lower jaw to the side away from the ear that hurts and holds it there for three to five seconds before releasing the jaw. The parent then repeats this maneuver three times.</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">The auricular drainage technique also requires the child to lie on his or her back, with the parent on the side of the ear that does not hurt. The parent forms a "V" by separating her middle and ring fingers on the hand that is closer to the child's feet. Placing the ear that hurts in the base of this "V" the parent places his or her other hand on the opposite side of the child's head to provide support. The parent then gently but firmly massages the infected ear in a clockwise motion, then reverses direction, massaging the infected ear in a counter-clockwise direction. "Ear infections are one of the most common reasons for physician visits by young children," Dr. Mason said. "In a small pilot study at our school, we found that osteopathic manipulation, including the Galbreath and auricular drainage techniques, provided almost immediate relief from pain caused by a middle ear infection. If those results can be repeated in larger clinical studies, it could lead to new treatment standards that reduce the use of antibiotics, pain relievers and even surgery in children."</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">To request an interview with Dr. Mason, please contact Jerry Carey, UMDNJ News Service, at (856) 566-6171 or (973) 972-5000. The UMDNJ-School of Osteopathic Medicine (www.som.umdnj.edu) is dedicated to providing excellence in medical education, research and health care for New Jersey and the nation. An emphasis on primary health care and community health services reflects the school's osteopathic philosophy, with centers of excellence that demonstrate its commitment to developing clinically skillful, compassionate and culturally competent physicians from diverse backgrounds, who are prepared to become leaders in their communities. The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) is the nation's largest free-standing public health sciences university with more than 5,500 students attending the state's three medical schools, its only dental school, a graduate school of biomedical sciences, a school of health related professions, a school of nursing and its only school of public health, on five campuses. Last year, there were more than two million patient visits to UMDNJ facilities and faculty at campuses in Newark, New Brunswick/Piscataway, Scotch Plains, Camden and Stratford. UMDNJ operates University Hospital, a Level I Trauma Center in Newark, and University Behavioral HealthCare, a mental health and addiction services network. Every Clark school -- every inner city school, for that matter -- cries out for more parent involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">If only parents would come to the school and make the connections, then perhaps they could be persuaded to be "on the school's side" and get their children off to school on time, take an interest in homework, pressure their children to achieve, and attend school functions. These are worthy goals and reflect an understanding that among poor families, parent involvement must be defined in nontraditional terms. However, even a revised understanding of parent support from low-income families relies too much on efforts to get parents on the "school's side," not enough on what it takes to get the schools on the "parents' side." Efforts to involve low-income parents in urban middle schools must use a language and actions that convey a commitment by the schools to support parents and a message that the schools are family-centered. These two energetic parent coordinators set up parent centers at each school, started classes for parents, and served as mediators between families and teachers/administrators. Before the Empowerment Project, says Cubias, "parents weren't welcome in the schools." Now, they have their own places there, use newly acquired computer skills to publish their own newsletters that talk about school issues frankly, and volunteer for tasks that the parent coordinators try to make meaningful.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">With local funds beyond those supplied by the Clark Foundation, the Empowerment Project has expanded to two other middle schools and to the high schools where students from the four schools usually matriculate. Surveys show that parent satisfaction with the Clark network schools is up considerably. This becomes even more impressive when compared to a 1995 citywide study of black parents that found 47 percent convinced the schools in general had become worse in the past five years. Parent involvement and approval of "Kozy" and Parkman, however, weren't enough to make the differences needed. Even as parent satisfaction went up, indicators of student success at the schools went down-achievement in reading and math, as well as attendance. How can more involved parents approve of schools that are not serving their students well? On the surface, says Owens, "parents are concerned only about their own child's progress."</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">The numbers of parents brought into the schools through the Empowerment Project represent dramatic increases, percentage-wise, from previous years, but they still make up only a minority of parents at the two schools. Because of their involvement, their children probably are doing better in school, or the parents at least are in accord with the schools' goals. If the school-wide indicators stay the same, however, Owens predicts that a next stage may be anger. Underneath the parent involvement issue in inner-city schools is a deep mistrust by parents that schools hardly comprehend. What Kozy and Parkman accomplished was a change in parents' perceptions about the schools. Schools became more welcoming places, and thus in the minds of parents, better environments for their children. However, as Martine Makower of the Urban Strategies Council in Oakland points out, "parent involvement is not a substitute for teachers being professional and making sure students learn."</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">More parent involvement might minimize teacher behaviors rising from cultural misunderstandings, she says, and an informed community is better able to hold schools accountable. In Louisville, the excellent training and materials offered by the Effective Parenting Information for Children (EPIC) provided a base for teachers and parents on how to connect better. Yet, the number of parents drawn into the schools grew very little. At Western Middle School, where grandparents and parents of today's students hold their own memories of hostility and failure as students at the same school, luring parents back is tough. Western began a monthly awards program, the Falcon Awards, at which students nominate their parents for the honor and read their essays aloud at luncheon ceremonies for the families. These are heart-warming experiences -- tear-jerkers for many -- and they increased parent involvement to some extent. "Dealing with the love/hate relationship of parents with the school means that we have to work through what parent involvement means."</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">But reaching parents requires more. For Principal Mary Grace Jaeger, "dealing with the love/hate relationship of parents with the school means that we have to work through what parent involvement means." Parent attitudes are more important than involvement, she admits, but the dilemma is how to change attitudes on a scale beyond the few parents who respond to overtures by the school. This dilemma is borne out in a survey of parents at Western and Southern Middle Schools by the county-wide Coalition of Middle Schools. Parents talked about several barriers that are very real to them: "a discomfort with the confrontational setting" created by schools when communicating with parents; negative past personal experiences; an inability to do what teachers ask them to do; and a put-down attitude toward workshops, training, or other meetings between parents and school people. This mistrust makes seemingly innocent school practices take on different meaning for parents. Teachers, for example, may believe that a team conference is more helpful to parents than conferring with individual teachers, but to a parent facing a group of teachers at the same time, the experience could be formidable and more threatening.</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">In San Diego, diversity is the "parent problem." Throughout the Clark project, the Home/School Partnership Collaboration, coordinated by the June Burnett Institute at San Diego State University, brought together seven agencies in San Diego to create a multi-ethnic effort to increase parent involvement. It included the traditional parent groups (PTA, Junior League, Parent Institute), but also reached out to Chicano, Asian, and African-American groups. It sponsored parent training at different levels. When barrio parents at Muirlands Middle School protested what they perceived as discriminatory practices/attitudes by Muirlands teachers, the Partnership helped work out a compromise that extended barrio parent involvement and barrio student participation in school affairs. At Mann Middle School, the various parent groups work through a Parent Center that provides interpreters for teachers, classes for parents, and volunteer coordination. The Partnership helped work out a compromise that extended barrio parent involvement and barrio student participation in school affairs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">Originally, its institutes for parents were separated by language/ethnic group, with parents coming together only for plenary sessions. All parents now meet together, discussing the same issues with the help of translators. At one meeting, for example, the film "Victor," about an immigrant boy caught between the culture of his family and that of his American school, resonated among all of the parents, helping them to feel a kinship with each other. "Parents from very different backgrounds find they share the same problems," says Jean Taylor, the PTA representative on the Partnership. While the Partnership has brought together cross-cultural leadership among various groups and increased the number of parents coming into the schools, the percentages of increased involvement are still not large. However, incidences of the lack of understanding are more likely to be with individual teachers, not a whole school, says Tomi Onibuwe-Johnson, project coordinator; and parents know the Partnership will step in and help. BALTIMORE: PARENTS GET HOMEWORK</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">In Baltimore, the Fund for Educational Excellence sponsored the Teachers Involving Parents in Schoolwork (TIPS) project, funded by the Clark Foundation. The assignments are for parents (or some other adult at home) and students to do together. Widely publicized at meetings and other parent contacts, the project undoubtedly increased parent knowledge of schoolwork and stimulated teachers to think of academic content from the parents' viewpoint. Nor did the program significantly increase parent involvement at either of the Clark schools in Baltimore. Looking through the parent involvement policies and summaries presented by the different Clark sites, one gets the impression that at least in the language used, the schools still perceive themselves as the leader, parents as the follower. Despite rhetoric about forming partnerships with parents, schools do not seem to have gone the extra step to become family-centered. For example, the Committee for Parent Empowerment of the Coalition on Middle Schools in Louisville wants parents to be advocates for their children, and parents and schools to develop mutual respect.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">Yet, the wording of the goal was less inviting: "All parents have the responsibility to be involved at high levels to enhance their children's opportunities for academic success." A parent might read that as an ultimatum, not an invitation. Being sensitive to the power images conveyed by language doesn't mean ignoring the responsibilities of parents. Schools should expect parents to expect a level of effort and stick-to-itness, as well as civility, of their children. Poor parents should "own" the determination that their their children prepare for higher education as much as do more affluent parents. "Without their help in deaccelerating parent anger," says Jeager, "this school might be out of control." As a demonstration site in Oakland, King Estates Junior High School chose from several models to use the Comer model of developing a team approach to student support and including parents on the team.</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">Roosevelt Junior High School in Oakland expanded its counseling services in order to provide individual and group counseling to both students and parents. Schools that help parents make connections, maneuver systems, and learn new skills are, in effect, helping their students also. Despite many efforts to reach parents, none of the original Clark schools has been able to become a truly family-centered school, one in which parents are as much a part of the school's mission as are students. Washington invited in, on campus, a city-sponsored parent center, a Head Start program, and a police neighborhood center. It helped establish a community center across the street from the school where students and adults receive a variety of services and which is credited with revitalizing what had been considered the most troubled neighborhood in Long Beach. Counselors at Washington have been relieved of most paperwork, using college interns for routine tasks; instead, the counselors focus on direct services to students and parents. Parents still do not come out to meetings like the school wants, according to the principal, but they are in the school constantly for different reasons and the school is earning a reputation as a place that cares about families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">However, there are hints among the schools in these blighted neighborhoods that they realize it is right for them to see parents as more than adjuncts to their goals. Instead of trying to get parents on their side, they are beginning to line up on the parents' side. Be sure to ask questions about homework, and set up a quiet place for your child to work. 3) Read everything that is sent home from school-report cards, homework assignments, school lunch plans, and vacation and bus schedules. By getting involved with your child's homework, communication between you and the school improves. Research shows that if a child is having difficulty with homework, parents should pay close attention. Talk to your child's teachers to find out what you can do to help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">Students from families with above-median parental involvement showed success rates 30% higher than those from families with below-median parental involvement, as measured by GPAs; test scores in math, science, reading, and social studies; and promotion, retention and teacher ratings. Home learning activities such as reading aloud and frequent open family discussions, are associated with improved student achievement. Parent/family involvement at home has a more significant impact on children than parent/family involvement in school activities. TIP: think about what you are doing -- and what more you can do -- to help your child with learning at home. Effective programs assist parents in learning how to create a home environment that fosters learning and how to provide support and encouragement for their children's success. TIP:   Ask about your school's programs to promote parental involvement. I want to know more about the curriculum and what I can do at home to support his learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="220">To provide support and assistance to the school To raise money to provide important resources for the students, teachers, and classrooms To provide fellowship and friendship among CCDS families Track and field equipment The diverse cultures, languages, knowledge, and insights of people of color contribute to creating inclusive and affirming institutions, and POCIS is a forum that promotes dialogue among African American, Latino/Hispanic, Asian/Asian American, Native American, Middle Eastern, Pacific Islander, European American, and multiracial colleagues who support this mission.

The school recognised that parents may have difficulty in understanding some of the work their children are studying, particularly as the level of study rises. Parents are therefore provided with: information on the curriculum content, for example, through subject guides which explain the topics their children will study each term; detailed overviews of each course offered when children select their courses; an opportunity to discuss future careers and courses with their child, teachers and specialist staff; and information on important Assignments and Investigations in each course, published in the Student Planner.</paragraph><paragraph parID="228">Letters are sent home to parents of those pupils who fail to meet the completion dates.

Approaches to impoving attendance included: monitoring and reward structures; informing parents of improvements in attendance through regular updates; involving children in discussing attendance at school assemblies and awards ceremonies; involving staff in setting a positive tone and in absence monitoring procedures; awards from local businesses to children who achieved 100% attendance throughout the academic year;</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">initiating a Joint Assessment Team and Home-School visiting arrangements; and involving the Attendance Council and Reporter to Children's Panel only when all other steps for improving a pupil's attendance had failed. The school found that through setting a clear, shared objective, and by working in partnership where everyone involved understood their role, significant improvements could be made in raising the level of attendance in a large primary school. A range of strategies are in place for involving parents. Initial Steps - Getting Parents Involved Learning support staff, guidance staff and subject staff visit the associated primary schools (at regular intervals throughout the session) to obtain information on individual pupils, including their strengths and areas of difficulty. Each year, a promotional video is made of Dalziel High School and given to all primary pupils who will be transferring to the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="234">Families can then watch the video and learn more about the school, how it will build on the child's experiences at primary school and what new experiences can be expected. Every parent is invited to a meeting in June, at which: a brief talk is given by the headteacher on the opportunities to become involved in their child's education and the expectations of the partnership between the school and the home; they tour the school and - meet their child's teachers - see examples of the work that s/he will be doing; and information leaflets are distributed on matters such as attendance and homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="235">The parents of hearing impaired pupils, and also those with specific learning difficulties, discuss individually with specialist staff how the parents can help in the education of their child. Building the partnership Homework must be marked up in the planner as it is given. The Planner is checked every week by staff at school. their son/daughter is regularly completing homework; and that they are happy with the amount of homework given. Parents are also encouraged to check the homework and tasks in other exercise books to ensure that aspects such as handwriting and neatness are of a suitably high standard.</paragraph><paragraph parID="236">They are encouraged to contact the school if they have any questions or concerns about homework or any other matters. A monthly newsletter is sent to all parents informing them of news items and important events, such as parents' evenings or examinations. This case study highlights the ways in which two Scottish schools involve parents effectively in their children's learning. In Scotland, pupils can opt to leave school when aged 16, though most go on to study further at school or college. The case studies, therefore, cover the involvement of parents with children across the ages of compulsory education in Scotland.

Through this partnership, the school has developed a very wide range of initiatives to involve parents directly in supporting their children. All parents of primary pupils involved in class visits and a shared reading programme The involvement of parents was identified as one of the key elements in a successful school where all pupils achieve their maximum potential. Every parent is issued with a school handbook which sets out and encourages involvement in many aspects, and at each stage, of their children's learning. Their parents are informed and are invited to visit the school to have the strategies explained and to find out what they can do at home to complement the work of the school. From the very early stages of first year, the school establishes very clear communications with parents to encourage partnership.</paragraph><paragraph parID="238">Parents are closely involved in any decisions to offer additional support to their child. The timing of reports and Parents' Evenings are organised so that there is regular contact between the school and home for every pupil throughout his or her school life. Helping parents - with no knowledge of, or ability in, subjects to become involved in children's learning If your child is having trouble keeping it together through all the stress of December, try taking some time to help her learn simple relaxation techniques. For a start, even a few minutes of sitting quietly or throwing a ball around outside with you can relieve tension that builds around studying for tests and writing papers. You might also try simple breathing techniques, like these outlined below. Sit in a quiet place away from phones, school work, music, computers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="239">Notice your breath; hear your breath. Put your hand on your belly and notice how breathing makes your belly move. Do this for just a minute or two and see if it helps remove the clutter of the day from your child's mind. Now breath in to the count of three and breath out to the count of three. Parents who volunteer at Country Day not only support the school and meet fellow parents and their families, but they also learn more about the ongoing educational process.

Show your children that school is important to you so that it will be important to them. Help your children, especially teens, manage time. Make a chart showing when chores need to be done and when assignments are due. Volunteer. Build a sense of community and caring by giving your time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="242">Choose projects in which children and teens can take part, too. When homework time comes, establish a specific time and place for doing it. Include the child in establishing the time. (See Figure 4.5) Find a place where the student can easily access any resource materials or get parental assistance if needed. Help your student develop a system for organizing materials, assignments, worksheets, etc. Periodically check the system to make certain it still provides a logical framework for the child. Check homework for completion and accuracy to your best ability.</paragraph><paragraph parID="243">Ask questions! NOTE: Check with your child's teacher. Some teachers want to see the mistakes a student makes on homework so they know what the student is learning and what they are struggling with. Assist your child with studying for tests by reviewing text information. Create a homework contract, an agreement regarding homework responsibilities, with your child. It can save a parent from one of those nasty battles referred to earlier.

Agree together on a regular time and place for homework. Try to schedule homework time for when you or your child's caregiver can supervise. Make sure your son or daughter understands the assignment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="245">Sign and date your young children's homework. Teachers appreciate it when they know that the parents are interested enough to check over their children's homework and see that it is finished. Follow up on homework assignments by asking to see your children's homework after it has been returned by the teacher. Look at the teacher's comments to see if your children have done the assignments correctly. Discuss teachers' homework expectations during teacher-parent conferences. Don't do your children's homework. Make sure they understand that homework is their responsibility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="246">Be sure to praise your children for a job well done. Encourage the good work that your children do and comment about improvements they have made. Teachers can help parents win the homework battle too. Being an ally with the parents and supporting them in their efforts is immeasurably important for success in this area. How involved the teacher decides to be may vary a great deal. Some of the following suggestions require very little time or energy on the part of the teacher. Others hint of a whole new way of looking at homework and what its purpose should be.</paragraph><paragraph parID="247">Initiate a "Homework Hotline" that parents and students can access to get homework assignments, test dates and other important information. Remember to carry the information in multiple languages to suit the school's population. Provide parents with suggestions on how to help with homework. If a child has special needs, homework may be a particularly stressful time. Information on how to work with their child is invaluable to many parents who struggle to understand their child's learning style. * Provide parents with a homework chart similar to those used by Perry Local Schools in Massillon, Ohio. Have parents sign the sheet and allow space for any comments or questions they might have.</paragraph><paragraph parID="248">Not all parents know what constitutes good study habits. Providing them with some guidelines to review with their child can give them the insight they need to help their child develop good study habits. Interactive homework--where the students must involve a parent or other adult to complete the assignment--is gaining in popularity. It can be used at all levels of education and usually includes communication from the parent as to how the student did with the project. You can learn many things from children. How much patience you have for instance. Often the student needs to explain the project and share information with their families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="249">The TIPS process (Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork) is one example of interactive homework. This innovative approach to homework was developed with the help of teachers at Johns Hopkins University. For more information on TIPS materials, refer to Appendix C. Provide parents with suggestions for in-home resource libraries. What type of reference books will the student in your class need? Suggest computer software to parents who have a home computer. For those who do not, perhaps arrangements could be made to allow access to the school's computer lab after regular school hours or on weekends.</paragraph><paragraph parID="250">Note: For many parents, it may be beneficial to provide some computer education opportunities. There are still a large number of parents who are not computer literate even if they have a computer at home. Parents--The Key To Success When parents make an effort to be involved with their child's school work, the child realizes that education is important to the parent. A life-long love of learning can emerge through the support of a parent. Children tend to work harder at their studies when parents are involved. Parents should set high standards for their children and encourage them to work hard to reach their full potential.</paragraph><paragraph parID="251">As a child advances to secondary education, parents need to encourage their child to enroll in courses that challenge him/ her. They should discuss career paths and opportunities. It is important to continue to be as involved as possible in all aspects of their child's education. Above all, parents should always believe that their child can learn and that they, as parents, have an important role to play in that learning. Benefits when parents can better help their children learn at home: For Students: improved communication with parents</paragraph><paragraph parID="252">higher achievement more motivation and commitment to school studies better relations with school and children higher self-esteem more self-confidence heightened awareness of children's education better communication with parents</paragraph><paragraph parID="253">stronger school support Do we provide information to families on how to monitor and discuss schoolwork at home? Do we provide information on how to assist students with skills that they need to improve? Do we have a regular schedule of interactive homework that requires students to demonstrate and discuss what they are learning with a family member? Do we ask parents to listen to their child read or read aloud to their child? Do we provide calendars with daily or weekly activities for families to do at home and in the community? Do we assist families in helping students set their academic goals, select courses, and plan for college work?</paragraph><paragraph parID="254">Key points to remember: Good communication and a teacher-parent "team" philosophy are the foundation of successful parent involvement at home. Make homework fun! The more specific learning suggestions and other information are to the individual student, the more likely they are to be used. No one idea to gain parent involvement with learning at home will be successful with all parents. Stay flexible, continue to offer suggestions and let the parents know that you believe their involvement and support are important. Help parents identify specific goals that can be worked on at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="255">Offer suggestions to the parents for creating their own "kits" that might help develop skills needed to achieve these goals. Never assume the parent will not work with their child at home. Some will need more guidance than others. Try to provide text books or contents of texts (perhaps on cassette tape) that are currently being studied. This is particularly helpful for a student who is having difficulty with a particular lesson or for a student who simply needs more exposure to a lesson. All students, teachers and parents deserve a break sometime! When working with parents of a student with special challenges, give advance notice of special projects, field trips, etc.</paragraph><paragraph parID="256">This will allow the parent the opportunity to discuss the upcoming event or project with their child as a preparation. more support from parents in educational decisions For Parents: Do we provide information to families on required skills in all subjects? Showing parents how to create a home environment that supports their child as a student is a good place to start. Development of positive personal qualities, habits, beliefs, values, taught by the family. Understanding and confidence about parenting, child and adolescent development, and changes in home conditions for learning as children proceed through school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="257">Parents of students with identified learning needs should be included in parenting workshops, videos and other communications. Offer childcare for all children and schedule events early enough for younger children to meet bedtimes. Parent input is a great resource to ensure that topics are relevant and timely for parent needs. Figure 1.2, Developing the Courage to be Imperfect, from STEP Systematic Training for Effective Parenting by Don Dinkmeyer, Sr. and Gary D. McKay "Communication is the most important skill in life," according to Stephen R. Covey, author of the bestseller, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (1989 p. 237)." This kind of collaborative relationship is the foundation of planning and preparing for changes and improvements in education. This collaboration necessitates the meaningful involvement of parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="258">A systematic plan for communication is the basis for collaboration. The plan should be meaningful, effective, and specific, rather than haphazard and sporadic. It should be dynamic, ongoing, and reflective of the collaborative relationship. The style and climate are different for each school, and the communication plan will reflect this. A useful guide for home-school communication will be comprehensive yet flexible. A commonality of purpose and expectations between school and home motivates a child. In those instances where the family has succeeded in meeting the child's needs within the family context, parents can share information and attitudes about the child with the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="259">They must work with local political leaders to raise school budgets to pay teachers for performance (merit pay) and with school administrators to see that funds are used to promote effective classes in the core subjects. Above all, they must make certain that their own children understand the importance of a good education and have the support required for the difficult job of learning. In addition to report cards and notes from teachers, a frequently used method of communicating with parents is the school newsletter. Besides informing the reader of school special events and programs, include tips from teachers and other parents. Remind readers of the many options available to them for involvement with the school. Although this communication may seem one-way, recognize that parental involvement will change from year to year as lives and responsibilities change. Even parents who may not participate appreciate being informed about school matters.</paragraph><paragraph parID="260">To increase readership, some schools send home classroom and school newsletters on an alternating basis. Offer translations of the newsletter to parents who are in the process of learning English. They have designed an activity to reward "Exceptional Excuses." Parents could find this activity valuable when dealing with the excuses children present when they fail to perform a required activity. Children with identified learning needs related to Attention Deficit Disorder frequently have difficulty following directions: they seem to rely on excuses. Humor can reduce the feelings of inadequacy that accompany nonperformance. Too often, we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve!</paragraph><paragraph parID="261">Some other responsibility building suggestions include: Use a simple cardboard box to help a child be responsible for school belongings. When he/she comes home from school, all belongings should be placed in the box. When homework is completed, it goes in the box. The box is the last stop before the child heads out the door in the morning. Give a child responsibility for growing a small plant. The positive and negative results of carrying out responsibilities will be very clear.</paragraph><paragraph parID="262">* The "Parents as Partners " committee from West Elementary School in Celina, Ohio held a workshop entitled "Let's Get Organized--On the Right Track" for parents of elementary school children. The workshop was presented in the fall of the school year. b) Discipline children without force. c) Reduce stress in your life. d) Learn new communication skills. e) Perform infant CPR and infant massage. f) Develop ways to stimulate your child's intellectual and emotional growth.</paragraph><paragraph parID="263">g) Find ways to catch children being good. h) Identify effective time-out strategies. i) Train children to comply with parental requests. j) Reduce or eliminate difficulties with tasks assigned for home completion. k) Set up intervention plans for home. Flyers were sent home with students, distributed through local agencies and advertised via press releases. In addition to offering free child care, the parents received $10 for "gas money" after each session.</paragraph><paragraph parID="264">Grade-level Workshops and Technology In addition to general parenting workshops and training opportunities, Epstein challenges schools to provide parents with grade-level parenting information. She asks schools to use technological resources as part of that training. Schools are in a position to help parents develop parenting skills that are needed at different stages of a child's development. This is more easily accomplished by providing parent training on grade-level/age-appropriate topics. It is important to mention parent training that includes parents of children with identified learning needs. These identified learning needs may be academic or social, or both.</paragraph><paragraph parID="265">Schools should be sure workshop presenters and trainers collaborate with special educators so that workshop materials include all students. Special educators and regular educators could work together to develop a range of grade-specific parenting concepts that include enrichment activities and remedial activities. Parents can create opportunities for their children to develop responsibility as part of their daily routine. Child development classes addressed infants through school-age, with workshop topics that included: a) Know what to expect from children at different ages. Schools need to keep parents involved so they will better understand the importance of their role in the educational process. Using an age-level, grade-level and ability-level focus, the suggestions listed below will enhance basic parenting skills and utilize school technologies. Hold regular parent meetings where parents can ask questions and discuss age-specific, grade-specific and ability-specific issues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="266">Instead of music, or other "fillers," have hold-lines on school telephones list creative discipline ideas. Develop a list of discipline strategies and distribute to classroom parents. * St. Bernard Elementary and Elmwood Place Elementary, near Cincinnati, Ohio, have minimal bus transportation. The school takes the opportunity to show videos about how children learn. They provide coffee and donuts and schedule the workshop during the school day while their children are occupied. -Family relations; communication, interpersonal relations and sibling rivalry. -Social problems; drugs and alcohol, violence, smoking, stress, and living with change.</paragraph><paragraph parID="267">Work with local Regional Resource Centers and community colleges to determine if continuing education credits could apply for school-sponsored parent workshops. Help all families establish home environments to support children as students. The single most significant factor in predicting whether a child will be successful in his or her educational process is the level of involvement of his or her parents in that process. According to the National PTA, the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning, the Parent Institute, and the US Department of Education, research shows that when parents play a positive role in their child's education, their child does better in school. Children whose parents are involved in their education are more motivated to learn. Motivated students tend to be more involved in class, more concerned about homework, and more successful academically. A common problem, as indicated on parent surveys, is that parents often don't feel they know what they can do to create the environment that supports their children as students.</paragraph><paragraph parID="268">This section, entitled PARENTING, is designed to identify and describe concrete examples that schools can implement to help all parents establish home environments that support all children as students. Following the framework of Dr. Joyce Epstein, schools can help parents develop better parenting skills by: 1) Providing suggestions and ideas for home conditions that support learning. 2) Providing grade level opportunities for parents to learn about parenting and child-rearing through workshops, videotapes and computerized phone messages. 3) Providing parent education and other courses or training for parents (e. g., GED, college credit, family literacy). 4) Directing families to support programs for health, nutrition and other services. 5) Conducting home visits at transition points to preschool, elementary, middle and high school. 6) Initiating neighborhood meetings to help families understand schools and to help schools understand families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="269">These six areas will be addressed in more detail below. An asterix* indicates authentic examples of what parents, schools and communities are presently doing in a particular area. Schools can help parents establish home conditions that support learning. The suggestions and ideas listed below are provided, with permission, from The Parent Institute's, Forty-Four Proven Ideas Parents Can Use to Help Their Children Do Better in School (1995). Not all forty-four of the proven ideas are listed here. Those that apply more directly to what parents can do in establishing a student-centered home environment, have been selected. Time is a critical factor when it comes to parenting.</paragraph><paragraph parID="270">Today's busy parents need to schedule time for their children and to make the most of the time they have. Schools could suggest the following as strategies to help parents make time count. Plan to eat certain meals together as a family. Mark specific times on the calendar each week when parents will spend time with their children. During that time, parents will focus love and attention on their children. Use "car time" to talk with children. No one can get up and leave.</paragraph><paragraph parID="271">Look for things to do together as a family: Get children involved in choosing how to spend "together time." A home environment that supports children as students will build their self-esteem. Schools can teach parents activities that build self-esteem in their children. Some activities could include: Look for ways to tell children what is likable about them, and that they are loved. No age limit applies to this one Praise children often and let children overhear parents praising them to others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="272">Development and publication of this document was made possible through Grant #92-1/97 which was funded under P.L. 104-183 in accordance with goals established by the Ohio Developmental Disabilities Planning Council and administered by the Ohio Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. Parents are a key component in the field of education, from shared responsibilities for decisionmaking for their individual child's education, health and well-being, to parent participation in organizations that address community-based needs for all children. 3313.472, effective July 1, 1992, requires that each Board of Education, located in the state of Ohio, adopts a policy to provide parents an opportunity to be "actively involved in their children's education." The law also states that parents must be informed of: a) the importance of parental involvement in directly affecting the success of their children's educational efforts; b) how and when to assist their children in and support their children's classroom learning activities; c) techniques, strategies and skills to use at home to improve their children's development as future responsible adult members of society. As part of the project's commitment to having parents involved in the education process, this "parent handbook" has been commissioned. Parent Involvement: Strategies for Success is intended to assist schools in their attempts to create opportunities for meaningful parent involvement in the education of all children. Unfortunately, the formal education process often does not reinforce a sense of belonging for the parents of these children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="273">While this lack of "parental belonging" creates a diminished educational environment for all children, it can be devastating for children with identified learning needs (typically referred to as "disabilities"). This work is a response to those who have indicated that they need more information about how to involve parents in their children's education. Acknowledging that meaningful parent involvement is not a "one-size fits all" exercise, this work offers a variety of examples and suggestions that have been successfully used by diverse groups across the state of Ohio. Research demonstrates that parent involvement improves student achievement, attitudes, homework, report card grades and aspirations according to Dr. Joyce Epstein (1995), from the Johns Hopkins University, Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning. Each of the sections is followed by a brief description of the "benefits" (Epstein calls them "results") that students, parents and teachers typically experience when schools successfully implement strategies to involve parents in the educational process. Figures are referred to throughout the text and indicate authentic examples that demonstrate an idea or strategy discussed in a particular section - if the "figures" are images, they do not appear in this text only version. "The Laughing Classroom," by Diane Loomans and Karen Kolberg (1993, p. 172), identifies fifty creative ways to praise a child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="274">"A Book About Me" is a great way to help a child see himself/ herself as "somebody." Help children discover their roots by talking with family members during holiday and other visits. Help children learn from their problems. Parents should avoid words like "failure" and focus on what can be learned from experiences that don't work out as planned. Parents can contribute to a child's sense of competence in many ways. Schools can help by providing parents with information about competence-building. This information could include suggestions such as:</paragraph><paragraph parID="275">Children need the 4 "A's": Attention, Appreciation, Affection and Acceptance, as well as the 3 "R's. Believe every child is gifted. Helping a child see his/her giftedness is very motivating. Encourage children to read biographies about very successful people. Learning about traits that made others successful can motivate imitation. Knowledge and use of local resources by family and child to increase skills, talents or obtain needed services. Family pride in and contributions to community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="276">Interactions with other families in community activities. Awareness of school's role in the community, and community support and contributions to the school. We send home folders of student work weekly and monthly for parent review and comments. We have a homework hotline for students and families to hear daily assignments and messages. We conduct an annual survey for families to share information and concerns about students' needs and reactions to school programs. We encourage families and the community to be involved at school by: At which grades? K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 - assisting in the classroom (e. g., tutoring, grading papers, etc.) At which grades?</paragraph><paragraph parID="277">Involvement in Academic Activities Involve families with their children in homework and other curriculum-related activities and decisions We provide information to families on required skills in all subjects. We provide information to families on how to monitor and discuss schoolwork at home. We provide information on how to assist students with skills that they need to improve. We have a regular schedule of interactive homework that requires students to demonstrate and discuss what they are learning with a family member. We ask parents to listen to their child read or read aloud to their child. We help families help students set academic goals, select courses, and plan for college or work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="278">Include families as participants in school decisions, and develop parent leaders and representatives Be sure parents understand concepts being taught to their children. Offer opportunities for parents to familiarize themselves with classroom materials and discuss grade-level curriculum. Avoid experiences that can damage self-esteem. Schools need to be mindful of these experiences when developing courses and training sessions for parents. Since a typical, non-threatening place for most parents would be in their own homes, it seems logical, in many cases, to make home visits to address the factors related to transitions. Home visits are useful tools for gathering information about the student and the family as partners in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="279">Parents should let the students know that they are expected to do well in their new school situation. Parents should introduce themselves to the school principal at the first opportunity rather than waiting for a problem to arise. The school representatives making home visits should provide some suggestions as to how that meeting could occur. Parents should stay in touch with school counselors. Counselors are usually the school contact when problems develop. Parents should encourage their children to stay in touch with counselors too. Parents should know how to access information on school policies and curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="280">They should know that they have the right to examine their child's records. This can be very important for reviewing information that passes on with the child at transition points. Parents should be informed about parent-teacher conferences and other meetings that may be scheduled. Home visits can alert school personnel to any communication needs that parents may have (e. g. not English speaking, transportation problems, etc.). Make sure the home visit reinforces the family members' appreciation of their role as partners in the educational process. That means asking for and valuing input. Help parents educate their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="281">School workshops and training sessions need to reflect the life-lessons adult learners bring to educational settings. Workshops should provide activities that emphasize "What I Do Well" and identify talents and abilities of the parent participants. * Washington Local Schools' Student Services Department invited the chairperson of the Special Education Department of the University of Toledo to present an in-service on Increasing Self-Advocacy. The in-service was intended for, and open to, special and general educators, administrators and parents. While a critical topic for parents of students with identified learning needs, it was a relevant topic for all parents. Sharing in-service resources with parents capitalizes on the costs of offering in-service programs. Teachers, administrators and parents were educated regarding the use of technology as a learning tool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="282">Parents had an opportunity to familiarize themselves with state-of-the-art computer programs, while increasing their understanding of ways they can establish a home environment that more effectively supports their child as a student. By opening a workshop to parents of all students, more parents could benefit from computer training. Nancy Berla (1992), Director of the Help Line and ACCESS Clearinghouse of the National Committee for Citizens in Education, cites research indicating that parent involvement in a child's education during the middle years (ages 10 -14) is as important a factor in every child's success at school as it is in earlier years. Parent involvement may be more difficult, due to the middle school structure. In middle school, each student has five or six teachers and each teacher has as many as 150 students. Student independence is another issue that affects parent involvement in middle and high schools. Adolescence is a time when all students are moving toward independence from their parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="283">Transitions to middle school, and especially high school, need to emphasize a greater degree of independence on the part of the student. At the same time, middle schools and high schools need to maintain the value of parent involvement. Learning begins at home. A recent "Principal" study, cited by researcher Joyce Epstein (1995) at Johns Hopkins University, says that American mothers and fathers spend very little time talking or reading to their children. Helping parents to understand the role of "educator at home" may be a good place to start. So academically speaking, the parent becomes a support person. The role is to reinforce or enhance what is being initiated in the classroom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="284">Poor communication between the school and the parent can rob a student of the support he needs to be successful. Families need to know how to help at home. How can schools begin? Teachers can provide helpful information to parents in a variety of ways. Welcoming letters to parents of kindergarten students can include activities for parents to do with their child at home to prepare them for school. Information can be very specific and tailor-made to an individual student or class. As a rule, the more specific the information is to the student, the more likely it is to be used.</paragraph><paragraph parID="285">* Parents should be made aware of the many experiences their children can learn from quite naturally. Setting the Stage Parents are partners in their child's success at school and in life. Children with concerned parents learn more quickly, enjoy school more and achieve more than children who lack that support and care. Every school has its "hard to reach" parents. Often they are the parents of students who could benefit from the support and involvement of their parents the most. Creative techniques have been used by many schools in order to assist as many parents as possible.</paragraph><paragraph parID="286">The following are some that have had great success. Many different types of learning activities can be placed into a "kit." These kits may contain simple learning games, videos, easy science or math activities or reading materials. Easy to read instructions or suggestions for how to use the materials are included in the kit. Clever names such as "Super Science," "Shoebox Science," and "Math Made at Home" lend the activities an air of fun rather than seeming like homework. The key is that they are projects that involve the student and the parent. Host a specific grade-level-only family night to expose parents to the curriculum for that grade or to provide suggestions to parents to help them reinforce skills related to proficiency testing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="287">Formal student-parent workshops can be held. Topics including study skills and test taking, time management, organizational skills and understanding different learning styles are especially effective when presented to the student and the parent. Encourage discussion of the impact these skills may have on homework time. A presentation on "Good, Bad and Ugly" television programs can be particularly relevant. Many also need to be reminded of the drawbacks to excessive television viewing--lack of exercise, reading practice, play and study time. Fun, informal activities held in a community setting may interest parents who typically are hesitant to attend school functions. This is especially true if the parent's own school experiences were less than ideal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="288">Try a new twist to encourage students to remind mom and dad to attend. "No Homework Passes" get the attention of most students. Those students may also show more interest in what their parents learned at the meeting if a few written comments from the parent are part of getting the pass. Make the session topic something the parents need to know but also something the student can relate to. For example, most parents know they should read with their children at home. Help parents expand on that premise by encouraging them to talk with their child about the pictures, discuss the plot, identify the main characters or question the motives of a certain character's actions. It can never hurt to simply send suggestions home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="289">This can be done as a few comments on a weekly class newsletter, handed to a parent during conferences or sent home with the students as part of the school newsletter. The idea is to involve parents in educational activities with their children. Events such as "Read-Ins," family puppet shows, community tree plantings, and a district-wide road rally scavenger hunt have been successful. These programs may include a speaker or several brief sessions on different topics of interest. If a speaker is included, remember to offer child care and have activities for the children. The focus should remain on interactive activities for parents and children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="290">"Make-it / Take-it" games and activities are ideal. These are easy to assemble projects that parents can do with their child. Once the project is complete, it can be taken home and used by the family. In addition to the materials, the parents had the opportunity to meet and "network" with each other. Then the school sent home "reading packets" that included a copy of the book with questions for parents to discuss with their child. The packet also included a couple of books on areas of interest generated by the original book. Packets are circulated throughout the student population on a rotating basis.</paragraph><paragraph parID="291">The program is very well received and establishes guidelines for parents to help their children learn at home. Homework-Help or Headache? It is the subject of many family arguments and unfortunately some parents eventually decide it is an argument not worth pursuing. They are right ... and wrong! Parents need to be involved in their student's homework but it should not be a source of tension or ill feelings. Parent involvement in school work increases student academic success and builds self-esteem. Parents can minimize and even prevent the hassles over homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="292">It is not as difficult as one might think. Parents need to establish some basic rules and routines for their children and the earlier they start, the better. Turn off the television during homework time. Parents should not expect their child to focus on math if the rest of the family is laughing and enjoying a favorite sit-com in the next room. Keep in mind that children are in school a long time--let them play, watch television or a video, talk with friends and relax. This is especially true for young children but all ages can benefit from a little time for unorganized activities. Learning Begins at Home</paragraph><paragraph parID="293">Parents can set the stage for learning in everyday activities at home. Here's how: Set a good example by reading. Read to your children, even after they can read independently. Set aside a family reading time. Take turns reading aloud to each other. Take your children to the library regularly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="294">Let them see you checking out books for yourself, too. Build math reasoning skills together. Have young children help sort laundry, measure ingredients for a recipe or keep track of rainfall for watering the lawn. Involve teens in research and planning for a family vacation or a household project, such as planting a garden or repainting a room. Regulate the amount and content of the television your family watches. Read the weekly TV listing together and plan shows to watch. Encourage discussions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="295">Play family games. Show good sportsmanship. Expand on the above idea by including a list or brochure of community resources that are related in some way to the activity. This may be a helpful resource to parents. If the school has a lending library, include a current listing of available materials. Also, for students who are struggling, try to create goal-related activities and reference materials for the parents. Parents and students alike need to be aware of the benefits of educational channels and school access programming.</paragraph><paragraph parID="296">Many schools offer parent workshops but often they are not well attended. "I hate homework!" Many students have said it. Many parents have thought it. Whitten, P. and Rice, J. (1996) "Parents and Schools Working Together for Students' Success." We lend families books or tapes on parenting or videotapes of parent workshops. Conduct effective communications from school to home and from home to school about school programs and children's progress.</paragraph><paragraph parID="297">We have formal conferences with every parent at least once a year. K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 - A calendar of school events. K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 - Student activity information. K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 - Curriculum and program information. K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 - Ideas to help with homework. K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 - School volunteer information. K 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 - Samples of student writing and artwork.</paragraph><paragraph parID="298">Provide parents with a preview of coming topics and assignments so that they can help their children be ready for that learning or activity. Returned and signed by the parents, the samples provide accurate communication about the child's progress and upon review make preparation for conferences and report cards easier for the teacher. Parents receive a complete list of all the material so that they know what selections await them. Inform parents in advance that this service is available to them. Parents come to learn what computer programs students use in the classroom and how they can help to follow up or individualize the activity at home. Do we have a homework hotline for students and families to hear daily assignments and messages? Parents have an ethical and legal right to be informed and to participate in their child's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="299">Establish a spirit of open communication by inviting parents into the school for visits and meetings. Parental insights into children's needs, especially when those children have special identified needs, are invaluable to help children maximize learning. Parents need to know that the schools find them important and that they have valuable and necessary contributions to make towards the education of all children. Some suggestions to help create a welcoming atmosphere are: Parents should be made aware early in the school year of the many options for volunteering available to them. Some schools have a sign up sheet at an open house or at kindergarten registration where parents can sign up for activities that will take place throughout the school year. This allows parents the opportunity to plan ahead and adjust busy schedules as necessary.</paragraph><paragraph parID="300">Parents also gain firsthand appreciation of the many demands placed on teachers in a typical school day. Some examples of opportunities for volunteering in the classroom are: Invite the parent of a child with special needs to come into their child's class and share insights and answer classmates' questions about the child. Some parents have the desire to make a difference in their child's education by volunteering in ways that impact building or district policies. Parents can no longer abdicate their responsibilities by not playing an active role in the life of the school community. Observe ways in which teachers work with their child and learn successful techniques Appreciate and understand responsibilities of teachers and other school personnel</paragraph><paragraph parID="301">Increase self confidence Gain understanding of own child by seeing them in relationship to and with peers Learn skills that could apply to a job such as punctuality, dependability, filing, or operating office equipment Prepare science materials Review text books Cut out laminated materials Send in cookies, treats, etc. for parties</paragraph><paragraph parID="302">Make phone calls through a telephone "tree" network Assemble handouts, packets, etc. Plan and arrange field trips. Some parents are hesitant to come into the school building, tentative in their role, or unsure of their skills and how they might be able to help. Working on classroom projects at home is a good way to engage these parents. For some volunteers this may be the most they will be able to offer the schools. For others, however, if they gain confidence in these activities, it could lead to a more direct participation in their child's classroom or the school building at large.</paragraph><paragraph parID="303">In The Classroom Oftentimes parents are invited to visit the school by the teacher only as a result of something their child has done that the teacher would like to see changed. Arranging for parents to volunteer in the classroom can help create a more positive relationship. Then, when issues do need to be discussed with parents, meetings can be conducted in a climate of mutual respect and understanding. The identified child might or might not be present, depending on the appropriateness. This type of activity can help make teachers and students more comfortable with diversity and help make the child and family feel more a part of the school community. Volunteers can work one-on-one with a child to review academic skills, reinforce concepts already taught by the classroom teacher or present materials using a different approach.</paragraph><paragraph parID="304">* At Mason Heights Elementary, in Mason, Ohio, "The Bucket Brigade" has been created for volunteers to use in one-on-one learning opportunities. (See Figure 3.4) In this program the classroom teacher has a schedule posted stating the child's name and what area needs to be worked on between the volunteer and student. A "bucket" of materials is then utilized to address the individual needs of the student. A classroom teacher can invite parents into the classroom to share their knowledge on a hobby they have, their career, or a trip of special interest. This activity can be a good way to involve fathers and working mothers who may have limited time to give to the school. Volunteers can be involved in a variety of reading activities. They can read material to students for whom the content is appropriate but the reading level is too difficult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="305">Stories can be read to small groups of children or to the class as a whole. Students can practice their reading skills by reading to a volunteer. Using a teacher-developed checklist as a guide, volunteers can reinforce math, spelling and/ or reading skills either with small groups of students or individually. * Shawnee Elementary School in the Lakota School District, West Chester, Ohio, has a second grade teacher who recruits parents and community members as story tellers. She requests that the volunteers read a specified book at home, address key ideas or concepts, and read the book to the class in an appropriate costume designed and developed by the volunteer. The teacher includes a brief list of her ideas and concepts relevant to the story when she sends the book home to the storyteller. Classroom teachers continue to rely heavily upon parents to chaperone field trips and co-ordinate class parties.</paragraph><paragraph parID="306">* At Britton Elementary, in Hilliard, Ohio, parents are used in the school to make brief tape recordings of students reading. These tapes are sent home to update parents on their child's progress. They are also used to provide documentation of progress for the classroom teacher. In The School At Large Further along the "continuum" for involving parents is to utilize them in school wide activities, not just in their child's classroom. Schools have used parent volunteers in the following ways: Volunteers are often eager to share a hobby, or talent with students through an after school enrichment program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="307">Academic tutoring in an after school setting is another opportunity for volunteers. Volunteers can be utilized to coordinate and actually build lasting school projects such as constructing playground equipment, maintaining athletic fields, grounds beautification, etc. This is a good opportunity to include parents who may not be available during the traditional school day. Volunteers can be invited in to share their cultural heritage, language, and customs. This is a particularly nice mechanism for involving grandparents in a school. * Harrison Elementary, in the Southwest School District, has a volunteer program called "6th Grade Partners." This program matches adults with children who have been identified "at risk" by teachers or counselors in the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="308">They get together for an hour on Thursday evenings for food, projects and positive adult-child interactions. * A school-wide parent volunteer program called Helping Hands has been organized and implemented by parents at Eastgate Elementary school in Elyria, Ohio. Volunteers in this program commit to a regular period of time each week (preferably at least two times a week) that they can come into the school. A schedule of volunteer times is posted and teachers then sign up for when they would like to have a volunteer. Activities can include helping with bulletin boards, working with students on the computer, reading tests, and reinforcing academic skills. Appropriate training occurs before a volunteer begins. (See Figure 3.5)</paragraph><paragraph parID="309">School-wide activities such as fund raisers, book fairs, teacher appreciation lunches and school fun fairs are still primarily coordinated by parent volunteers. Some schools have a Volunteer Coordinator position, with a parent filling the role. A small stipend may be available ($ 500 or so), but is not always necessary. * In Westerville, Ohio, at Huber Ridge Elementary parents of children on an IEP have the opportunity to do public speaking as a part of a team. The team is comprised of administrators and regular and special education teachers. This team has spoken to the Board of Education, the Parent Teacher Organization as well as made district-wide presentations on the topic of inclusion. In one district the Food Services Director requested volunteers, both students and parents, to taste test and rate possible new food items for the school lunch menu.</paragraph><paragraph parID="310">This provided a fun-filled opportunity for parents and children to participate in an activity together that had real consequences for others in the district. It also served to prevent future complaints about the cafeteria. It is becoming increasingly more evident that schools cannot effectively educate students without support and involvement from the student's home. The goal is mutual--every child getting the supports they need to be successful. The challenge lies in how to utilize the strengths both parents and professionals have in ways that are most meaningful, effective, and beneficial for students. The checklist that follows this section may be of benefit as you expand your resources and capabilities and engage volunteers in your school. Benefits when schools have better volunteering programs:</paragraph><paragraph parID="311">Gain skills in communicating with adults Increase awareness of skills and talents from a variety of adults Receive more individual attention For Teachers Help in meeting increased demands Create more opportunities for communication with parents Enrich curriculum with additional projects</paragraph><paragraph parID="312">Do we conduct an annual survey to identify interests, talents, and availability of volunteers? - assisting in the classroom (e. g., tutoring, grading papers, etc.) - helping on trips or at parties - giving presentations (e. g., careers, hobbies, extracurricular events) - checking attendance - monitoring halls, working in the library, cafeteria, or other areas - leading clubs or activities - other school-specific opportunities? Do we provide ways for families to be involved at home or in the community if they cannot volunteer at school? Do we have a program to recognize school volunteers? Do we schedule plays, concerts, games, and other events at different times of the day or evening so that all parents could attend some activity? Just as students with special needs want to be included with typical peers, parents of children with special needs want to be included in typical parent settings. Don't hesitate to involve parents of children with special needs as volunteers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="313">Enroll students with special needs in their neighborhood school where siblings attend, so that a parent's time will not be spread out between buildings and districts For some parents of children with special needs, there may be additional time demands spent with doctors, therapists, tutoring, thus limiting the time they may have to give to the schools. Don't forget to give volunteers training when necessary concerning both job duties as well as policy/procedural issues. Figure 3.2, Parent Involvement philosophy sattement, Milan Elementary School in Milan, Ohio Figure 3.3, Parent Appreciation Night invitation, Benjamin Logan Jr. High School in Bellefontaine, Ohio Figure 3.4, the Bucket Brigate, Mason Heights Elementary in Mason, Ohio</paragraph><paragraph parID="314">Have a basic philosophical belief in the value of parents' and families' expertise and knowledge. Have the money up front to pay for parents' and families' expenses and to provide consulting fees if that is appropriate. Keep families apprised of project happenings through personal phone calls and mailings. Sometimes, a mentoring one-to-one relationship between a professional and a parent works best. Show appreciation for parents' and families' roles. Maintain a feedback loop--as some parents succeed, it becomes a natural motivator for other parents. In addition to the guidelines for family participation at the policy and program level, "The Institute for Family-Centered Care" looks at parents and families as advisors.</paragraph><paragraph parID="315">Acknowledging that there are numerous ways to receive advisory input from parents and families, "The Institute's" suggestions, listed below, may offer some new ideas: Convene focus groups of parents and families as specific issues arise. Hold a monthly family/staff coffee hour. Ask parents and families to "host" a professional-in-training dinner. Solicit family input in community and program needs assessments. Include parents and families on site visit teams to other programs. Hold brainstorming sessions with parents and families before developing educational materials.</paragraph><paragraph parID="316">Include a parent/family panel during orientation for new staff. Develop, with parents and families, a parent satisfaction survey. Develop a "breakfast (or lunch) with the director" program for families. Keep a suggestion book in the waiting room, so parents and families can record their ideas. Invite parents and families to present at in-service programs for staff. In the field of education, involvement and collaboration in decision-making roles usually implies adults. A district-wide policy on parent involvement at the decision-making level would ensure predictable actions on the part of district personnel.</paragraph><paragraph parID="317">Schools can inform parents about vacancies on school boards or community councils, or other opportunities for a parent or family member to serve as an elected representative in school decision-making. Parents share responsibility for their child's education. By involving parents in the decision-making process they become partners. Bringing parents into the educational process increases information resources for teachers and administrators. While strategies for successful individual decision-making are important for all parent/professional relationships, they are most important when they involve a student with identified needs related to a disability. Parent involvement in this decision-making process is not optional; it is required by law. There are many opportunities for parents and students to be decision-makers in the IEP development process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="318">Encourage all attendees, especially parents, to visit proposed placement options prior to conference. Ask parents if all issues have been covered. Ask parents and families for areas of agreement and disagreement and corresponding reasons. Ask parents and families for input on progress and performance levels. Develop consensus about identification of learning need and performance before proceeding. When professionals were asked about the importance of parental input, before an IEP conference, they rated the input very highly. Dr. James Comer, professor of child psychiatry at Yale University, has developed a comprehensive parent-school collaborative effort, referred to as the "Comer Process" (1992).</paragraph><paragraph parID="319">Involving parents as equal partners in a school management and planning team has created a philosophy of shared governance. Effective as a model for parent involvement, the Comer Process requires parent participation in district-level, school-level and individual-level decisions. The form identifies the parents' concerns regarding the student's placement and provides an opportunity to separate children who may cause difficulties when placed together. * North Elementary School, in Newark, Ohio, had teachers, parents, students and administrators form a committee to draft a behavior management plan for the school. For parents; Input into policies that affect their child's education. Feeling ownership of school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="320">All-family awareness of parents' voices in school decisions. Shared experiences and connections with other families. Awareness of school, district and state policies. Address school and community diversity: Include parent leaders and representatives from all racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and other groups in the school. Include students (along with parents) in the decision-making groups. Be sure students with identified needs related to disabilities are represented.</paragraph><paragraph parID="321">Don't forget the three F's --fun, food and family: Decision-making groups need fun-filled opportunities such as ice breakers, tension relievers, and appreciation tokens. Provide child care and schedule meetings so that all parents can participate. Provide food --the more important the decision... the more important the food. Conduct brainstorming sessions with diverse focus groups before assembling decision-making councils, committees or representatives.

An initiative of the Partnership for Family Involvement in Education and the US Department of Education, it began in 1995 with a back-to-school kick-off. The American people, according to the campaign, have identified seven critical actions to improve education. Making schools safe, disciplined and drug-free: A condition for learning Encouraging parent and family involvement</paragraph><paragraph parID="324">Helping America become a reading, literate society Making technology available so all children will succeed in the 21st century Preparing young people for careers: A strong transition from school to work Making college more accessible: Keep the promise of the American dream The back-to-school campaign brought renewed interest to the role communities play in education. Joyce Epstein's sixth and final way that schools can increase the involvement of other stakeholders in the educational process is through collaborations and exchanges with the community. Epstein explains that the collaborations and exchanges take two basic forms:</paragraph><paragraph parID="325">Connections to enable the community to contribute to schools, students and families Connections to enable schools, students and families to contribute to the community. There's no limit to what can be accomplished if it doesn't matter who gets the credit. Milliken Research Corporation Forty years ago, students were recognized as residents and representatives of neighborhoods and small towns. Schools provided a showcase for the talents and abilities of neighborhood children. Neighborhood business owners and organizations supported "their own" by passing tax levies, donating money and materials for school programs, and sponsoring school band and athletic team events.</paragraph><paragraph parID="326">Epstein elaborates on how schools, and communities can initiate and develop exchanges that will help build school communities whatever their geographic description. She lists the following ways: Provide information on community activities that link learning skills and talents, including summer programs for students. Promote service to the community by students, families, and schools (e.g., recycling, art, music, drama, and other activities for seniors or others, etc.). Students and families need information on community health, cultural, recreational, social support, and other programs or services. Resources are particularly important when a student has identified needs related to a disability. The following ideas and suggestions could be useful in providing that information:</paragraph><paragraph parID="327">Hold a "community fair" and invite representatives from area support agencies and organizations to set up displays. In addition to health and support agencies, communities have an opportunity to actively participate in the educational process by offering or sponsoring learning skill activities. Schools should work with area business and civic leaders to elicit their support for programs and strategies that increase learning. Sponsor "Family Math" or "Family Science" programs or events where community members and business people talk about math and science in their careers and lead hands-on activities. Provide leave time to employees to volunteer in schools, encourage parents to take time off to participate in parent-teacher conferences, join the PTA, and provide parent resource centers. Help set a summer reading and literacy program for your community--to read and write 30 minutes a day, five days a week. Reward participants for meeting reading goals with special books from the library, a favorite kid's magazine or a paperback book.</paragraph><paragraph parID="328">* The Greater Dayton Christian Connection, in Dayton, Ohio, established a Networking/Communications Ministry to link churches and to establish a community computing center at a local church site. Experts will train teenagers and adults, including senior citizens, to use computers. * The parents of a first grade student, in a Delhi Hills subdivision, near Cincinnati, held a back-to-school ice cream party for elementary school children living in their neighborhood. The party was planned to show that the community (subdivision) acknowledged the first day of school as an important event. In addition to demonstrating the community's interest in wishing the children a successful school year, the gathering also provided an opportunity for parents to meet each other as "school community" members. Information regarding which parents would be watching bus stops, or children walking to school, could be exchanged at this type of informal neighborhood get-together. Partnerships for Service</paragraph><paragraph parID="329">Help create safe corridors for children on their way to and from school by extending business areas beyond shop doors. Encourage the local paper to cover positive stories about youth activities and accomplishments. Create alternative activities to gangs. * New Choices, a youth program in Dayton, Ohio, works with young people who have been expelled or suspended from school. The selected youth are paired with area senior citizens as companions and assistants. It is administered by the St. Francis Academy, a national nonprofit mental health system out of Salina, Kansas. Additional funding comes from insurance and Medicaid reimbursements for counseling services.</paragraph><paragraph parID="330">* Trotwood-Madison City School District, near Dayton, Ohio, invited community members to discuss a school proposal that would implement an early release every Wednesday afternoon. The early release would give teachers time to research new materials, write curriculum and learn more effective teaching methods. The school district wanted the community to be part of the planning and to share ownership for school decisions. * Crosby Elementary School in southwest Ohio developed a brochure that provides information about the school and serves as an invitation to community members to be involved in the school. Identify and integrate resources and services from the community to strengthen school programs, family practices, and student learning and development. Develop planned service integration of school in partnership with businesses, civic counseling, cultural, health, recreation, and other agencies and organizations. The concepts of busing for integration, and magnet schools for diverse learning opportunities, have reduced the level of school ownership experienced by many community members.</paragraph><paragraph parID="331">Having students, parents and families, and school personnel visible and involved in community activities, may "put a face" on the school at-large. It is important that the strategies implemented by schools be appropriate for their specific community environment. To define parent involvement more operationally, Hoover-Dempsey, Bassler, and Brissie (1987) theorized a two-way breakdown into home-based activities (e.g., parent home tutoring) and school based parent involvement activities (e.g., parent volunteering, attendance at parent-teacher conferences). Gordon's six types of parent involvement (Gordon &amp; Breivogel, 1976) are: (a) the traditional type of parent involvement type (the parent as audience or bystander-observer); (b) parents as decision makers (as in School Advisory Committees or Parent Teacher Associations [PTAs] in which parents participate in school decision making activities); (c) parents begin as classroom volunteers; (d) parent as a paid paraprofessional or teacher's aide; (e) parents as learners (e.g., participate in child development or parenting classes); and (f) parents as teachers of their own children at home. The first is the Parents as Teachers program that helps train parents so that they can teach their own children at home in skills learned at home. comprehensive programs of parent involvement require schools to involve parents at all grade levels in a variety of roles. These programs should be designed to: (a) help parents develop skills and foster conditions at home that support learning, (b) provide parents with the knowledge of techniques designed to assist children in learning at home, (c) provide access to and coordinate community and support services for children and families, (d) promote clear two-way communication between the school and the family to the school programs and children's progress, (e) involve parents, after appropriated training, in instructional and support roles at school, and (f) support parents as decision makers and develop their leadership in governance, advisory, and advocacy roles (p. 361).</paragraph><paragraph parID="332">The Coleman report (Coleman et al., 1966), as well as Mosteller and Moynihan (1972), and Coleman (1975) also reported that home-based variables were at least as important as the school-based variables in accounting for the total amount of student achievement variance. "These are all activities that appear to have a direct impact on student attitudes, behavior, and leaning" (p.81-82). Schools and teachers should develop specific procedures for encouraging and implementing home-based parent involvement. One of these is to use regular home-visits by either the teacher or a trained paraprofessional. Parent Involvement in the Educational Process. Center on School, Family, and Community Partnerships The mission of this Center is to conduct and disseminate research, development, and policy analyses that produce new and useful knowledge and practices that help families, educators, and members of communities work together to improve schools, strengthen families, and enhance student learning and development. Joyce Epstein of Johns Hopkins University has developed a framework for defining six different types of parent involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="333">COMMUNICATING: Design effective forms of school-to-home and home-to-school communications about school programs and children's progress. VOLUNTEERING: Recruit and organize parent help and support. LEARNING AT HOME: Provide information and ideas to families about how to help students at home with homework and other curriculum-related activities, decisions, and planning. DECISION MAKING: Include parents in school decisions, developing parent leaders and representatives. COLLABORATING WITH COMMUNITY: Identify and integrate resources and services from the community to strengthen school programs, family practices, and student learning and development. Parents and schools need to work together so all children can succeed in school. But even though studies show that most parents want to be involved in their children's education, they may not be exactly sure how to go about it, especially if, like most parents, they work during the school day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="334">What Can I Do To Involve Myself With My Child's School? Some schools value parent involvement by providing numerous opportunities for parents to interact with each other, with teachers, and with students. Your child's school can provide ideas on how to participate. One important way you can become involved in your child's schooling is to exercise any choices available in the selection of course work, programs, or even schools. Many schools are moving toward "school-based management," in which administrators share the responsibility for operating schools with teachers, students, parents, and community members. You can become involved in committees that govern your child's school or join the local parent-teacher association. The National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education (NCPIE) says that schools should regularly communicate with parents about their child's progress and the educational objectives of the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="335">This communication should also include non- custodial parents, stepparents, and any other adults, such as grandparents, who are responsible for the child. If you aren't receiving such information, ask for it. Work with other parents and guardians to be sure that the school understands how best to keep you informed. Some schools send newsletters and calendars home regularly, alerting parents to school functions and ways they can participate. Encourage your school to provide volunteer opportunities for working parents and to schedule some school events outside of the school day to increase participation. Visit your child's classroom; a visit will give you an idea of what your child does at school and how he or she interacts with other children. Volunteer to help in the classroom as an assistant (listening to children read, for example, or serving as an aide during computer work).</paragraph><paragraph parID="336">Support student events and performances by helping with them (such as sewing costumes or painting scenery for a school play) and by attending them. If your school has a Parents' Room/Lounge or Parent Center, drop in to meet other parents and teachers there, or to pick up information and materials. Participate in workshops that are offered, such as those on child development or concerns that parents have (or help plan such workshops). Take advantage of parent-teacher contracts (perhaps agreeing to read with your child for a certain amount of time each night). Ask your child's teacher if he or she has materials that you can use to help your child at home and to supplement homework. Be part of decision-making committees about school issues and problems, such as a Parent Advisory Committee. How Can I Help My Child With Homework?</paragraph><paragraph parID="337">Most teachers assign homework on a regular basis because practice is needed before children fully understand new skills or concepts. Homework also increases the amount of learning time available and allows students to do more in-depth learning. Here are some general guidelines for helping with homework: Reward progress; use lots of praise; display good work. Find out how much and what type of homework is assigned in each class, how students are expected to prepare it and turn it in, and what students can do when they don't understand something; help your child manage the workload by dividing it into small doses. Help your child develop a homework schedule that he or she can stick to. Talk to your child each day about homework assignments; go over work; see if it's complete; ask questions about it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="338">But don't do your child's homework yourself. Provide a suitable place for study (if possible, make it quiet and away from the distractions of TV, phone, and loud music). Avoid making homework a punishment. How Can I Make Our Home a Good Place for My Child To Learn? Have high expectations for your child's learning and behavior, both at home and at school. Praise and encourage your child. Emphasize effort and achievement, and be a role model for getting work done before play.</paragraph><paragraph parID="339">Establish rules and routines in the home. Monitor television viewing. Limit after-school jobs and activities. Encourage your child to share information about school and respond with empathy. If you don't do anything else, read to your young child or have him or her read to you every night. Encourage older children to read by reading yourself and by having interesting and appropriate materials available. What Should I Do If My Child Isn't Doing Well in School?</paragraph><paragraph parID="340">Contact your child's teacher. Don't wait for the school to contact you. It's important to resolve problems as soon as possible when they occur. When parents work with teachers, they are often able to improve a child's performance in school. Children also get the sense that education is really important when they see their parents involved with their teachers and their school. Parents feel a sense of accomplishment, too, when they help their children succeed in school. Ask your child's teacher for specific activities you can do at home with your child and help the teacher better understand what works best with your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="341">Make it clear that if the teacher sees a problem developing, you want to hear about it immediately. Then, meet with your child's teacher frequently until the problem is resolved. What If My Child Doesn't Like School? Using your unique knowledge of your child, try to find out why he or she seems unhappy with school. Observe and listen to your child. The problem may not lie with school itself, but with peers or friends. It may also be a family problem or an issue of self- esteem.</paragraph><paragraph parID="342">Arrange for a conference with the teacher or school counselor. Work toward being able to discuss problems with your child openly, and listen carefully to his or her views before you offer any solutions. Children whose parents are involved in their education have better grades, a more positive attitude toward school, and more appropriate school behavior than those with less involved parents. So don't underestimate what YOU, as a parent, can contribute to your child's learning experiences, no matter how much education you yourself have. Getting involved in your child's education will make a difference. Families are important in all phases of their child's educational program, but their presence is especially important and necessary when children have been identified at risk and referred for evaluation and possible special education placement. Once this identification and referral occur for a particular child, educators must make every effort to acquire knowledge of the family's culture including language, customs, and, most important, their perceptions of a disability.</paragraph><paragraph parID="343">Although studies have substantiated the benefits of home-based support, schools that have increased achievement for students from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds are those in which parents participate in many ways, including shared governance. To successfully foster family involvement, it is important to consider the roles that parents from different cultures expect to play in the school system and the different ways in which they view disability. Although individual differences exist within each culture, especially those relating to socioeconomic status or level of formal parent education, an understanding of general research findings can aid educators in understanding the cultural models of disability among different ethnic groups as well as of immigrant parents from these groups. For example, in Cambodian culture, teachers tend to be viewed as authoritarian figures, and parents tend to defer to the teacher's expertise in the education of their children (Barrilleaux &amp; Coulter, 1988). Yalung (2000) recommends that culturally appropriate counseling services be provided to Filipino parents, especially because Filipino culture underscores the importance of listening, which leads to the understanding of the child's and family's needs. This self-blame was so intense for the mothers in this study that 44 percent of them had contemplated suicide with their disabled child to protect the family from social stigma and to avoid financial hardships related to the child's disability. This study points to within-group differences, the need to increase parental knowledge about the physiological roots of their children's disabilities, and the need for culturally relevant family support groups.</paragraph><paragraph parID="344">There needs to be better communication between the school and the home in terms of clarifying what a "disability" constitutes, especially in terms of different disability types, such as autism or attention deficit disorder. Chan (1986) points out that with the heterogeneity of Asian languages, there are also diverse ways in which disabilities are conceptualized, and these conceptions are not always the same as those of American educators. This information is also important in informing the family's view of disability, which is often seen as a punishment for past wrongs or a source of damage to the family's pride. Educators should keep in mind that families who indicate satisfaction with their child's services may be coming from a completely different vantage point than that of non-minority, non-immigrant, non-disadvantaged U.S. parents who have more knowledge of the education system. Since the United States has one of the most advanced systems of special education in the world, especially when compared with those in developing countries where disabled children might not even attend schools, it is no surprise that parent satisfaction may be high. Lynch and Stein (1987) found that 95 percent of the Latino parents interviewed wanted the law to include parent education that covered parental rights, assessment procedures, and discipline skills. For example, Korean immigrant parents might not feel comfortable asking questions in meetings because questioning authority goes against their culture and contradicts how they were expected to act in their native country's schools (Park &amp;amp; Turnbull, 2001).</paragraph><paragraph parID="345">When schools conceptualize a family involvement model, they must understand that considering and affirming families' participation patterns are critical and necessary components to eliminate disproportionality. It is conceivable that schools and families may have different interpretations of the nature and amount of parental/family involvement. These distinct differences must be identified and dealt with to avoid misperceptions of parents that may be deeply rooted in cultural beliefs and attitudes. This is especially important, since cultural and linguistic differences can be roadblocks in family-school communication. Minority families tend not to be highly involved in the special education process, partially because of these barriers (Garcia, Perez &amp; Ortiz, 2000). Other barriers may include a lack of time (parents may work multiple jobs), a lack of resources (parents may not have a means of transportation to the school), or a lack of knowledge about the education system and their expected roles within it. Educators often complain that minority parents do not care about their children's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="346">But the lack of participation among culturally and linguistically diverse parents does not necessarily indicate a lack of interest in their children's progress. The family's cultural knowledge, as well as other types of knowledge and support, should be a valuable source of expertise to all educators (Moll, 1992). Only when schools actively use expertise from the home, in addition to offering their own expertise, can a truly reciprocal relationship and collaborative effort begin to develop. When a child has a disability, parents use different models in explaining the disability. Some Filipino parents cope by viewing the disability as a gift from God and a retribution for sins, which will bring good luck to the family. According to Harry (1992), the strong sense of family pride that Latino families tend to have makes the acceptance of a severe disability difficult for family members. Harry (1992) also found that Latino families may not recognize mild disabilities, especially when the child's behavior corresponds with Latino cultural norms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="347">However, this parent satisfaction does not necessarily indicate that schools are always providing quality services. The mothers in this study did not believe that their children had communication disorders and were not concerned that their children's language development did not meet the milestones appropriate for their age. The Mexican American parents tended to view nurturing over teaching as their primary responsibility and focused on the nature and content of communication over milestones. Understand different cultural models of disability. Whether the family members with whom educators and other service providers are working are from Asian, Latino, African-American, or other cultures, it is important to understand the different cultural models of disability held by each family. There is a need to understand how family members define "disability" and, further, to ensure that all parties work from the same definition. It is important to explain complex medical definitions and legal jargon to parents, especially if they have limited English proficiency or are recent immigrants.</paragraph><paragraph parID="348">Although translators may find that providing concise translations is challenging, their contributions can nevertheless be useful. The U. S. model of schooling, including special education and legalized services for children with special needs, may not be the norm in the family's country of origin. Explain to parents the roles expected of them. The special education process in the United States depends heavily on parent participation. Allow parents ample time for questions and make it clear that they are expected to ask questions. at-risk student: Students may be labeled "at risk" if not succeeding in school based on information gathered from test scores, attendance or discipline problems. They are run by groups of teachers, parents, and/or foundations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="349">Family Math: A University of California at Berkeley program that teaches families how to enjoy doing math together.

Individual Education Program (IEP): A written plan created for a student with learning disabilities by his or her teacher(s), parents or guardians, the school administrator, and other interested parties. For example, when students are learning about historic events in social studies, in English class they may study a novel set in that historic period. IQ: Shortened term for "intelligence quotient." It is supposed to reflect a person's mental capabilities, but these tests have become more controversial in recent years. Critics claim they measure only a limited number of intellectual abilities, primarily "school smarts," while others say the tests are biased against members of some minority groups.</paragraph><paragraph parID="350">K-8: Schools that include kindergarten through eighth grade classes, combining elementary and middle schools. language arts: Another term for English class. A way for parents to enroll their children in schools they choose. planning period: A period set aside for teachers to plan curriculum, meet with parents, and evaluate student progress. While these types of plans vary, they usually give control of a school's operation to a school council composed of parents, teachers, and local administrators. Student Study Team: A team of educators, convened at the request of a classroom teacher, parent, or counselor, that designs in-class intervention techniques to meet the needs of a particular student. The team can consist of the primary teacher, the parent or guardian of the student, two specialists (speech therapist, psychologist, or counselor), an objective teacher (who does not teach the student in any class), and/or the principal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="351">Six weeks after implementing a program (counseling, tutoring, or special assignments) for the student, the team reconvenes to determine if further steps, including a transfer to special education classes, are necessary. teachers' assistants: Volunteers or parents who assist teachers in the classroom. thematic units: A unit of study that has lessons focused on a specific theme, sometimes covering all core subject areas. For example, the theme of inequality may be explored by studying the caste system in India and slavery in the American South. It is often used as an alternative approach to teaching history or social studies chronologically. Title One: A federally funded program designed to improve the academic achievement of students scoring below the 50th percentile on standardized tests. Home-based parental involvement (such as helping with homework ), on the other hand, produces unclear results.</paragraph><paragraph parID="352">Some studies find home-based involvement to be effective while others find it to be ineffective, or even problematic. In fact, some researchers noted that parents who helped with homework the most had kids who did the worst in school. This probably occurred, however, because kids who struggle with academics are most likely to get help from parents, making the data misleading. More research is clearly needed for us to best understand how parents' involvement in education affects kids. All in all, though, it's safe to say that any degree of involvement is better than none at all. In addition, it seems that only helping out at home may not be enough to make a major difference in your child's education. If you want your child to benefit to the fullest extent, be sure to also open communications with her teachers and administrators and to attend school events as often as you can.</paragraph><paragraph parID="353">Studies have consistently shown that parents' involvement in education has a positive impact on kids' academics , especially if they're struggling. Parent involvement also seems to have broader positive effects on children, as well as on teachers and on parents themselves. You're right to suspect, though, that one type of parental involvement may produce stronger effects than the other. In particular, school-based parental involvement (such as attending parent-teacher conferences ) has the clearest effects on students, teachers and parents. The majority of research has also been conducted on this type of involvement, probably because it's the easiest to observe. Table 2: Percentage of Students In Grades K-12 Whose Parents Reported Involvement in Their Child's School, by Type of Involvement and Selected Characteristics, 2007 Students with parents who are involved in their school tend to have fewer behavioral problems and better academic performance, and are more likely to complete high school than students whose parents are not involved in their school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="354">Involvement allows parents to monitor school and classroom activities, and to coordinate their efforts with teachers to encourage acceptable classroom behavior and ensure that the child completes schoolwork. Parental involvement in school, as measured by attendance at a general meeting, a meeting with a teacher, or a school event, and by volunteering or serving on a committee, rose significantly between 1999 and 2007. In 2007, 89 percent of students in kindergarten through twelfth grade had parents who attended a general meeting, compared with 78 percent in 1999. Seventy-eight percent had parents who attended a scheduled meeting with a teacher, 74 percent had parents who attended a school event, and 46 percent of students had parents who volunteered in school or served on a committee in 2007, compared with 73, 65, and 37 percent, respectively, in 1999. Parents are most likely to attend school meetings and events or to volunteer in their child's school when their children are in primary school. For example, in 2007, a little more than 90 percent of students in kindergarten through fifth grade had parents who attended a meeting with their teachers, while 76 percent of middle-school students, and 61 percent of ninth- through twelfth-grade students, had parents who had done so. Differences by Race and Hispanic Origin</paragraph><paragraph parID="355">Sixty-five percent of both Hispanic and black students had parents who attended school events, while 80 percent of white students had parents who had done so. For example, in 2007, more than 80 percent of students whose parents had a Bachelor's degree or higher had parents who attended a school event, compared with 48 percent for students whose parents had less than a high school education. For example, in 2007, 51 percent of parents of children living above the poverty line acted as volunteerd or served on a committee at their child's school, compared with 26 percent of parents of children living at or below the poverty line. Parents who do not speak English (parents who did not learn English as a child and currently speak a non-English language in the home) are less likely than other parents to attend a general school meeting or school event, or to volunteer or serve on a committee. For example, in 2007, 57 percent of parents who do not speak English reported attending a school event, compared with 63 percent of parents where one parent does not speak English, and 77 percent of parents who both spoke English. There were no significant differences by parents' language status, however, for the percentage that attend scheduled meetings with the teacher. Low-income parents' involvement in school may be hindered by transportation difficulties, chronic health conditions, or conflicts with work schedules, while parents whose primary language is not English may not feel able to participate in school activities, or may belong to a culture where questioning teachers is not a norm.</paragraph><paragraph parID="356">Schools have employed several strategies to increase parental involvement in school, ranging from extensive promotion of events such as "back to school" nights, to school-based cultural events in areas with large immigrant populations. Large-scale initiatives, such as the community schools movement, are also designed to increase disadvantaged families' involvement in school by making the school a hub of social services for the neighborhood. However, few studies have rigorously evaluated the effects of such programs on parental involvement. Parental involvement in school is defined as parent reported participation at least once during the school year in attending a general school meeting; attending a scheduled meeting with their child's teacher; attending a school event; or volunteering in the school or serving on a school committee.

W.  Running in place:  How American families are faring in a changing economy and individualistic society. Does parent involvement help students increase their academic achievement and emotional well-being? Parent involvement definitely pays off for the children of those parents who get involved in their children's education. In A New Wave of Evidence, a review of fifty-one (51) studies published between 1995 and 2002, Anne T. Henderson and Karen L. Mapp found that students with involved parents are more likely to: Earn high grades and test scores, and enroll in higher-level programs</paragraph><paragraph parID="358">Be promoted, pass their classes and earn credits Attend school regularly Have better social skills, show improved behavior and adapt well to school Graduate and go on to postsecondary education The children of parents who participated in an interactive homework program developed by Johns Hopkins University in 1997 had higher writing scores and better grades in language arts. Once parents understand the positive benefits of participation, they can work closely with teachers and school administrators to ensure student success academically, socially and emotionally. Parents overwhelmingly think only about their child's needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="359">However, they also need to think about how their participation benefits the whole school. Once they do understand the concept of parental participation in the school, they realize that it benefits all students. Parents also need to maintain open communication with their child's school administrators and teachers. There is also plenty of proof that school-wide parent involvement efforts translate into academic gains. A long-term study completed in 2001 by Westat and Policy Studies Associates of 71 high-poverty schools in seven states showed that students' test scores rose 40% from third grade to fifth grade in schools where teachers reported high levels of parent outreach. Approximately 700 sixth and eighth graders and their families took part in the study. Please remain involved in your child's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="360">Boston College professor Dennis Shirley wrote about the IAF's decades-long efforts in his 1997 book Community Organizing For Urban School Reform . When schools engage parents they are leading with the parents' self-interests (their wants and dreams) in an effort to develop a genuine partnership. What are the important differences between the two? Here are a few key points to keep in mind: When we're involving parents, ideas and energy tends to come from the schools and from government mandates. A hundred and fifty Indian students who were studying in National Type Tamil Schools in the district of Kerian, Perak Darul Ridzuan were randomly chosen based on stratified random sampling. The sample comprised 50 students from Year Three, 50 students from Year Four and 50 students from Year Five.</paragraph><paragraph parID="361">Structured interviews were conducted with the respondents. Questionnaires were used by the researcher to obtain quantitative data related to the school-parents partnership and the parents' involvement strategies implemented for their child's education. The findings of this study indicate a moderate relationship in school-parents partnership in enhancing Indian parents' involvement in their child's education. The more the parents feel welcome at school, the higher their involvement in their child's education. The parents also show higher involvement when the school is cooperative in discussing their child. In addition, findings also indicate that parents are more involved in their child's education when the parents are kept informed about the meetings, activities and events that they have to attend. The upshot on this piece is likely comforting for many parents of middle schoolers, folks who are often frustrated that they can't be or their kids won't let them be or their schools aren't as open to them being as involved as they were in the elementary school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="362">That's OK. The kids are different; the involvement can be different. Seems like a natural progression. A new research survey on parental involvement in middle school nails down an answer: The best way to promote achievement in middle school isn't to help student with their homework, or even to volunteer for school fundraisers. Instead, middle-school students posted the best results in school when their parents stepped back a bit and moved into more of a "coaching role," teaching them to value education, relate it to daily life and set high goals for themselves, says the study, published recently in the journal Developmental Psychology . You are encouraged to become involved in your child's education in a number of ways: Assist in getting homework done promptly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="363">Establish a working relationship with your child's teacher.

Magical thinking in narratives of adolescent cutters Adolescents sometimes cut themselves to relieve distress; however, the mechanism is unknown. Previous studies have linked self-injury to deficits in processing emotions symbolically through language. Most students experience significant amounts of stress, but with all of the activities and responsibilities that fill a student&#146;s schedule, it&#146;s sometimes difficult to find the time to try new stress relievers to help dissipate that stress.

Unfortunately, educators often find themselves preaching to the choir, and even risk making those who are already involved feel burdened or guilty for not doing more. Is it worth it? Studies show that special efforts to engage parents make a difference-a big difference-in student success in school. Earn higher grades and test scores, and enroll in higher-level programs. Have better social skills, show improved behavior, and adapt well to school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="370">Successful Family Involvement Clearly, family involvement in children's education is a good thing. It's important to continue "preaching to the choir," because there will always be a core group of families that participate above and beyond the call of duty. They need to be supported and made to feel welcome as much as anyone else. You can find loads of helpful tips to make your school inviting and warm for families. But what if it's not working for everyone? What if there are large numbers of families that stay just out of reach?</paragraph><paragraph parID="371">Schools that are determined to create a partnership with families can ask the following questions. What is the definition of successful parent involvement? Does it mean attending every PTA/PTO meeting and bringing cookies for the bake sales? The answer is "Maybe...maybe not." Families can be involved in a variety of ways, such as: Helping their children with homework and providing a safe, supportive home life that encourages learning Two-way communication with the school, through notes, calls, conferences, reading newsletters, and reviewing report cards</paragraph><paragraph parID="372">Volunteering their time and expertise (a writer might assist with the school newsletter, a builder can help rebuild playground equipment) Encouraging partnerships with the community (in one community, parents involved with the town library board sought connections with the school through shared programming such as plays, volunteer artists-in-residence, and music performances related to school themes) And yes, attending events and PTA/PTO meetings How do we measure successful family involvement? There are plenty of useful tools available to measure successful partnerships between schools and families (for example, the national PTA organization's survey ). The irony and challenge, of course, is that if schools are not reaching some families, there's a good chance those families will not be filling out the forms. Sometimes, the best measure of success is as simple as walking through your school, observing the numbers of families coming in each day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="373">One Louisville, Kentucky, school that is committed to a strong family/teacher partnership says it well: "The best measure of the school's success in drawing parents into the school building is the day-to-day presence of parents-helping in classrooms, doing volunteer administrative work, contributing to policy decisions, taking adult education classes, seeking services at the Family Resource Center , meeting with teachers, or just visiting the school." Any number of issues or backgrounds could get in the way: lack of time, work conflicts, financial demands, socioeconomic status, country of origin, first language, gender, past negative experiences with educators, child-care issues, feeling on the defensive about one's child...the list goes on. It's important not to make assumptions. Parents do care, and it is worth expending the effort for families that don't show up. To get an honest assessment of your school's "approachability," one idea adapted from the National School Public Relations Association's School Communications Workshop Kit is to gather several people you know from outside the community, including representatives from some of the cultures that seem hardest to reach. Ask these individuals to pose as new parents "shopping" your school. Seek their feedback about their experience from the moment they enter the school (who greets them, and how?)</paragraph><paragraph parID="374">until they leave, including their impressions of the building and grounds, teachers, students, and overall feel of the school. This may give principals and teachers, who are so familiar with the school already, a fresh sense of the environment, and of the direction they might want to take the school in order to be more inviting and inclusive. Some families may be more comfortable meeting away from school. Throughout the year, perhaps even monthly, have teachers, principals, and/or other administrators make themselves available in the community at places parents typically gather. Be creative and ask around: coffee shops, playgrounds, even grocery stores may be just the spot. Announce ahead of time that you will be there (be sure to get the permission of the business owner) and want to meet parents and answer questions. Seek support from the clergy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="375">Religious leaders may hold a lot of sway with some families. Ask the local clergy for support and suggestions in reaching key groups in the congregation that you haven't been successful in reaching previously. Meeting in a church, temple, or other place of worship may be much more comfortable than entering the school. Keep it casual, positive, and light on "agenda." Share positive news about what's happening in the school, and seek input from guests about a particular issue that the school or district is facing. Staff in one Seattle, Washington, school volunteered to take part in the Breaking Down Barriers project to establish good communication and relationships with parents. If the caller finds out any family needs or issues, the information is routed to a Family Partnerships Team.</paragraph><paragraph parID="376">Staff receives training and support from this team. Enlist your "choir." Sometimes becoming involved is as simple as being directly invited. Change meeting times. One school in New Hampshire alternates PTO meeting times: one month they're held at 6:00 p.m., the next month they're at 2:45 p.m. Both meeting times include free childcare. Offer parent leadership classes and other programs in multiple languages for immigrant families and those from specific ethnic groups. Empathy, friendship skills, joining a group, active listening, expressing concern, accepting differences, making conversation, similarities and differences, problem solving, goal setting...sound familiar?</paragraph><paragraph parID="377">What are the barriers to closer family-school involvement? Some families may seem to be indifferent or even reluctant to engage with the school, but educators need to look deeper than the surface to determine the true reasons for the lack of enthusiasm. Ask if he or she would be willing to host an informal gathering in his or home to get to know the principal, teachers, superintendent, or other school personnel. Break down barriers. Parents who can't make one meeting time can often make the other. These programs empower parents to become leaders in their homes, schools, and communities. The review established that parental involvement has a significant positive effect on children's achievement, and that the kind of involvement that makes the most difference is the conversations parents have with their children at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="378">Parental involvement The importance of parental involvement in children's education is well evidenced. But how much difference does parental involvement make and what kind of involvement makes the difference? For this TLA research summary we have summarised a literature review of studies that explored the impact of parental involvement on children's educational progress and strategies for enhancing their involvement. Desforges, C. and A. Abouchaar. The impact of parental involvement, parental support and family education on pupil achievement and adjustment: a review of the literature . DfES, RR433, 2003.</paragraph><paragraph parID="379">The review emphasised that parent-child conversations in the home are more valuable, in terms of enhancing pupil achievement, than parents' involvement in school activities. This does not mean that traditional activities, such as parents helping in the classroom and meeting with teachers at school have no value - there may be lots of indirect benefits of such contact, and in any case, such contact can be directly geared to encouraging and supporting parents in talking with their children about their learning at home. It is just that on their own they cannot be linked with achievement in the evidence available to date. We have found this summary more challenging to write than others. Creating TLA research features from research reviews is always difficult because of the complexity and range of the data. But this is challenging in another way. The study's findings have meant we have not been able to focus on activities that take place in school - but rather on ways in which schools can encourage parental involvement in learning at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="380">Nevertheless, the powerful findings that call us to reflect on our current practices make this an important study for us to wrestle with. In this summary we examine the evidence relating to the difference parents can make to their children's learning - in particular through parent-child conversations. We also look at reasons why some parents don't get involved at home as much as they might (because, for example, they do not know how they can help) and explore ways of fostering parental involvement (such as setting interactive homework that is specifically designed to encourage children to talk with adults at home). We think the research summary will increase practitioners' understanding of the importance of trying to involve parents in more extended and meaningful conversations with their children, whilst the case studies offer some practical suggestions for ways of increasing parents' involvement. The summary also discusses how the review's findings about parental involvement might be used to inform attempts at closing the social class achievement gap. We chose this case study because it described the Involving School Parents in Reading and Mathematics (Inspire) project, an initiative set up by Birmingham LA's Core Skills Development Partnership. It was (and remains) a multi-agency programme aiming to encourage the involvement of families and parents in their children's literacy and numeracy in all of Birmingham's 370 primary and nursery schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="381">The project's premise was that by engaging parents and families in their children's learning, not only does children's achievement rise, but adults and siblings also learn. Specifically the aims of Inspire were: to achieve more effective partnerships between school and home to enhance and increase the opportunities for learning in and through the home for schools to share information about teaching and learning in school with parents to contribute to raising achievement in literacy and numeracy. increased educational activity in the home in 73% of schools</paragraph><paragraph parID="382">increased parental understanding of children's learning in 88% of schools raised achievement in literacy and numeracy in 61% of schools. Evidence showed that over 40 000 parents were involved with their child's teacher in relation to literacy and numeracy skills development each year, including some groups who have been hard to engage, such as men and some minority ethnic families. According to Moody and Barrett, 'stress can widen the gap between administrators and teachers." However, the same study found a couple of principals who help their teachers cope with their stress. Another principal admitted that stress is often overlooked, "It is vital that we identify situations that might cause undue anxiety and stress among our staff." His sentiments are echoed by this statement, "We should also do what we can to prevent these situations, as well as provide support for our staff to relieve stress at the workplace."</paragraph><paragraph parID="383">This law now includes many of the parent involvement provisions of the PARENT Act and, for the first time, defines the term "parent involvement" based on National PTA's National Standards for Family-School Partnership Programs. We define "parent involvement" as the participation of parents in every facet of children's education and development from birth to adulthood, recognizing that parents are the primary influence in children's lives. Parent involvement takes many forms, including: Two-way communication between parents and schools Supporting parents as children's primary educators and integral to their learning Encouraging parents to participate in volunteer work Sharing responsibility for decision making about children's education, health, and well-being</paragraph><paragraph parID="384">Collaborating with community organizations that reflect schools' aspirations for all children Through the efforts of National PTA, ESEA expands and formalizes parent involvement to benefit student achievement. Parents' participation on decision-making committees is expanded, States will evaluate school-level parent involvement practices to ensure they are effective, Technical assistance will be provided to schools having difficulty implementing parent involvement activities. Parents must realize that they have the primary responsibility for their child ' s education. Education begins with the family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="385">Convey positive attitudes toward the school. Respect for school personnel must be taught in the home. Encourage your children to use their minds. Help them to apply what they learn in school to real life situations. This will help them to realize that what they learn in school and out of school are tied together. Be sure your child has a quiet place where he or she can study in private, away from other family members, radio, television, etc. Read to your children , beginning when they are very small.</paragraph><paragraph parID="386">Good reading is essential, even in this age of computerized education. When they are old enough to read by themselves, have them read to you or take turns reading to each other. This is a good way to be sure your children are reading their textbooks, and understand what they are reading. Take the time to review the books your children are using in school. If you know what they are studying, you will be better prepared to help them and evaluate their progress. Ask your child to describe what they did that day in a specific subject area. Use open-ended questions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="387">Just asking what they did in school usually brings a "nothing" response. Don ' t emphasize the grade students earn. Instead, emphasize what they have learned in that area and how you can help them learn even more. Be prepared with your own questions and concerns, and also be prepared to listen to what the teacher has to say. As responsible citizens, parents should make an effort to learn more about educational issues and exercise their right s to voice their opinions and vote. Encourage your school board to develop parent involvement policies that would support parents as decision makers and develop their leadership in governance, advisory, and advocacy roles. Advocate for legislation and policies that protect the right of parental involvement in shared decision making.</paragraph><paragraph parID="388">Learn about the selection policies and processes for choosing curriculum materials in your school, community, and state. Find a place for PTA and parent involvement in that process. Work with state teacher certification agencies to require parent/family involvement training for teacher certification and re-certification. Before scheduling meetings and events, be mindful of the ethnic and cultural backgrounds in your PTA community. Try to avoid scheduling conflicts between PTA and other community events. Then plan informative programs and projects to meet those needs. Know, help, and interact with students, teachers, administrators , and community, and facilitate interactions between them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="389">Remind parents and teachers that they are allies in the quest for their child ' s education. Each site was staffed five days per week by the coordinator, while the primary substitute trained beside the coordinator one day per week and substituted in his/her absence. One or two substitute coordinators were hired at each site, averaging two days per month. Substitutes were drawn from the school faculty and community, with particular efforts to secure certified teachers. Youth received homework assistance from the site coordinators who were certified teachers on the faculty of the given school site. This arrangement allowed for contact between the coordinators and regular day classroom teachers in cases where ADACPP youth were experiencing problems with homework assignments. The Me-Me Drug Prevention Program, a kindergarten through sixth grade alcohol and other drug prevention program, provided exercises in self-esteem building and decision making.</paragraph><paragraph parID="390">Classroom teachers received one day of in-service training to implement the program and implementation was then monitored throughout the first year of use. To provide a disaggregated intervention and test the independent effect of the self-esteem-building exercises, the Me-Me program was replaced in eight of the 24 schools by an extended homework period, 90 minutes in length. The field trips were to such locations as hospital detox units and state correctional facilities, with the rationale being that exposing youth to the possible consequences of substance use might act as a deterrent. The investigation focused on demonstrating and evaluating whether the ADACPP program could reduce certain precursors of alcohol and other drug use thought to place latchkey youth at particularly high risk. Self-esteem - The link between low self-esteem and the risk of substance use was the central concept in the design of ADACPP. However, past research on this issue suggests that the reasons for higher drug use among latchkey children may be unrelated to differences in self-esteem. Evaluation: The Effectiveness of an After-School Program for Primary Grade Latchkey Students on Precursors of Substance Abuse</paragraph><paragraph parID="391">To measure the effects of: (1) ADACPP participation on the child's academic performance and overall school behavior, (2) ADACPP participation, improved academic performance, and exposure to self-esteem-building exercises on the child's self-esteem, and (3) ADACPP participation on the prevalence of depression and of risk-taking behavior. We are so focused on making up what we've lost in our own schools that we do not notice how bad it is at other schools, especially those that do not have volunteers and fund raising. I think volunteering should be an optional and occasional occurrence. It has become a full-time endeavor for many parents. This strain has never been more stressful than during the K-8 transition. I see parent volunteers who have nothing left to give their children. They continue on the track of hyper-volunteerism because they fear the unknown due to the lack of planning and funding from PPS.</paragraph><paragraph parID="392">We really need to organize to repair the fundamental problems with this system. I say we move to a place where there is less need for parental involvement. We need to move toward more funding and stability for our schools from year to year. I think we are part of the problem when the district tells us to reconfigure schools and we volunteer to do all the work out of fear of it not getting done. Forgive me for thinking out loud here for a minute. I am still learning how all of this stuff works, the history, and what the smart people who have been doing this for awhile already know. I have a thread going about parent involvement and have been getting some really great ideas so far.</paragraph><paragraph parID="393">It sounds like there is a great deal of inconsistency when it comes to parent involvement on the part of the schools. Some require it, some reject it, some treat kids like patients and don't even allow you to visit your child much less help out (special education), and some let you until you challenge a practice/policy and then ostracize you. I agree that parents should not get involved out of desperation and that schools should not take advantage of parents or allow interest classes to replace what should already be there like languages. I see how parents getting involved creates a slippery slope and as Steve said an "existential threat". I have posted a little on how I feel about behavior rooms but also know that sometimes these work for kids so want to be objective. Full disclosure is that I believe we can do better than segregation within a school building but want to be careful and respectful as I gather information about other's experience here. My values are based on full-inclusion while recognizing we cannot do this top down and small steps are needed to help people value this as well as these kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="394">To follow up on the K-8 task force link, it no longer appears on the default home page, but if you click on the new and improved web site preview, it shows up there. But at least you can access the documents more easily. I think she means an eighth-grade class where they don't change classes and have the same teacher for language arts, math, science, everything but music, library and PE. (If the school happens to offer those things.) I lived for changing classes in middle school - we were forever tormenting our poor teachers and it gave them a break. Plus it got us ready for high school so it wasn't a total shock. In talking with another teacher, whose children attend the same K-8 as mine, she too is disappointed with the meager "enrichment" offerings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="395">I am grateful that these teachers feel obligated to teach anything at all. Our principal, by the way, is telling us our courses need to be graded. Perhaps that is why, as the study hall teacher, I had the highest enrollment. Just a note from a parent who attended the Kindergarten round-up of Winterhaven, and who initially thought that our child would be a good fit there.... Winterhaven does not have a well-rounded program and I did not feel that she would receive complete 'enrichment' from the classes taught there. It's great to be Math/Science focused, but you still need the arts, music, PE to create a well-rounded and enriched child. Also, after touring both K-5 (Llewellyn and Grout), and K-8 school formats(Winterhaven and Sunnyside Environmental), I am convinced that K-3 kids do NOT belong in the same environment as middle-school aged kids. I'm talking about Alameda and Ainsworth and other "wealthy" schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="396">Here is where I want to add a piece from my own personal philosophy however and see how you all can help me shape it without sabotaging the need for funding stability as a bottom line. I have said this in other threads but in my work I have helped parents about to lose their kids do a complete 180. The defining moment is not judging them, getting to know their story, and accepting them for who they are and not what you think a parent should be. My intention with the thread I started on parent involvement is to figure out how to create inclusive communities where you don't have to join the PTO/A to be involved and avoiding cliques that form that only exist to judge others worth based on their contribution. I think within reason parents have a lot to offer from their experience (is there a policy on this or is it just happening...seems like rules should be standardized) but at the same time we can come together and push on the district and the board. First, you can have the most fantastic credentials ever in your field, but if you don't know how to manage a classroom of 8th graders you don't know jack. I do think it works best when 1) it is in small, manageable chunks, like two week residencies 2) the teacher is there to help and lead 3) or, the volunteer works with smaller pull-out groups.</paragraph><paragraph parID="397">Her son is taking knitting. Who fails study hall? Add pe to my already stressed out schedule of reading, writing, math, and social studies. S.W. - when the kids in my daughter's second grade class would start spinning out, their teacher would call out, Kickball! Again and again we see it: in less wealthy schools principals spend FTE on "core" academics (those darn tests again) at the expense of not just libraries, the arts, and foreign languages but also science, literature, writing, economics, business and history. This includes understanding how libraries are organized; locating books in a catalog and then relating that to a shelf location; using reference materials-including online sources;self selecting appropriate books; recognizing genres; and research skills. A library program done right requires year long planning, collaboration with teachers, an understanding of grade by grade curriculum and state standards, and support from administration.</paragraph><paragraph parID="398">A library run by volunteers can circulate books with the old fashioned card and pocket method. Libraries-staff and annual book purchasing funds-should be one of those off the top, district wide programs, along with PE, music, and counselors. Libraries - The Office of Teaching and Learning is mapping out a district plan for libraries. There are newly dedicated resources in the form of TOSAs and a project manager tasked with this. Recommendations from this effort will also feed into the budget discussion. Bell times/length of school day - Analysis is ongoing to determine how to rearrange the bus schedules to get all schools to a 6.5 hour student day. The facilities challenges are ongoing across all of our schools PK-12 and a lot of work will commence shortly with the community to finalize a vision and plan - culminating in a bond.</paragraph><paragraph parID="399">Feel free to email Joan or I will thoughts and suggestions. If the district can't do this then they need to rearrange school boundaries so they can or make some other adjustments. Hi, Sara - I'm very glad to hear that the K8 team is busily working and I look forward to getting some updates. You stated, "Using the largest middle school (W. Sylvan with 900 students) as an example of what is common across middle schools is actually not particularly representative as they have both economies of scale and a very invested parent population working in their favor. Just to clarify, I was not using W. Sylvan as an "example of what is common across middle schools." I was merely giving an example of a pretty significant difference in offerings that I am personally aware of. The fact is that I have no real idea of what is "representative" in terms of non-core offerings (I'm trying to avoid the offensive word "enrichments"), since it seems virtually impossible to find accurate comparative information across schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="400">This is one of the many issues that I think should be addressed by the forthcoming Enrollment and Transfer Committee. More to the point, I think your explanation that Sylvan is not representative because of the nature of the parent base and its size are pretty telling and point to precisely the kinds of inequities that this blog focuses on. "Invested parents" - I have no doubt that the Sylvan families contribute mightily to the school, both in time and money. I applaud their efforts and feel bad that I can't do the same for my kid. This means that families who are probably in a position to provide all kinds of extra-curricular opportunities for their kids can leverage public resources to do it during school hours using school resources at a significant savings. For one thing, they tend to be very short term, typically 5-6 weeks. In addition, kids in grades 6-8 can choose one among three official, year-long electives offered: Spanish, theatre, and study hall.</paragraph><paragraph parID="401">The third elective is a study hall. I think we should come up with a term that implies that the subjects are not fluff, but essential to a child's development with proven beneficial effects on both academic achievement and student retention. As of the last community meeting, the PK8 team said they would be "finalizing recommendations and reporting to the Superintendent and Board by the end of June." Access to library services, and a library is another area of concern for many of our K-8&#8242;s. I cannot begin to say if this has been an effective strategy - but I must say that it seems rather bizarre that parents are encouraged to teach electives, but are not allowed to support a school library? I'd love to hear some testimonials from teachers and parents who know what's happening in the K-8s these days, three years into the implementation. My childs school is now k-7 and will add 8th in the fall...I can't find any information on the school's own website, and certainly none on the PPS website- I have little knowledge of what these students class choices are, whether or not they switch classrooms- if so, for which subjects, do they have the option of any before or after school homework support, and so on.</paragraph><paragraph parID="402">Each time I've asked other parents of 5th graders ( my childs grade ), I get a different answer- some say they think no one yet knows, partly because of the budget issues. In the case of MLC, they allow parents to teach classes...unsupervised by licensed teachers...and have done so for years. The MLC classes are varied and offer great choices...the parents in our K-8 are just as talented and have as much to offer...Anyway...it is an untapped source of energy. I want some background on this because I think it sounds great that parents have this opportunity. I think we are setting our standards too low if we think it is acceptable for parents to teach enrichment or any other classes during the school day. We have a lot of smart and talented parents at our schools but they are no substitute for a trained professional. I think we are still avoiding the real issues when we start scraping the bottom of the educational barrel with talk of parents substituting for teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="403">When the parents didn't show up, which was more than once for each trimester course, the classroom teacher threw something together to fill the time. Collaboration makes sense to me vs. doing the job of a teacher. As I said in my original post, I applaud all the parents who pull these classes together. Be forewarned that while these suggestions are based, in part, on established guidelines, we are attempting to clarify what has been a blurred and overly complex message to schools about how to prepare for, recognize, and treat the allergic emergencies that occur at school. The first step is for you, the allergist, to educate the parents and the patient about how to avoid their allergens or triggers, how to recognize early signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis or asthma, and when and how to ask for help. Having recently given the food allergy/anaphylaxis diagnosis some serious consideration, I believe that for each allergic food reaction, we need to separate the food reaction into "food allergy " or " food-induced anaphylaxis" so that our patients and school personnel get a clear message! Food-induced anaphylaxis: If any allergy patients ( pre-diagnosed food allergy ) has had a food-induced anaphylaxis ( past history ) anytime in the past (characterized by at least two systems of involvement, e.g., cutaneous and respiratory), and, subsequently, (e.g., at school) ingests that food allergen ( exposure ) and develops any sign or symptom of anaphylaxis ( presumed reaction , e.g., even if only hives, or involving one system), consider this "food-induced anaphylaxis" and implement the "food anaphylaxis action plan" in this order :</paragraph><paragraph parID="404">Food-induced anaphylaxis (equivalent): Patients ( pre-diagnosed food allergy ) who have had only single system involvement (e.g. only hives) in reaction to foods recognized to have a high risk of mortality ( high risk past history to the big four: peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish or fish), and who may have been exposed to one of those allergens ( presumed exposure ) should be treated identically to patients who have had prior reactions involving two systems, as previously discussed ( food anaphylaxis action plan ). Any patient with asthma who also has ANY food allergy ( pre-diagnosed asthma and food allergy ) with one system of involvement ( high-risk past history ) and who may have been exposed to his or her allergen(s) ( presumed exposure ) may be treated in like manner ( food anaphylaxis action plan ). In my practice, those considered to have moderate or severe asthma would fall into this category. "Food Allergy" : Patients, without asthma or with only mild asthma ( pre-diagnosed food allergy ) who have had a previous reaction to a lower risk of mortality food (e.g. milk or egg) involving only one system ( low-risk past history ) and who may have been exposed to a food to which they are allergic ( presumed exposure ) may be provided with an alternate "food allergy emergency plan." With inadvertent exposure to this food allergen and only a single system of involvement ( low-risk reaction ), the patient could be administered an antihistamine and closely observed. Any sign or symptom of a second system of involvement ( presumed reaction ) would be the signal to move into the food anaphylaxis emergency plan, as described above. Realizing that this may add confusion for school personnel, I believe that choosing to use the "food anaphylaxis emergency plan" for ALL food allergic patients would be an appropriate, and perhaps the safest, alternative.</paragraph><paragraph parID="405">As in food-induced anaphylaxis, we need to deliver the message that asthma must be recognized and treated early and that, if prescribed, the SABA should be used before exercise-always. But how do the patient and parent get this accomplished at school? School principal (or his/her designee, as long as the designee clearly represents the administration and has decision-making authority) School nurse Teachers (at least two who are interested in student health issues) School counselor School social worker School psychologist School cafeteria manager Parents of food allergic/asthmatic children (representatives from at least two families) Parents of non-allergic children (representatives from at least two families) PTA/PTO President Allergist Pediatrician Attorney (preferably a parent) At middle and high schools, one allergic/asthmatic and one non-allergic student The school principal can add key members in addition to those listed above Step #1: First responder or patient (if auto-injector is carried) administers epinephrine Step #2: Call 911 Step #3: Inform school principal Step #4: Retrieve individualized anaphylaxis treatment plan and call parents Step #5: Re-administer epinephrine if condition stays the same or worsens Step #6: Possibly administer antihistamine, if available Step #7: Cooperate with emergency medical personnel The food allergic student must be aware of situations to avoid, learn how to identify hidden food allergies, recognize that it is not primarily the responsibility of other students (or even school staff) to avoid allergic foods, and be aware that it is unlikely that other students will make his/her food allergic problem a high priority. When the child is mature enough to recognize that he/she is having a serious allergic reaction and has the skill necessary to self-administer epinephrine, he/she should carry an auto-injector at all times. While individualized anaphylaxis treatment plans at school identify the allergic child and should be part of the planning for food allergy emergencies, they should NOT be retrieved at the moment of crisis if this in any way delays the administration of epinephrine.</paragraph><paragraph parID="406">Once a safety plan is developed and agreed on by the team, it should be followed for all students and only modified based on the team's annual review or the school board's action (not because of one or two demanding parents). Show the school safety plan for food allergic and asthmatic students to parents of allergic children and reassure them that this plan was carefully constructed with input from medical personnel, school staff, and parents. The school also makes sure to keep parents informed and involved. Parent involvement is especially important to Calo, who credits her own success to her father's support and persistence. The school translates everything, including report cards, into Spanish, the language most of the parents speak. It also holds PTA meetings twice, once in the evening and once in the morning, in case parents cannot make it the first time. Castrillo thinks this all contributes to why "families are really committed to have their students comes here."</paragraph><paragraph parID="407">METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS IN EXISTING RESEARCH Despite the validity of some studies, much parent involvement research to date contains serious methodological flaws, which results in a lack of confidence in their findings and limits their accuracy and usefulness. INCONSISTENT DEFINITIONS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT In order to truly understand and document the full impact of parent involvement, studies must separate parent involvement effects from related variables and from the impact of other adults involved in the program by: (1) specifically measuring a parent's involvement (i.e., type and level) separate from other components of the intervention in order to assess its independent impact on the identified outcomes, and (2) evaluating the differential influences of the content of a program and the deliverer (parent or other adult) of the program on outcomes. Drawing on Epstein's (1994) six-item classification system--covering school-home communications, parent involvement in school and community, home learning activities, and parents as decision-makers--might prove useful for developing such a measurement, as it provides a widely accepted typology of parent involvement. LOCATION OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT. AMOUNT OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT.</paragraph><paragraph parID="408">COMPREHENSIVENESS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT. COMPLEXITY OF INVOLVEMENT PATTERNS. ANCILLARY BENEFICIARIES OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT. DIFFERENTIAL GENDER EFFECTS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT. Indeed, the research studies that have done so suggest that the specific aspects of parent involvement considered--parental styles and parenting techniques--have different effects depending upon the gender of the child. With each annual provincial People for Education conference I attend, I have had the opportunity to meet many passionate individuals and parents who have been involved in advocating for children, communities, and public education for many years. From my own experience and from conversations with other parent leaders, the respect parent volunteers deserve is often lacking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="409">Parent involvement is defined as parents as participants whereas parent engagement is defined as parents as partners therefore implies a true partnership between parents and educators in that each takes an equal responsibility for student outcomes. Parent engagement occurs in the relationships of both partners in welcoming and respecting the knowledge and expertise that each brings to the partnership. I have a vision for parents as partners with education in the province of Ontario; I refer to this vision as a new vision of parent engagement and leadership, which is defined by the original concept for parent partnerships in the context of school councils. Today I am a parent engagement advocate because someone took the time to invest in me, saw the potential for partnerships with parents, provided the information relevant to the system of education and encouraged leadership development. Although my children have recently graduated from the public education system (my daughter attends Kings College, UWO and my son has successfully completed a Skilled Trade Apprenticeship), I still see myself as a champion for public education and the role parents have as engaged partners in public education. Original mandates use the language of "accountability" but I think what that often means to parents is being listened to and being reassured by a respectful responsiveness to quesions and concerns. The frustrating thing for me is losing the expertise of veteran leaders.</paragraph><paragraph parID="410">Hoover-Dempsey &amp; Sandler (1995, 1997) identified three critical factors as determinants of parent involvement: (1) parents' role construct (that is, their beliefs about their need to be involved in their child's education), (2) parents' sense of self-efficacy-that they have the knowledge and skills to be involved, and (3) school invitations. Other research has found that cultural and socioeconomic factors strongly influence immigrant families' role construct or perceptions about parental involvement (Carrasquillo &amp; London, 1993; Delgado-Gaitan &amp; Trueba, 1991). Furthermore, these studies suggest that immigrant parents need opportunities to learn about the school system and their roles and rights in their child's education (Chrispeels &amp; Rivero, 2001; Vald&#233;s, 1996). Our study draws from this literature and presents models of factors influencing Latino parent involvement in elementary and secondary schools before and after they participated in a parent education program. Post-program survey data showed that role construct can be influenced by a culturally sensitive education program. A sample of 1,156 parents from 20 California schools was surveyed before and after participating in a 9-week education program offered in the winter of 2002. The surveys included 31 items that assessed seven areas related to parent involvement: (1) home learning activities (e.g., reading to child), (2) parenting practices (e.g., praising child), (3) home-school connections (e.g., attending PTA meetings), (4) parents' knowledge (e.g., knowing academic standards), (5) sense of self-efficacy (e.g., able to help child be successful in school), (6) parental role construction (e.g., parents believe they have to be involved in child's education), and (7) college expectations (e.g., expect child to go to university).</paragraph><paragraph parID="411">The short duration of the program may be one reason for the minimal effect on home-school connections, which did not allow for opportunities for the school or teachers to change their practices and invitations. Knowledge gained in the program is the strongest predictor of Latino parent involvement with their elementary-aged children after participating in the program. The direct path from home-school connections to college expectations may depend on school invitations and may also require a longer time frame for parents to meet with school counselors and attend college prep meetings. This study introduces a new construct: parents' knowledge based on Chrispeels and Rivero's (2001) framework, which has not been extensively explored in the literature as a factor influencing parent involvement. &#185; The parenting program is offered by the Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE), a nonprofit group than began in San Diego, California, in 1987, with the specific purpose of helping Latino and other immigrant parents learn about the American educational system, how to interact schools and teachers, and how to help their children at home. &#178; Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a statistical technique that combines factor analysis, path analysis, and regressions techniques to determine whether a certain model is valid (Kline, 1998). The ADACPP participant group consisted primarily of African-American students in kindergarten through sixth grade, who were identified as latchkey children by the school principal, based on input from the school social worker, the ADACPP prevention site coordinator, and classroom teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="412">Eight itinerant drama artists and eight itinerant substance abuse prevention facilitators were employed. Prevention sites operated five days per week, and functioned from mid-October through late May. Children participated daily for 144 days in two-hour sessions beginning immediately after school consisting of a supervised homework period, self-esteem-building exercises, free play, and, during a seven-week period, creative dramatics. Midway through the visitation period, youth began putting together a dramatic performance eventually performed at the annual Substance Abuse Prevention Student Assembly/Parent Workshop held at each of the 24 prevention sites. The effectiveness of an after-school program for primary grade latchkey students on precursors of substance abuse. Parent Engagement Encouraging Parent Involvement in Schools</paragraph><paragraph parID="413">Parent involvement leads to student success Study after study has shown us that student achievement improves when parents play an active role in their children's education, and that good schools become even better schools when parents are involved. volunteering for field trips and school activities making sure there is a quiet place set aside to do homework, talking to your child about their day at school. These are all examples of engaged parents, they are all contributing to their children's education. To make it easier for parents to get involved, government funding is available to encourage parent involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="414">Parent engagement matters. It is recognized that parent engagement is a key factor in the enhancement of student achievement and well-being. Students are more likely to be motivated, to earn higher grades, to have better behaviour and social skills, and to continue their education to a higher level when their parents are actively engaged in supporting their success at school. For example, the responsibility for spelling review may be turned over completely to the parent. The classroom teacher simply provides the list and handles the testing for purposes of accountability. This role will usually relate to parents with children in grades seven through ten. At the same time, the student is at a dependent age where disciplined study habits must be developed, not by parental force, but through positive encouragement and through the student's growing awareness of personal consequences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="415">At the eleventh and twelfth grade levels the parent's role for the academic courses is usually to guide the student through their at home studies. The parent has the opportunity to monitor the independent schoolwork performed by the student while it is still possible to provide additional guidance if needed. Courses offered by CrossPointe Prep at this level will mimic that of a junior college program where independent study skills and disciplined planning for completing homework assignments are necessary. Some courses (like art, foreign language, music) will involve equipment or expertise that necessitate that teaching be done in the classroom and leave little instruction for the parent at home. This role, therefore, will require the least amount of time by the parent, but its importance must not be understated. last updated:February 2006 We chose this case study because it shows ways some teachers set about enhancing parents' involvement in their children's learning at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="416">The research project took place in 16 schools (primary and secondary) located in inner city and suburban settings in Bristol and Cardiff. The teacher researchers investigated the views of parents, teachers and headteachers about existing home-school practices through parent questionnaires, parent focus groups, and interviews with head teachers, senior staff and class teachers. They used the evidence they collected to inform intervention strategies. Schools Whilst teachers believed home-school partnerships were important, they appeared less clear of the role home played in the partnership. Most communication went only in the direction of from school to home and tended to be in the form of written communication: the kind of information primary teachers asked for from parents was narrow and focused on the school curriculum, for example, how much reading/writing pupils did at home many schools sent a written newsletter out in only one language even though their school catered for pupils from different community backgrounds.</paragraph><paragraph parID="417">Parents Although welcoming this kind of general information about school, parents suggested they would find it helpful to be given more specific and focused information on their individual child or child's class etc and wanted communication to be more frequent and informal. They felt that more regular contact than the traditional open evenings, would stop issues building up and allow information of a different kind to be exchanged. For example, they suggested: 'It would be helpful if we knew more about what they're doing - say on a monthly basis'. 'Having a sheet at the end of each week, briefly noting the areas covered'. As children grew older, communication between home and school appeared to diminish and parents became less sure of their role. Generally, parents regretted that the close links they had enjoyed with the primary school no longer seemed possible with the secondary school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="418">One parent commented: 'I want to stay involved, but I don't know how'. Another wanted 'anything to give me some idea of what's going on'. They devised a variety of interventions that both fostered discussion at home and enhanced parents' knowledge about ways they could help their children with their learning. Photographs A Year 1 teacher in Bristol gave her class disposable cameras to take photographs at home that linked to a science topic on plants and growth. The photographs also showed aspects of family life, for example, pets and visits etc. The photographs were used as a basis for a writing workshop, to which parents and siblings were invited to participate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="419">In another school, Year 4 children were asked to bring photographs to school that recorded mathematical activities they had taken part in during the holidays. Artefacts One teacher asked every child to fill a shoebox with items they thought would motivate their writing. Parents were asked to discuss the children's choices at home. The contents of the boxes were used in a variety of ways, including oral presentations to the class and story writing. Video Videos were used to give parents a view of life in some schools. For example, pupils produced videos for parents, which illustrated methods they had been taught in school to aid mental calculations. In another school, a video of "A Day in the Life of a Year 7" was made and shown to year 6 children and their parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="420">The video acted as a springboard for discussion about their imminent move from primary to secondary school. The teachers valued taking part in the project and some indicated that the interventions had changed their view about the importance of parental involvement at home and how they could encourage it: 'I'm more aware now of what I should be doing, what I could do to help them [parents]'. 'This project has been good because it's given you practical ways [to involve parents]'. Using questionnaire data to find out ways of increasing parental involvement at home secondary schools tended to ask parents to ensure homework was completed and uniform rules were adhered to Reflecting on this evidence led the research teams to consider strategies that might address these concerns.</paragraph><paragraph parID="421">Worry about high stakes testing in school . Children are constantly reminded by both parents and teachers that they must pass certain standardized tests in school or they "won't be able to graduate." Children should be encouraged to do their best on these tests, but they should not worry constantly about them. There are ways to help your children do better on these tests but telling them how important it is to do well is not one of them! What can parents do to help their children? First of all, when you notice your child seems unusually stressed or unhappy, talk to them about it . Use a tone that conveys that you genuinely care about what is happening in their life rather than a, "What is it now?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="422">kind of tone. Children (especially boys) often have trouble expressing their emotions, and helping them to identify their feelings can be helpful. You can ask, "You seem to be worried about something. What's on your mind?" This may open the door for a heart-to-heart conversation about what is stressing your child. Seek help for your child in school . If your child's stress comes primarily from problems in school, call your child's teacher or the school psychologist to request their help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="423">I devleoped a free site called Masterful Kids( www.masterfulkids.com ), which keeps students happy, positive ,goal setters and stress free. There are journals and videos where other students discuss their winning strategies for success and happiness. Teachers viewed ADACPP parents as more concerned than nonparticipant parents before the program began: 45% of the ADACPP parents were very concerned compared to only 26% of non-ADACPP parents. Analysis of covariance was also used and it yielded significant results (in the predicted direction) for the program participants in the 16 schools that included the self-esteem exercise, the Me-Me Drug Prevention Program, but not for the participants in the eight schools that did not include this self-esteem exercise. Each prevention site consisted of a classroom within the school facility that had agreed to house ADACPP, 20 latchkey children from the host school, and a paid staff including a prevention site coordinator, a primary substitute and/or secondary substitute, a parent group coordinator, and a parent advisory council representative. The prevention site coordinators were drawn from the faculty of the host school, which created a link between the school and ADACPP. The researchers abandoned their initial plan of randomly selecting children for participant and nonparticipant groups due to unforeseen complications.</paragraph><paragraph parID="424">Instead, the participant group was chosen based on perceived need and parental cooperation. The parent assessment was re-administered as a posttest approximately four weeks before the end of the school year to parents of students participating in the program as well as to parents who had earlier completed a pretest and whose children did not enroll. The posttest was also sent out to parents whose children dropped out of the program. The percentage of students whose parents reported involvement in their schools rose significantly between 1999 and 2007 across several measures, including attendance at a general meeting, a meeting with a teacher, or a school event, and volunteering or serving on a committee. Thirty-two percent of Hispanic students and 35 percent of black students had parents who volunteered their time, compared with 54 percent of white students. Parents with higher levels of education and income are more likely to be involved in their children's school. Parents of students living in a household above the poverty level are more likely to be involved in school activities than parents of children living in a household at or below the poverty line.</paragraph><paragraph parID="425">Bear Creek pupils could attend the school even if they did not live within the immediate catchment area. In 2007, less than half (41%) of students reported walking or cycling to school. In 2006, the year the Walking School Bus began, only about 25% of children were actively travelling to school. In 2006, two parents at Bear Creek heard about the Walking School Bus and decided it would be a good idea to implement the program at the school Working with the Safe Routes to School administrator for the Boulder Valley School District, Bear Creek initiated a number of active transportation programs and worked with local officials to improve the cycling and walking infrastructure around the school. As part of the Colorado Safe Routes to School program, Bear Creek received funding from the state to implement active transportation initiatives. Parents and the SRTS Administrator collaborated from the start to finish of the grant project. Parents were first informed about the program through material sent home with their children at the end of the school year in 2006.</paragraph><paragraph parID="426">The coordinator said "as parents planned their year, they would determine how their children would get to school, walking or cycling or carpooling, and figure out how to fit it into their daily schedule. Principal Kent Cruger acted as the primary role model for the students when the program initially began. He issued himself a challenge to get to school without a car and, each month, tried a different form of transportation (carpools, a unicycle, scooter and a skateboard among them). (Vivid, Credible Communication; Building Motivation Over Time) Bear Creek's general guideline was that students in kindergarten through second grade went to school with their parents or the group, while students in grades three to five could walk with the bus, by themselves or with friends. Students were keen to be involved and needed little persuasion to get them to walk or cycle to school. Some parents, however, did express concerns: time and safety being among the top ones. Mountain lions in the vicinity are most active at dusk when children were walking home from school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="427">For families that lived very far away, Bear Creek implemented the Ride and Stride program, which encouraged parents to drive part of the way to school then have their children walk the rest. In addition, students participating in the Tour de French (described below) wore colored armbands showing their involvement. Discussing with your child's teacher and parent organizations other ideas for parent involvement. The Norwood Public Schools recognizes that parents/families are their children's first and most influential teachers and that continued parental involvement in the education of children/youth contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive school environment. Three decades of research have shown that parental participation in schooling improves student learning. Such participation of parents and families is critical not only in the very beginning of the educational process, but throughout a child's entire academic career. A child's education is shared by the school and family during the entire period the child spends in school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="428">To support the goal of the school district to educate all students effectively, staff and parents must work as knowledgeable partners. The Norwood Public Schools, in collaboration with parents, shall establish programs and practices that enhance parent involvement and reflect the specific needs of students and their families. To this end, the Norwood Public Schools and the Title I Parent Council supports the development, implementation and regular evaluation of parental involvement in each school and at the district level, which will involve parents at all grade levels in a variety of roles. The parent involvement will be comprehensive and coordinated in nature. Student Learning:    Parents play an integral role in assisting student learning and in working with and supporting the classroom teacher. School Decision Making and Advocacy:    Parents are partners and should contribute to the decisions that affect children and families when appropriate. The Norwood Public Schools supports professional development opportunities for staff members to enhance understanding of effective parent involvement strategies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="429">Child development experts recommend parents start making some adjustments about two weeks before the start of a new school year. Talk to children about going back to school. "Children need to be able to look to their parents and see a parent who is saying, 'You are going to do great!' They can help younger students succeed in school by working on some things at home such as following directions, staying in their seats, listening to the teacher and learning to play well with others. Help your child develop good study skills. Set up a time each evening that is devoted to study and homework. Encourage involvement in school activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="430">SEPARATION OF THE EFFECTS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT FROM THAT OF OTHER INTERVENTION COMPONENTS. While many studies have measured the construct of parent involvement, few have operationalized it the same way. OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENT OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT Studies must use techniques such as direct observation of parental behavior with standardized data collection tools, since self-report data can be unreliable. In general, flaws in existing research fall into four areas: use of non-experimental design, lack of isolation of parent involvement effects, inconsistent definitions of parent involvement, and non-objective measures of parent involvement. Many of the field studies examining the impact of parent involvement on children's achievement employ non-experimental designs which are too weak to allow for confidence in their findings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="431">These designs--as compared to true experiments--do not contain the controls necessary for researchers to conclude that parent involvement is the cause of enhanced student performance. LACK OF ISOLATION OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT EFFECTS Future parent involvement studies must overcome the methodological limitations identified above in order to increase their accuracy and utility. Parents described teaching skills of good teacher/coaches as the ability to: know how to sequence learning; give feedback, and provide adequate wait time (defined as a delay in feedback allowing the student-athlete opportunity to respond or self-correct) Some of those specific goals were:</paragraph><paragraph parID="432">Finally, the third largest category of parent comment was "fun" or the player's enjoyment of the total sport experience. Of the twenty-two comments regarding athletes having "fun", 14 of the comments echoed one theme, "They [athletes] look forward to practice and play". The practical implications of this study are many. For instance, the majority of qualitative data from this study clarified parents' desire for coaches to communicate openly with the athletes and parents regarding a variety of issues. These were three very different parental interpretations of fairness as it relates to playing time. There are additional implications of this study for sport administrators (directors of coaches and athletic directors).</paragraph><paragraph parID="433">At the very least, this may mean that the coaching candidates have played the sport. On the contrary, one of the parents' highest priority characteristics, ability to teach well, is not always a skill found in people who have only played the sport. Unless non-teacher coaching candidates have completed a formal coaching education program, they may have little understanding of teaching methods. In this study, parents described the ability to teach well as more than knowing the techniques and tactics (X's and O's) of the game. sequencing of tasks, organization of practices, providing appropriate feedback,</paragraph><paragraph parID="434">as aspects of the coach's ability to teach well. In an attempt to hire quality coaches, sport administrators should screen candidates for those who possess the coaching characteristics ranked the highest by parents; As the preferences and desires of parents of athletes are determined and articulated, more should be done to improve communication and involve parents in the process of building better athletic programs. These parental responses confirmed the potential for an incongruity between parent and coaches' expectations in regards to fair and honest behavior, commitment to having fun and the ability to teach well. Ask a group of coaches what the most challenging part of their job is, and they will probably state, "parents". Many young coaches are shocked at how much time they spend dealing with parents. The relationships coaches have with the parents of their athletes can be either helpful and supportive, or stressful and frustrating.</paragraph><paragraph parID="435">Hooper and Jefferies (1990) described a healthy parent/coach relationship in terms of an "athletic triangle" involving the coach, the athlete, and the parents. By appropriately including parents in the triangle, and thus involving them in the sports program in a positive manner, coaches can improve not only the relationship with parents, but also improve the experience of the athletes. The purpose of this study was to determine parental preferences of coaches of their children, and additionally, have parents articulate how they measured those characteristics. The research was a continuation of Stewart's (1994) survey of parents of high school athletes where he hypothesized that if coaches were better aware of the characteristics parents valued, then that understanding could foster a stronger parent/coach relationship. A second goal was an informal comparison of parent values from previous work. If indeed parents prioritized coaching characteristics differently than ten years ago, coaches could use this information to improve an ever-evolving parent/coach relationship. Finally, these results could aid coach educators in their efforts to prepare future coaches to better communicate and maintain healthy relationships with parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="436">The authors further recognized that while there were other important factors that influenced talent development, a family setting that provided the child with enough security that he/she was both cheerful and energetic, but concurrently offered enough meaningful challenges to develop goal directed behaviors, increased the chances of refining talent. C&#244;t&#233; and Hay (2002) applied the work of Csikszentmihalyi, et al (1993) by observing that the complex family is the most effective family environment for young athletes. Furthermore, the complex family is compatible with the authoritative (not authoritarian) parenting style that establishes clear objectives for responsible behavior. An authoritative parent uses reason, power, and reinforcement to assist children in achieving objectives. In addition, C&#244;t&#233; and Hay (2002) cited the work of Hellstedt (1987) who surmised that parental involvement in their child's sport ranges from under-involved, to moderately (appropriately) involved, to over-involved. The level of parental involvement heavily influences the type of relationship that exist between coach, parent, and athlete. The under-involved parents isolate themselves away from the sport.</paragraph><paragraph parID="437">In doing so, that behavior often increases the burden on the coach-athlete relationship. Players, who do not have parental support by even limited involvement, rarely are totally committed to a program. Conversely, the moderately, thus appropriately, involved parent constructs a positive triangular relationship with the coach and young athlete. On the other extreme, the over-involved parent creates a negative situation in one of two ways. This knowledge can assist coaches in understanding what type of relation they can expect to have with certain types of parents. Unfortunately, few theoretical models exist in the area of parent/coach relationships. However, some researchers (Martin, Dale, &amp; Jackson, 2001; Stewart, 1997; Stewart, 1994) have examined the coaching characteristics most preferred by parents and players.</paragraph><paragraph parID="438">Understanding parental expectations is the first step to successful parent-coach communication. Stewart (1994) based his original work on the premise that coaches must first understand what parents expect in a coach. In that earlier work, Stewart (1994) surveyed the parents of high school athletes and found that they most desired coaches who were: In fact, high school parents ranked these more traditional characteristics last: Stewart (1997) later hypothesized that as athletes began playing at a higher level, their parents' expectations would probably change. With that premise, parents of Olympic Development soccer players at both the State and Regional levels were given the same survey from the 1994 study. The three most important characteristics picked by parents of Olympic Development players varied only slightly from the parents of high school athletes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="439">Olympic Development parents preferred coaches who: Stewart (1997) also found a slight discrepancy between parents' reported preferences and what coaches thought parents would prefer. Parents valued sportsmanship more and playing at a higher level less than coaches thought they would (Stewart, 1997). Similarly, Martin, Dale, and Jackson (2001) completed a study of parents of young players aged ten to eighteen years. In the study, they used a modified Participation Motivation Questionnaire to compare the preferences of parents to their young athletes'. In comparing Stewart's (1994 &amp; 1997) and Martin's (2001) studies, it appeared that parents' preferences were changing. Similarly, Rich (1998) provided suggestions for teachers in their interactions with parents:</paragraph><paragraph parID="440">making expectations for learning clear to parents and children and sharing learning goals with parents make their training and team expectations clear to parents and athletes and share them with the parents This, too, emphasizes the importance of the teacher/coach and parent having the same understanding of goals and expectations. Likewise, Giannetti and Sagarese (1998) gave similar advice to middle school teachers dealing with critical parents. They stated that by conveying shared values with parents, a teacher would foster greater acceptance and communication.</paragraph><paragraph parID="441">Reassuring parents that the adults in the athletic program value similar coaching characteristics can put them at ease and turn a potential challenger into a supportive ally. There is no doubt that coaching is an inherently stressful job and much of the stress comes from parents. However, taking time to understand parental expectations of coaches and then working towards open communication can relieve much of that tension. The participants in this study were parents of soccer and volleyball clubs in Montana. Parents were sent (via email or postcard) a request to participate in an on-line survey regarding "good coaches". The web address of the survey was included and both parents were encouraged to complete the survey. Of the 160 parents asked to complete the survey, 56 responded.</paragraph><paragraph parID="442">Parents provided their age, if they had participated in sports in their youth, and if so their highest level (elementary, junior high, high school, college, professional) of participation (Table 1). The parents were asked to report the number of children in their family, child's age and gender, and highest level of sports participation for each child. Table 1 - Basic Demographics of Parent Respondents (n=56) Highest Level Played (Parent) A final, open-ended question requested that parents select their top coaching characteristic and write one to three coaching behaviors that was indicative of that feature. Table 2 - Parental Preferences in Coaching Characteristics (from Most Preferred to Least) A brief explanation of the survey and its WEB address was sent to one hundred sixty (160) parents and fifty-six (56) completed it representing 135 children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="443">Parents ranged from 36-62 years of age. Of those parents, twenty-three (23) were males and thirty-three (33) were females. A majority of parents reported participating in sport at a variety of competitive levels. The highest levels of play reached by parents are reported in Table 1. Finally, parents were asked to describe behaviors that they felt were indicative of their highest priority of coaching characteristic. Class volunteers (teachers, parents, siblings) approved by each school also assisted site coordinators and substitutes in various activities. Funding Level</paragraph><paragraph parID="444">Funding Sources Three main hypotheses of possible risk factors were explored in the evaluation: Depression - Latchkey children may be at great risk of substance use because time spent alone places them at greater risk of becoming depressed, which, in turn, may put them at risk of using drugs to relieve their depression. Lack of supervision - Latchkey children may be at greater risk of substance use because the time they spend alone allows for a greater number of unsupervised trials of high-risk behavior of all types, including alcohol and other drug use. Along with these substance abuse risk factors, the evaluation explored the effectiveness of the intervention at improving academic performance. The ADEPT Drug and Alcohol Community Prevention Project (ADACPP) is a primary-level alcohol and other drug-use prevention program that provided after school child care services to 24 different low-income area elementary schools of the New Orleans Public School District during 144 days of the school year. The youth were then solicited by mailing an invitation to the parents which described ADACPP, offered the services to the family, and requested that interested parents or designated adults attend a Parent Orientation Meeting held at each site.</paragraph><paragraph parID="445">Field trips occurred during ADACPP after school hours and were only undertaken at a given prevention site if there was participation by 50% of ADACPP parents. The number of participants in the study fluctuated due to dropouts, late entries, and parents not returning the assessment. Two primary sources served as the basis of both the parent and teacher reports of student classroom behavior and adjustment: the Teacher-Child Rating Scale (T-CRS) developed by Cowen, Hightower, Work et al. (1986) and the Achenbach Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach &amp;amp; Edelbrock, 1981). The parent assessment consisted of 25 general information questions about their children concerning: the extent to which their child was latchkey, parent-child involvement, parental expectations, etc. The teacher assessment included eight general questions concerning homework completion, academic potential, the degree to which parents were concerned about their child's school performance, etc. Behavioral problems and competencies reported by parents of normal and disturbed children aged four through sixteen. According to a 2009 study by A.J. Cherlin, by the mid 1990s, 12 percent of American children had experienced three or more parental partnerships by 15 years of age.</paragraph><paragraph parID="446">Within developmental psychology, a large body of research heralds the importance of continuity and predictability in the parent-child relationship during early childhood. The instability resulting from these demographic trends are likely to disrupt parenting behaviors and school involvement that supports children's early academic achievement. Toward that end, a host of early education and intervention strategies have been implemented to improve the school readiness skills of children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Together, these demographic trends have resulted in an increased number of children whose parents have had multiple partners in relatively short periods of time. These programs have achieved mixed success, but in general, low-income children continue to start school significantly behind their more affluent peers in emergent literacy and numeracy skills and make less progress throughout the elementary school years. For the past several years, Heather Bachman, assistant professor in the School of Education's Applied Developmental Psychology (ADP) program, and Elizabeth Votruba-Drzal, assistant professor in the Department of Psychology, have been examining socioeconomic status (SES) effects on children's achievement trajectories during elementary school. According to several national data sets, the impact of significant family income and maternal education disparities on children's reading and math skills is evident in kindergarten and persists or widens through fifth grade.</paragraph><paragraph parID="447">Throughout their study, Bachman and Votruba-Drzal, along with ADP doctoral candidate Nermeen El Nokali, endeavored to determine whether parents' involvement in school could narrow these achievement gaps. The consensus among teachers, childcare providers, educational policy makers, and researchers is that parent involvement is a pathway through which schools can help children to achieve academic success. The most common measures of parent involvement are quality and frequency of communication with teachers and parental participation in school activities. Efforts to promote parent involvement are integral parts of many intervention programs targeting low-income children. Past research, however, has focused mostly on parent involvement among preschoolers, while far less is known about the role of parent involvement in children's success during elementary school. Moreover, few studies have examined whether promoting increased parent involvement in school leads to corresponding improvement in children's academic or social functioning. In other words, perhaps parents who are engaged and involved in children's schooling differ from less involved parents in key characteristics that are also associated with children's academic and social skills, such as motivation, value for education, etc?</paragraph><paragraph parID="448">If so, then parent involvement is simply a marker for a host of parental attitudes and behaviors that already support children's growth and development. This attempt to distinguish causal from correlation associations between family involvement and children's school success is critical as teachers and principals become increasingly accountable for their efforts to encourage parent and community involvement in schooling. Bachman and Votruba-Drzal obtained data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Childcare and Youth Development, a longitudinal, multimethod study of more than 1,300 children and their primary caregivers from 10 U.S. cities. According to the findings, when parents boosted their involvement in their children's elementary school (through increased visits to the school and encouraging educational progress at home), children's problem behaviors (including both aggressive and disruptive behaviors as well as anxiety and depression) decreased. At the same time, their prosocial skills (such as cooperation and self-control) improved. However, parents' increased involvement did not affect their children's growth in achievement. One explanation for the absence of such associations with achievement may be that the study's measure of parent involvement did not focus on involvement that was specific to academic performance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="449">This work suggests that parents continue to wield considerable influence on their children's development as children progress through elementary school, and these results applied similarly to low-income and high-income children. It is important for future research to explore parent behaviors that support children's achievement and also to consider how schools can encourage and support parents in these efforts.

Research Background Parent involvement has been repeatedly identified as a protective factor for young, low-income children's positive development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="450">Epstein and her colleagues (1996) have proposed a framework of parent involvement that includes six main types of activities that connect families, schools, and communities. While numerous studies have used Epstein's framework to examine relationships between components of parent involvement and important child outcomes, they have yielded inconsistent results. These mixed findings are most likely explained by research designs that discount the richness of parent involvement by using single or small sets of survey items to measure this multidimensional construct. In addition, parent involvement research has tended to focus on heterogeneous groups of children, hindering our understanding of the differential efficacy of involvement activities across different stages of development and for culturally diverse groups of children. A recent study by Fantuzzo and colleagues identified a multidimensional construct of parent involvement with a preschool Head Start sample (Fantuzzo, Tighe, McWayne, Davis, &amp; Childs, 2002). The Parent Involvement in Children's Education Scale (PICES) is a 40-item parent report instrument that provides information on the frequency of specific involvement behaviors across three dimensions: Supportive home learning environment - parent behaviors that promote learning at home, such as spending time with children talking about school activities</paragraph><paragraph parID="451">Direct school contact - parents' direct involvement in school-based activities and direct communications with school personnel Inhibited involvement - barriers to parents' involvement in their children's education, such as time constraints The purpose of this study was to identify a multidimensional picture of parent involvement in kindergarten, and to determine whether parent involvement dimensions in an ethnic minority, low-income kindergarten sample are congruent with those identified in a demographically similar preschool sample. Research Methods Three hundred seven ethnic minority kindergarten children and their caregivers recruited from seven urban public schools in the Northeast participated in this study. Of these families, 95% were African American, 4% were Asian American, and 1% identified as Latino or "other." Boys and girls were represented equally, all came from low-income families, and most had attended preschool (72%), specifically Head Start (61%).</paragraph><paragraph parID="452">A number of teacher and parent measures were used in order to examine parent involvement and kindergarten children's social and academic competencies. Parents reported on their involvement using the Parent Involvement in Children's Education Scale (PICES) (Fantuzzo et al., 2002), as well as on their children's peer play competencies (PIPPS) (Fantuzzo &amp; Hampton, 2000) and broader social skills and problems (SSRS) (Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990). Teachers also reported on children's social skills and problem behaviors, peer play competencies, and academic success (Academic Subscale of the teacher SSRS). Two sets of analyses were conducted: (1) an assessment of the generalization of PICES dimensions across a kindergarten sample, and (2) an investigation of the relationships between family involvement (PICES) dimensions and kindergarten children's outcomes. Through our analyses, we identified reliable dimensions of family involvement for this kindergarten sample identical to those found with a demographically similar population of Head Start preschool children: supportive home learning environment, direct school contact, and inhibited involvement. Additional analyses indicated that these three dimensions related significantly to children's academic and social functioning at both home and school. Research Findings</paragraph><paragraph parID="453">Findings highlighted two distinct patterns of parent involvement for families of kindergarten children. First, involved parents were characterized as providing a rich learning environment at home with activities, including talking with their child about the importance of school and helping them practice what they are learning in school. Children of these involved parents evidenced high levels of social skills and were observed to be more cooperative, self-controlled, and prosocially engaged in both home and school environments. Additionally, the academic functioning of children with more involved parents was rated as higher than the functioning of children with less involved parents, as evidenced by greater academic motivation as well as achievement in reading and mathematics. A second pattern of relationships emerged from this study with parents who reported being "disconnected" from the educational learning experiences of their child. Specifically, low levels of direct school contact and increased inhibited involvement were related to children's externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors in school. These parents reported more barriers, such as increased familial stress and work responsibilities, that often precluded their involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="454">In summary, results using this multidimensional assessment tool suggest that parents who actively promote learning in the home, have direct and regular contact with school, and experience fewer barriers to involvement have children who demonstrate positive engagement with their peers, adults, and learning. Findings from this study have several implications for early childhood educators and programs. Family involvement has become a greater challenge in recent years as the characteristics of families are changing. Now more than ever, mothers constitute a significant portion of the workforce, and many low-income children are living in single, female-headed households (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). Demographic changes, and the discontinuity that often exists between home and school environments for young, minority low-income children, underscore the need for culturally sensitive methods for understanding and encouraging parental involvement (Slaughter-Defoe &amp; Brown, 1998). The significant impact of home-based involvement on child outcomes in this study highlights the need to stimulate educational involvement and support at home. , Family school links: How do they affect educational outcomes?</paragraph><paragraph parID="455">WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT? There are many advantages when parents play an active role in the educational process. Children spend much more time at home than at school. Their parents know them intimately, interact with them one-to-one, and do not expect to be paid to help their children succeed. The home environment, more familiar and less structured than the classroom, offers what Dorothy Rich (1985) calls "'teachable moments' that teachers can only dream about." Children whose parents are involved in their formal education have many advantages. They have better grades, test scores, long-term academic achievement, attitudes, and behavior than those with disinterested mothers and fathers (Anne T. Henderson 1988).</paragraph><paragraph parID="456">Many studies underscore the point: parent participation in education is very closely related to student achievement. A Stanford study found that using parents as tutors brought significant and immediate changes in children's I.Q. scores. Other research projects found that community involvement correlated strongly with schoolwide achievement and that all forms of parent involvement helped student achievement. The Home and School Institute concluded that parent tutoring brought substantial improvements to a wide variety of students (Rich). Family and school benefit when they cooperate. Children feel that these two institutions--by far the most important in their lives--overlap and are integrated. Parents who help their children succeed academically gain a sense of pride in their children and themselves.</paragraph><paragraph parID="457">Such parents are strong advocates for the district. WHAT CAN PARENTS DO TO IMPROVE THEIR CHILDREN'S PERFORMANCE? Tutoring is probably the best way for parents to participate in public education, according to Rich. Intensive, one-to-one teaching is highly effective, and, unlike meetings, it does not take parents away from their children and their home. WHAT ARE THE SPECIAL CHALLENGES FOR INVOLVING THE PARENTS OF AT-RISK CHILDREN? They contacted seventy-five parents, ten of whom completed the five-class program. Their children's attendance, grades, and behavior improved noticeably.</paragraph><paragraph parID="458">Some parents are too distrustful of schools to help them educate their children. Empathy is critical in any program for disadvantaged parents. Simply asking or requiring teachers to schedule some of their parent conferences in the evening can make a big difference. Administrators can also alert parents to home education's advantages. The Indianapolis Public Schools, for example, widely publicizes its teacher-parent conferences to encourage participation (National School Boards Association 1988). This continuous loop of obsessions and compulsions may be relentless and, while all this is going on, it's just about impossible to feel -- or even act -- "normal." For example, instead of hearing the teacher describe how to solve a particular kind of math problem, a student with OCD may only hear the inner voice of OCD.</paragraph><paragraph parID="459">In the case of OCD, the disorder may be so insidious (and so insistent) that the child will most likely be "tuned in" to the OCD instead of the teacher or the class work. Researchers found that almost 90% of the parents and children surveyed reported a significant problem in at least one of the domains; almost half of the parents and children reported at least one substantial problem in all three domains. Interestingly, the two most common problems reported by these young people and their parents -- across all three domains -- were concentrating on work and completing homework. The results of this research confirmed the results of the U.S. study: parent and child reports showed that the majority of children and adolescents with OCD experienced significant impairment -- especially in the home/family domain, but also in the school and social domains. Intriguingly, within the school domain, the top two concerns reported by parents and students alike were identical to those reported in the U.S. study: doing homework and concentrating on work. As the anxiety is building, the student is focusing only on that feeling, not on learning. When they leave the classroom to carry out rituals (e.g., going to the bathroom to perform washing rituals), they may miss out on potentially important academic information.</paragraph><paragraph parID="460">They may miss out on important instruction when tardiness and school absenteeism became a problem due to OCD symptoms (e.g., carrying out washing, dressing, eating rituals before school; not attending school because of triggers on that environment). Gaps in instruction, in turn, may lead to serious academic problems; when they miss instruction in important skills, they are likely to have difficulty learning concepts and new information built upon those skills. Understandably, avoiding certain tasks related to reading (e.g., the student avoids reading any material that is written or highlighted in red because of an association with blood), writing (the student cannot write cursive letters that contain loops, such as an uppercase "J," because of a fear that a loved one may get "trapped" in the loop), or math (e.g., the student cannot do problems that contain a "6," because 6 is associated with evil) can have serious negative effects on learning. This is why it's critical that educators take a proactive approach to becoming aware of what OCD is, and to alert parents when any potential signs of OCD are observed at school. The research suggested that Greenest City would face several key barriers when presenting the ASRTS program to parents and schools. Many parents would not allow their children to walk in cold or wet weather conditions. Also, perceptions of time limited pedestrian travel because parents believed that walking consumed a much longer period of time than driving.</paragraph><paragraph parID="461">General Implementation In the fall of 1996, Greenest City of Toronto responded to a growing concern for the health and safety of elementary students by introducing the Active and Safe Routes to School program in parent meetings and through information displays at school events. The Walking School Bus (WSB) The Walking School Bus (WSB) component of the program involved elementary students traveling to and from school by foot and under the supervision of parents or trusted neighbours. Instead, their parents were encouraged to park in a legal and safe space within walking distance of the school and then walk the remaining distance to and from school with their children. Similarly, the Walking School Bus to the Bus allowed parents to share the load of supervising their children as they traveled to a designated waiting area along a city bus route. Parents were encouraged to educate their children in bicycle safety and to accompany them on their bike rides to school. The program included student banners reminding parents to turn off their engines when parked near a school or a campaign ( Prompts ). Greenest Citys ASRTS Resource Guide has suggested several items (adapted from the Parent Safety Patrol Information Package, Whitby Community Police Office) that need to be considered when conducting a Neighbourhood Walkabout:</paragraph><paragraph parID="462">Block Parent or Neighbourhood Watch communityApparently "children were begging their parents to walk them to school instead of driving."Based on the findings of Allenby Public Schools Safety Committee (made up of concerned parents), the following changes were made:And in articles in Time magazine, Today's Parent, Canadian Living, The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, LExpress, Alternatives, and many community newspapers.She is characteristically unreasonable, unapproachable, unrelenting and sometimes, even incompetent.In fact, a 2004 study by Nye, Konstantanopoulos and Hedges found that when it comes to how much your child learns in a school year, the teacher your child gets is much more important than the school he or she attends.</paragraph></documents>
