    <paragraph parID="0">Whilst the majority of children go to school to gain an education and be taught, an alternative option that some people chose is to home school their children. Their parents choose to opt for homeschooling for a number of reasons - it could be that they're not happy with the schools in their area, that their children wasn't happy at school, that their child has a disability or learning problem that they feel they could handle better if educated at home, or that they simply feel their child would benefit from a more individual form of education. Children can benefit from getting more attention to their own learning when they're taught alone, or in small groups (some homeschooling families join together for learning). There's more opportunity with homeschooling to focus and develop a child's special interests. They're also much more about to work at their own pace. If children have experienced problems at school, for example by being bullied, their learning often takes off when they're removed from a school environment. There's more flexibility with learning and the subjects being studied.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">Lessons can take place at home, in the garden, outside or on trips and there's more flexibility and scope than just being in a classroom. Not having to stick to the exact timings of the school day can work well, although it's good to stick to routines for the most part. Being at home doesn't mean children can't take GCSE exams - there are many options open to homeschoolers (e.g. doing them via distance learning education providers or through a local college) and one benefit is that they may well be able to do exams at an earlier stage than if at school. Realistically, it's a lot of work for parents and takes a huge amount of dedication and it can be exhausting to do all the lesson planning and instigating themselves. It's also hard work coming up with new and interesting ideas to teach children. Some families find it's actually a bit too much to be together all the time. Homeschooling can put a strain on finances, as it means one parent has to be at home to teach the kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">Homeschooling isn't something to go into lightly, especially as there's a lot of work involved in being with and teaching your children each day. Whilst education is compulsory, it's not illegal to provide that education at home, instead of in a school. Unless you organise set times to go out and take part in other activities and clubs, you can go a bit potty! Homeschooling does mean that children may miss out on some vital socialising (one reason why it's vital they're involved in non-education activities, groups and clubs too). But many people do successfully teach their own children and if you do your homework and are certain that homeschooling is right for you, then good luck! Public education in many places is so bad it can't be fixed. We looked at Montessori school and really like some of the ones in our area that have the language immersion programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">my wife taught a montessori based sunday school program for a few years and really likes the concept. My daughter loves it and they go outside every day no matter what the weather is. They really push creativity and self development. Now my daughter is only in preschool but my biggest concern at her age was paying for a glorified babysitting service. I like how they have several age groups in one setting to give a greater diversity in learning with peers at different stages. I was a little hesitant(mostly because lack of knowledge) at first, but my wife really liked the school so I visited and saw the setup. she loved how the montessori system engaged the kids (she taught the 3-6 year olds)</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">the Montessori method is so popular. Some of the reasons it was not right for my child include: emphasis on individual work and lack of opportunities for children to work and play together, lack of emphasis and opportunity for children to be creative and use their imaginations (they can decide which materials to use and for how long, but the materials have a ''right'' way, like a puzzle, rather than providing any opportunity for experimentation and creativity). They have a very caring staff and nice kids and parents. Children may be enrolled full or part-time with varying scheduline options available starting at age 2. Re: Montessori Schools in Alameda I am an Alameda parent who sent my then-pre-schooler to 2 different Montessori schools and was disappointed (to a greater or lesser extent) both times. As an educated professional, I was not concerned about my child's academic preparation for kindergarten, and believe that in preschool it is more important for children to learn social and emotional skills. I am really baffled as to why!</paragraph><paragraph parID="5">I believe that this method is only appropriate for a small percentage of children, yet it seems to be the main option available. I also did not think that the focus on academics at the expense of play and fun was appropriate, and threatened to squelch my daughter's joy in learning. I will definitely not be sending my outgoing, social, imaginative, and fun-loving second child to a Montessori school. not a Montessori fan We enjoyed our tours of both but they have very different characteristics. Another principle of Dr Montessori's beliefs was that children need to be given more freedom to learn. She believed that children shouldn't be pushed to complete activities in certain set times and that should do it in their own time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="6">However, this doesn't mean complete freedom with no rules, but rather within appropriate guidelines and as part of a social group. She also believed that children should have a choice about what activities they try and that should try and learn to be self-sufficient. Although some forms of early education tend to split children into different groups according to their age, under the Montessori approach, there is the belief that it's good to have mixed age groups. Rather than hindering a child's progress, it's believed that it will help all of the children to develop on a social and intellectual basis, at their pace which is best for them. Nurseries are typically highly supportive, with children learning and working together, and support children with a variety of needs. The types of activities enjoyed by children are very similar to that of other nurseries, but the time at nursery may be split up differently, with more time available to concentrate on activities. In fact, despite operating to a slightly different approach than other schools, children from Montessori schools often thrive on the approach and have a very high standard of academic achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">The Montessori environment is a non-competitive, self-paced learning system that offers a superior educational program. I truly believe that Montessori is the most brilliant teaching method ever used. Our school was built on three levels and each classroom community is a carefully prepared environment with a complete set of Montessori materials necessary for an authentic Montessori education. A part-time program is available. The Montessori teacher observes the child's progress with the materials and through observation, determines when the next lesson that should be given.

Our Programs</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">The Montessori Method was developed by Italian educator, Dr. Maria Montessori, in the early twentieth century. It is built upon the idea that children develop and think differently than adults, and that they are competent beings, capable of self-directed learning. We combine proven methods with the nurturing your child needs to discover and grow. Employing a vast selection of genuine Montessori materials that are practically irresistible, they help guide children along the path of true discovery. Our special, proven approach can help your child enhance independence, inspiration and intelligence. Toddler Program: Montessori of Las Colinas has four toddler rooms - two for children ages 13 months (and walking) to 24 months, and two for children 24-36 months. The classrooms offer an excellent ratio of child to teacher, so families can be confident that students are receiving personalized care.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">Our toddlers work and play in a loving environment that allows them to experience practical life exercises all day long. Primary Program: The children in the Primary Montessori classrooms work in a multi-aged learning environment. Each classroom has an area for practical life, sensorial, math, language, science, geography and art. The lessons are given individually and the child is then left to work independently. Part-time programs are available. Feedback and qualitative analysis of a child's performance does exist but is usually provided in the form of a list of skills, activities and critical points, and sometimes a narrative of the child's achievements, strengths and weaknesses, with emphasis of the improvement of those weaknesses. Networked learning - A process of developing and maintaining connections with people and information, and communicating in such a way so as to support one another's learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">Unit Study - It is defined as an in-depth study of a topic (space, trees, cars, etc.) that takes into account many areas of the topic, such as geography, science, history, art, etc. It is a complete immersion into the topic so that the student will see things as a "whole" instead of bits and pieces learned throughout their education. Unschooling - unschoolers believe that the use of standard curricula and conventional grading methods, as well as other features of traditional schooling, are counterproductive to the goal of maximizing the education of each child. too religious or not religious enough. too demanding or not rigorous enough. moving too quickly or too slowly for their child. unsafe or too confining.</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">too intrusive or too unresponsive. Crossing a range or mixture of specialities. Selecting a mixture of what appear to be best of various doctrines, methods, or styles. Montessori - The Montessori philosophy is built upon the idea that children develop and think differently from adults; that they are not merely "adults in small bodies". Dr. Montessori advocated children's rights, children working to develop themselves into adults, and that these developments would lead to world peace. The Montessori method discourages traditional measurements of achievement (grades, tests) under the premise that it is damaging to the inner growth of children (and adults). The centerpiece of the Montessori approach is allowing children to learn on their own while being guided by the teacher.</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">Montessori teachers do not correct work and hand it back with lots of red marks. A child's work is not graded. The teacher assesses what the child has learned and then guides him into new areas of discovery. "The Montessori School's culture is devoted to helping each child grow toward independence by building confidence, competence, self-esteem and respect for others. More than an approach to education, Montessori is an approach to life. The School respects children as self-directed individuals and fosters their growth toward independence and social responsibility, while creating a joyful, diverse and family-oriented community. Montessori classrooms are designed in a multi-age mix from toddlers through adolescents which allows for both individual and social development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">Most lessons are given to small groups or individual children while other children are working independently. The school uses stories, Montessori materials, charts, time lines, objects of nature, treasures from the wealth of cultures around the worlds and sometime conventional tools to teach the children. The school believes in sharing what we have with those in need and encouraging children to learn to live responsibly in the world. At The Montessori School, students are inspired to live both passionately and compassionately in a global community." Since the name Montessori is not protected by any copyright, Montessori in the name of a school does not necessarily mean that it adheres to the Montessori philosophy of education . The program at The Montessori School, both in philosophy and pedagogy, is based on the scientific research work of Dr. Maria Montessori and on AMI Montessori training. The classrooms are beautiful by design.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">They are set up in an open style, with work areas throughout the room and materials available on accessible shelving. Guided by the teacher, Montessori students actively participate in planning their time and taking responsibility for their work. Committed to diversity, The Montessori School community is inclusive and depends on the tenets of respect. One of the differences between Dr. Montessori's approach to early childhood education and the approach found in many primary schools is the adoption of elements of the multiple intelligences theory. Yet all too often we send our children who have been taught to use all their intelligences off to schools where they are severely restricted in what they learn and how they learn it. If multiple intelligences are important to your child rearing philosophy, then Montessori and Waldorf schools are worth a look. The name Montessori is not legally protected, and can be used by anyone, for any purpose.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">"Montessori educational practice helps children develop creativity, problem solving, social, and time-management skills, to contribute to society and the environment, and to become fulfilled persons in their particular time and place on Earth. The basis of Montessori practice in the classroom is respected individual choice of research and work, and uninterrupted concentration rather than group lessons led by an adult." Montessori is often seen as "the solution" to gifted education, and it may be... but it may or may not be. A gifted-friendly Montessori classroom would allow above-grade-level work in any subject, bringing in materials from the next level. Passionate, well-educated teachers. Ability grouping for all subjects, beginning at the earliest grades. Low student to teacher ratio.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">Very low tolerance (not zero-tolerance) for bullying and mean-spirited behavior towards and from students and teachers. Parent participation is welcomed, wherever school need or parent expertise exists. Field trips and enrichment opportunities are available for ALL children. Well-rounded curriculum, including major subjects, computers, art, music, sports, and community service. Rigorous curriculum is offered, with limited use of calculators before pre-calculus math, and limited use of learning groups in all subjects. Learning styles are taken into consideration. Little or no "teaching to the test" occurs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">All children have the opportunity to learn to deal with challenge in their early years of schooling. At the middle school level, rigorous curriculum is offered, including leveled classes in all major subjects, with differentiated curriculum at each level. At the high school level, Honors and AP courses are offered in a variety of subjects, which differ significantly from the regular and remedial courses also offered. Excellent facilities, including grounds, physical building, science labs, photography labs, fine arts workshops, performing arts theatre, and especially, well-stocked and comfortable library Lots of clubs and extracurricular activities for kids to explore new subjects, learn new things, meet new people, and shine Multiple grades, as many as possible. K-12 would be best, so that flexibility in classroom placement would encompass all grades.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">It would allow the child to move up to new levels of the school, as the child needs (usually called Assistants to Infancy (ages 0-3), Primary (ages 3-6), Elementary (ages 6-9 and 9-12), and Middle school (ages 12-14). Lakeland Montessori's Board of Directors is a collection of concerned parents, educators, and community members that are committed to developing, implementing and continuing a long-term educational Montessori choice option in Polk County. Each member brings individual abilities and skills to aid in the development of our school. The main concern in selecting members is to ensure that the group consists of not only educators, nor only parents, but a well-rounded range of members that can each bring their expertise together as a team to ensure that a Montessori education is available in our community. These expertise fields include such areas as law, education, real estate, international marketing, former experience on a board, economics and the ability to communicate our vision well to the community. Harlan Crosswait serves as the Chairman and President of our Board of Directors. Mr. Crosswait has owned and operated Florida Financial &amp;amp; Insurance Services in Lakeland, FL for many years and has an extensive marketing background that aids Lakeland Montessori in communicating its vision to the community, and in creating awareness of our program to parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">His financial and administration experience aid in the School's accountability in the financial areas. The academic education and community involvement of Mr. Crosswait's children and grandchildren were and continue to be an important concern to him. One evidence of this is his son's graduation from MIT with a doctorate degree in nuclear engineering and his service to the military and Senate of the United States. Mr. Crosswait's grandson has also graduated from Lakeland Montessori. Tamika Plymill also serves on the Board of Directors. Ms. Plymill is a life-time resident of Lakeland and works at Publix Super Markets in banking. She has acquired many administrative and drafting design skills which are useful in operation of Lakeland Montessori.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">In addition, as an African American business member of the Lakeland community, she is highly interested in contributing to our school culture by helping to ensure that our School is racially, ethnically, and culturally balanced and diverse. Ms. Plymill's daughters also attended Lakeland Montesssori. Louree Vailoces serves on our Board of Directors as well as having two daughters enrolled and one that has graduated from Lakeland Montessori. Mrs. Vailoces is a Physician and received her M.D. from the University of the East Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Medical Center. Mrs. Vailoces is the co-founder of the Bristol Integrated School providing her with both business and educational expertise that aid in the continued success of Lakeland Montessori Schoolhouse. Lori DeAngelis serves as the Secretary on the Board of Directors as well as having her two sons enrolled. Mrs. DeAngelis is an Attorney for Publix Super Markets and received her Juris Doctor from Western New England College, School of Law.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">She also received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from the University of Conneticut. Her legal experience aids in Lakeland Montessori's compliance and needs in legal matters. Raising these gifted kids is always an experience in flexibility! Characteristics of schools This may manifest in teachers with advanced degrees in their subject, rather than in teaching. It will manifest in teachers who are enthusiastic about their subjects. Flexibility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">A good school for gifted children isn't the school with a canned gifted program. If this isn't possible, no more than 2 or 3 school divisions in K-12. Outdoor education is an included component, with camping, orienteering. Some families have access to Schools for the Gifted . But these schools, too, need careful consideration. Their definition of a gifted child may not describe your child, or your child's educational needs may not fit in their school. Instead, it's the school that offers flexibility, an individualized program based on the needs of the child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">Flexibility also dictates that some gifted children will need higher level academics in some subjects but not others, and some gifted children are twice exceptional, and will require remediation / accommodation in their LD areas, while still receiving appropriate academics in their areas of strength. The school that relies on the student's level and pace, rather than age and grade, for subject placement, will be a much more comfortable school for every student, not just the gifted student. Some folks prefer a small school, but the odds of the gifted child finding peers increase with a larger class pool, or a more selective classroom / school. Zero-tolerance policies tend to result in ridiculous stories, like the 3rd grade recently expelled for the year for bringing scissors to school to work on a project... she didn't threaten anyone, or even remove them from her backpack, but they were cited as a "weapon" and the zero-tolerance policy caused her expulsion (yes, she was reinstated, but not without publicity and public outcry). Community / village environment, where school and children become active part of their community. School has many traditions that create happy memories. Maria Montessori said, "the successive levels of education must conform to the successive personalities of the child."</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">What are the pros and cons of the costs of education? Are you spending your child's college fund? Is this option significantly better fit for your child than the public school options in your area? What are your options if the school turns out not to be a good fit for your child? Is there tuition insurance available? If so, does it cover withdrawal due to educational misfit? Inquire about financial aid.</paragraph><paragraph parID="28">How long will your child be on the bus or in the car to commute to school? If you're driving, double that time for your time-in-car. Is your child a reader, or a mover, and will s/he tolerate that commute? How far away will the other children your child will want to play with outside of school live? Will this affect his/her social interaction in school? In the neighborhood at home? I chose the school because I sought Montessori education with warm, supportive teachers in a cozy, homey atmosphere.</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">My two sons have had wonderful experiences with this school. They have made tremendous strides academically and socially, and love going to school. Pros: The teaching approach is very individualized and child focused. The teachers are very experienced and supportive. There is a lot of interaction with the parents. I really have not experienced any Cons, except that the school only goes to Kindergarten and I wish it went for more years. I also liked the full day kindergarten program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">My older son will be entering First Grade this Fall, and the teachers have prepared him with reading and writing skills that will assist him going forward. NOTE: Montessori schools are organized and certified by many different groups of people, some connected to The International Montessori Index, and many that are not. To learn more about finding a Montessori school in your community please read on. Anyone who is interested in finding or starting a Montessori school should be aware of the fact that the word Montessori , is not patented and anyone can use it. Thus, the use of the word Montessori is no assurance of quality. If you want to enroll your child in a Montessori school it is important that you learn what a Montessori school should be like, and then observe children working in the school you are considering. A certified Montessori-trained adult, the teacher and preferably also a Montessori trained administrator.</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">Learn what you can about certification of schools by your state, and by the variety of Montessori organizations. A full range of tested and proven Montessori materials in a clean, elegant, uncluttered environment. All of the materials were scrounged and parent-made, under the direction of a well-educated Montessori teacher. Montessori schools are found in tiny church halls, large public school building, even homes. There are many different kinds of Montessori teacher certification courses in the world today. DO YOUR RESEARCH - EARLY : It is important for parents to learn all they can about Montessori so they can assess a school they may be interested in for their child. We recommend reading everything on this website, and the excellent Montessori overviews available at this site: www.michaelolaf.net .</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">Many good Montessori schools have a long waiting list so do not put of this search till it is too late. PREPARATION IN THE HOME : There is much parents can do at home in the early year to prepare the young child for a balanced life and also to enter a Montessori class. For this information we recommend the "Joyful Child, Birth to Three Years" information at the Michael Olaf link above, and the information here: http://www.montessori.edu/AtoI.html Montessori Assistants to Infancy Courses. Al though we can give you some pointers for finding a good Montessori school for your child, we are not a substitute for the research you can do in your own community. If this doesn't help you, learn all you can about what a Montessori class should be like, check in your local telephone book and phone the schools. Many Montessori schools were begun by parents who were concerned that their own children have a good educational experience. For many years there were only private schools but because of the success of the Montessori method, there are almost 3,000 Montessori teachers teaching in public schools today , and even more teaching in private schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">The most difficult part of this project is usually rearranging one's life to take a good Montessori teacher training course, or finding a certified Montessori teacher as there are never enough to fill the demand. It is common to sponsor a local person to take the Montessori training course. If you are interested in starting a Montessori school in The United States, practical and extensive information on this subject is available from The North American Montessori Teachers' Association. Therefore we are unable to direct individuals to specific schools. GOOD SCHOOL : In a good school there will be: The teacher or directress/director will not be giving traditional group lessons, but will be implementing the progress of each child through individual lessons and record keeping. The word "certified" is tricky.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">NOTE: The picture on this page was taken in a school in East Africa. Happy, kind children, busy on self-chosen, uninterrupted work. The physical environment is secondary to the natural ability, and the training of the teachers. Some schools are certified by a particular organization and only have teachers with that certification. Some schools have been known to call themselves Montessori schools even though they have no certified teachers. Parents must look carefully into this question. Choose carefully; your child will be entering a second family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">First you could check with the following resources. Have their literature sent and make an a appointment for an observation of a class during a normal day with the children there. Do not select a school solely upon someone else's recommendation, but only after you visit. You may have to apply when your child is very young, as many good schools have waiting lists. Schools are also begun by innovative school administrators and teachers, as charter or magnet schools. This information will also be of value to interested parties in other countries.

Physical Play Physical play is commonly featured on the menu of activities at various pre-school sessions. It's recognised that physical play is an important activity for improving the physical and social skills of young children. They get to work on issues such as co-ordination, balance, taking turns and learning to cooperate and play well with other children and the activities they take part in are fun and enjoyable. Physical play can be carried out indoors in a hall or classroom, or outdoors on the grass or on a playground. Sometimes equipment is used to enhance the experience, such as a slide, tunnel to crawl through, trampoline to jump on or a climbing frame.</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">Arts, Crafts And Music Other organised activities, such as arts and crafts, painting, making collages or sharing stories and songs, are also a typical part of pre-school. Music time is great for encouraging singing, rhythm and listening to stories this gets children interested in books and reading. The overall idea is that children get to try out a variety of different types of play, so they learn new skills, but also get to share and enjoy group activities too. Free Play As well as activities organised for the whole group, many pre-school sessions help develop children's ability to concentrate and play on their own and with other children. for a while.</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">This can include activities such as playing house, drawing, reading, playing games, playing with construction toys, playing make believe games, painting or using play dough. A lot is packed into time at pre-school, but it's certainly not stressful and in between all the play and learning, there's time to relax and unwind too. Nothing beats personal observation. The school that one parent raves about, may be completely wrong for another's child. Conversely, another parent may have decided that "Montessori doesn't work," while it clearly is working very, very well for your family. They are independent. The Montessori approach is often described as an "education for life."</paragraph><paragraph parID="39">From this perspective, a school only exists to cover a curriculum, not to develop character and self-esteem. But in all too many traditional and highly competitive schools, students memorize facts and concepts with little understanding, only to quickly forget them when exams are over. They have a very different set of priorities from traditional schools, and a very low regard for mindless memorization and superficial learning. To her, finding one's place in the world, work that is meaningful and fulfilling, and developing the inner peace and depth of soul that allows us to love are the most important goals in life. by Tim Seldin President of the Montessori Foundation It is difficult to determine precisely how many schools in the United States follow the insights and strategies developed by Dr. Maria Montessori 89 years ago. The Foundation's computers show the names and addresses of almost 4,000 schools; yet each time we visit a new community, we discover dozens more.</paragraph><paragraph parID="40">In 28 years of traveling on behalf of Montessori, I've had the opportunity to visit, work with, and observe more than 650 Montessori schools. The diversity is astounding. Montessori schools are often found in charming homes; the outcome of an individual hobby of the owner/director. These hearty souls live and breath their work, creating wonderful intimate communities that radiate a sense of personal attention and family. Most Montessori schools begin with three-year-olds and extend through the elementary grades. Every year many more open middle school programs at one extreme and programs for infants and toddlers at the other. Montessori schools are often found in affluent communities, but just as many serve working-class neighborhoods and the poor.</paragraph><paragraph parID="41">You can find Montessori in Head Start, the inner cities, migrant workers camps, and on Indian reservations, as Montessori schools offer a wide range of programs. Many are focused on meeting the needs of the working family. Others describe themselves as college-preparatory programs. Public Montessori programs pride themselves on serving all children, while many independent schools work hard to find the perfect match of student, school, and family values. The diversity within Montessori is tremendous. Despite widespread beliefs and misunderstandings about what Montessori is or is not, no two Montessori schools are the same. Some pride themselves on remaining faithful to what they see as Montessori's original vision, while others relish their flexibility and pragmatic adaptation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">Each school reflects its own unique blend of facilities, programs, personality, and interpretation of Dr. Montessori's vision. The International Montessori Community Montessori schools can be found all over the world. Montessori schools are found throughout Western Europe, Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and much of Asia. The movement is widespread in countries like India, Sri Lanka, Korea, and Japan, and it is beginning to mushroom in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and China. No accurate count of the total number of Montessori schools has ever been made, but a reasonable guess might be a hundred thousand. Why is there so much variation among Montessori schools?</paragraph><paragraph parID="43">There are more than 5,000 Montessori schools in North America, but every one is unique. Even within the same school, each class may look and feel quite different from the others, reflecting the interests and personalities of the teachers; however, certain characteristics will be found in all classes that are honestly following the Montessori approach. Dr. Montessori was a brilliant student of child development, and the approach that has evolved out of her research has stood the test of almost 90 years in Montessori schools around the world. The Montessori approach has two great qualities: replicability (it can be translated successfully into all sorts of new situations) and sustainability (Montessori programs don't tend to self-destruct after a few years, as do many other educational reforms). However, the only truly authentic Montessorian was Dr. Maria Montessori herself. The rest of us have been forced to interpret and reinterpret her ideas and methods through the filter of our personalities and experience. Many people assume that "Montessori" schools are essentially alike, perhaps a franchise like McDonald's or Pizza Hut.</paragraph><paragraph parID="44">In reality, they can differ dramatically, in size, facilities, programs, and emotional climate. At the conceptual level, Montessori schools share a common philosophy and approach, but there will always be tremendous variation among schools that use the name "Montessori." How can a parent know if she's found a "real" Montessori school? Although most schools try to remain faithful to their understanding of Dr. Montessori's insights and research, they have all, to some degree, been influenced by the evolution of our culture and technology. Perhaps the a more relevant question in selecting a Montessori school is to consider how well it matches your sense of what you want for your child. Before we established the Montessori Foundation, I served for 22 years as the Headmaster of the Barrie School outside of Washington, DC. In that role, every year I met with hundreds of families who were interested in enrollment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="45">I always began each open house by reminding these bright, eager, and sometimes overly anxious parents that no one educational approach can be right for every child. The wisest goal is to seek out the best fit, not only between the child and the school, but also between parents' values and goals for their child's education and what a given school can realistically deliver. In the end, the selection of a Montessori school comes down to a matter of personal style and preference. If you visit a school and find yourself in harmony with its ambiance and practice, it will represent at least one example of what you define to be a good school. In determining which school is best, parents have to trust their eyes, ears, and gut instincts. Rely on your own experience, not hearsay from other parents. There is probably no clear cut answer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">Often one sign of a school's commitment to professional excellence is their membership in one of the professional Montessori societies, such as the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) or the American Montessori Society (AMS). Both organizations also offer schools the opportunity to become accredited. There are several dozen other smaller organizations. What makes Montessori different? When we try to define what children take away from their years in Montessori, we need to expand our vision to include more than just the basic academic skills. Recent studies show that many bright students are passive learners. They coast through school, earning high grades, but rarely pushing themselves to read material that hasn't been assigned, ask probing questions, challenge their teacher's cherished opinions, or think for themselves.</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">They typically want teachers to hand them the "right answer." The problem isn't with today's children, but with today's schools. Children are as gifted, curious, and creative as they ever were, when they're working on something that captures their interest and which they have voluntarily chosen to explore. Montessori schools work to develop culturally literate children and nurture their fragile sparks of curiosity, creativity, and intelligence. Montessori students may not memorize as many facts, but they do tend to become self-confident, independent thinkers who learn because they are interested in the world and enthusiastic about life, not simply to get a good grade. Montessori believed that there was more to life than simply the pursuit of wealth and power. The name Montessori is not legally protected, and can be used by anyone, for any purpose; it is vital that anyone searching for a good Montessori school or teacher-training center be aware of this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">Most of the Montessori sites on the Internet today exists to advertise one particular Montessori organization, school, or training center. The International Montessori Index was created to provide detailed comparative information in order to help in the search for a school or training center. Details are given to aid parents in looking for a school that follows Dr. Montessori's teachings, and all Montessori training centers and organizations who are official members of The International Montessori Index share their specifics details for comparison with others. Montessori is a revolutionary method of observing and supporting the natural development of children. Montessori educational practice helps children develop creativity, problem solving, critical thinking and time-management skills, to contribute to society and the environment, and to become fulfilled persons in their particular time and place on Earth. The basis of Montessori practice in the classroom is mixed age group (3 ages - 6 ages in one class), individual choice of research and work, and uninterrupted concentration. Group lessons are seldom found in a Montessori classroom, but learning abounds.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">As you read through these pages you will discover the unique practices that make Montessori the fastest growing and most successful method of education today. FINDING A SCHOOL or TEACHER TRAINING COURSE: The International Montessori Index is not sponsored by, or officially connected with any specific Montessori school or training center. We are not in a position to direct individuals to specific Montessori schools or Montessori training courses. Sites presently linking The International Montessori Index include those of the education departments of colleges and universities, parenting groups, religious organization, Montessori organizations, schools, and training centers, and gifted and homeschooling organizations. Work Centers A Montessori education allows children to move freely from one work center to another. Learning to share, community service and other positive character traits are taught. Materials are designed to engage children and encourage them to use all of their sense to explore and learn.</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">This is a good philosophy to follow if you like the idea of teaching in learning centers AND if you really can give your child chunks of time to work. Also, you will notice that the curriculum is child-directed which, as previously discussed, is difficult to deal with if your state has very strict home schooling regulations. Montessori pre-schools have become very popular in the last decade or so and it seems the mention of their name conjures ideas of gifted and academically bright students. According to Dr. Montessori, a 19th century educator and medical doctor, such academic achievement is a result of children learning according to their interests in a supportive environment. At the core, a Montessori education allows children to choose what they're interested in studying and encourages children to learn through all of their senses, not just through listening, watching and reading. A Montessori philosophy would say that if a child is encouraged to learn at his own pace, and study things that truly interest him, then the child will flourish, be motivated to further study and truly love learning. 3 Hour Work Periods Children are encouraged to concentrate on their individual (and usually self-selected) work for one or two three hour periods per day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">Students meet with teachers, but the long work period is never (well, relatively speaking) interrupted by the teacher to teach a lesson. The child should be allowed to linger as long as he would like at a particular center. There are no desks or chairs, because that would restrict movement and freedom. Teach by Teaching The teacher does not correct student work. It is up to the teacher, through careful observation and record keeping, the determine what the child needs and to plan appropriate activities for him to learn and improve in weaknesses. Renaissance Parenting All subjects are interwoven and no subject is taught in isolation. Teachers, or in this case parents, are to model the "renaissance" attitude when it comes to learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">They are to display a wide variety of interests and a wide base of knowledge. Character Education Children's character is considered equally important as their academic development. Montessori Materials Montessori schools carefully select their learning materials and books. A true Montessori school (or homeschool) would never allow a television or other electronic gadgets. I know in our house, getting a chunk of extended time without interruption would be impossible. In the late 1960s, parents in several school districts began to agitate for public school to offer the Montessori model for their elementary school children who had graduated from private Montessori preschools. A teacher shortage resulted in the opening of private Montessori teacher training centers that were typically free-standing, that is, not associated with a college or university.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">Montessori materials are designed for use by individual students or small groups, rather than as teacher presentation aides. The most important criterion for an elementary Montessori class is student activity. Another important aspect of Montessori classes is an attitude of cooperation rather than competition. Although public Montessori schools comply with requirements for achievement tests, many Montessorians see these tests as being irrelevant to much of what students learn. One problem relating to public schools' implementation of Montessori programs is admission criteria. Should children be admitted to elementary Montessori classes based on whether they have had Montessori preschool experience? Montessori classes work very differently depending on the percentage of children with Montessori experience.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">Some children without Montessori preschool experience adapt easily to expectations in the Montessori elementary class and some do not. When children who cannot work independently are in the minority, the teacher can focus attention, use older children as tutors, and so on. When this group makes up the majority of the class, Montessori practices involving free choice for major portions of the day are hard to implement, at least early in the school year. But public school programs' restriction of enrollment to those whose families were able to afford private Montessori preschool poses an equity problem. District-sponsored or reduced-tuition preschool classes solve the problem, but such classes are not part of all public Montessori programs. School districts use many admission criteria; it's not clear that any of them are entirely satisfactory. Scarcity of Teachers</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">The biggest problem in starting and maintaining a public school Montessori program may be the lack of qualified Montessori elementary teachers. Teachers in public programs must have both state teacher certification and Montessori elementary school teacher training. This means that a state-certified teacher takes a year, or at least a summer, to study Montessori, or that a Montessori elementary teacher takes a year off to go to a university to become a state-certified teacher. In either case, the teacher pays twice, and sits through at least some content a second time. Thus, even with higher salaries and more benefits than private schools, it is often difficult for public school programs to fill positions. As a result, some teachers work in Montessori programs without the combination of elementary Montessori certification and state credentials. In spite of these difficulties with implementation, research indicates that Montessori is a popular alternative to traditional public school education and is successful in terms of achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">Many successful magnet programs in the public schools have been able to integrate state education requirements and Montessori requirements. By and large, Montessori programs are successful magnets in attracting and educating students, as shown by achievement test data (Duax, 1989). As a consequence, both schools and teacher education programs have proliferated without regulations or restrictions. For 3-4 hours a day, students engage in individual and small group work of their choice. Students also receive instruction individually or in small groups. Classes that spend over an hour a day in whole group instruction are departing from the Montessori model. It is common for students to ask other students for help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">In keeping with a reduced emphasis on conventional testing, answers to problems are made available to students. Finally, the development of individual responsibility is emphasized. From the beginning, the name Montessori has been in the public domain in the U.S. Fortunately, many Montessori teacher education courses have some community college, college, or university affiliation, and some offer Master of Education degrees with the Montessori Program. But the majority of the public schools have not chosen to affiliate with either organization, usually citing financial restrictions. These choices are, of course, guided by the teacher. The children maintain the classroom and materials, and participate in developing class rules.</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">A survey conducted by the author in 1981 collected data from 25 of the approximately 50 school districts known to have Montessori programs at the time (Chattin-McNichols, 1981). About two thirds of the programs provided free transportation. Pre-school learning environments are specially designed to be age appropriate for young children, helping to support and boost their development and learning. Pre-schools are available to children under the age of five years old and offer a safe, supportive and inspiring environment in which children gain a foundation of early education. The pre-schools in the UK are run by qualified teachers, who are qualified in teaching this particular age group of children, as well as other trained staff who are all geared up to the needs of the early years. Pre-schools have to be registered and are inspected regularly by government bodies, so you can be assured that the standards of learning are maintained. Most centres follow a government-approved early years curriculum, otherwise known as the Foundation Stage, and work to achieve the same Early Learning Goals for children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">Children participate in a wide range of learning activities whilst at pre-school. Being in a pre-school environment and having a small schedule to keep to helps prepare children for when they go to school properly. There are also heaps of social benefits too, as they learn what it's like to be with peers their own age and interact with them socially throughout each session. This includes vital experience with making friends, falling out and learning about different people's viewpoints, all of which help the social and emotional learning experience. Studies have found, for example, that children who have a good basis of early learning before they start school are well prepared for the learning that's ahead of them. In fact, one large government-funded study found that children who'd attended pre-school do better in education at the age of 10 and that those who'd experienced pre-school learning at home as well scored better in maths tests at the age of 10. It's highly beneficial to let your child attend such sessions, as they offer a valuable opportunity for children to try out new activities, learn new skills and socialise with their peers (plus, it provides some parents with a welcome break!)</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">In fact, attending nurseries and playgroups is something that is actively encouraged by the government in England, as the early years are an important stage of children's development and learning, and the more learning they're able to experience, the better start in life they gain. There are various different forms of free early learning sessions available, including through attendance at playschools and nurseries. Whilst nurseries are usually easy to find and have their own set buildings and environment, playgroups tend to be held on a more ad hoc basis. All playschools, nurseries and other forms of pre-school learning environments follow the Foundation Stage of early education. Both playgroups and nurseries aim to provide a fun and stimulating environment for children. They're still only young, so don't need strict formal timetables or hard work - by making learning fun, they help instil basic educational concepts - like literacy, reading and maths - which provide a great introduction for when children start school. Montessori (pronounced MON-tuh-SORE-ee) education was founded in 1907 by Dr. Maria Montessori, the first woman in Italy to become a physician.</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">Montessori represents an entirely different approach to education. There are more Montessori programs for ages 3-6 than for any other age group, but Montessori is not limited to early childhood. Many infant/toddler programs (ages 18 months to 3 years) exist, as well as elementary (6-12), adolescent (ages 12-15) and even a few Montessori high schools. The two major ones operating in the United States are the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI, with a U.S. branch office called AMI-USA) and the American Montessori Society (AMS). Though different Montessori schools will share similarities, from a few to many, each school is independent. Academic success is not affected by the transition from Montessori to traditional school. She based her educational methods on scientific observation of children's learning processes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">Guided by her discovery that children teach themselves, Dr. Montessori designed a "prepared environment" in which children could freely choose from a number of developmentally appropriate activities. Now, nearly a century after Maria Montessori's first Case dei Bambini (Children's House) in Rome, Montessori education is found all over the world, spanning ages from birth to adolescence. What is the difference between Montessori and traditional education? Montessori emphasizes learning through all five sense, not just listening, watching, or reading. Children in Montessori classes learn at their own, individual pace and according to their own choice of activities from hundreds of possibilities. Learning is an exciting process of discovery, leading to concentration, motivation, self-discipline, and a love of learning. Montessori classes place children in a three-year age group (3-6, 6-9, 9-12, and so on), forming communities in which the older children spontaneously share their knowledge with the younger ones.</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">Is Montessori good for children with learning disabilities? What about gifted children? Montessori is designed to help all children reach their fullest potential at their own unique pace. A classroom whose children have varying abilities is a community in which everyone learns from one another and everyone contributes. Moreover, multi-age grouping allows each child to find his or her own pace without feeling "ahead" or "behind" in relation to peers. What ages does Montessori serve? Are Montessori children successful later in life?</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">Research studies show that Montessori children are well prepared for later life academically, socially, and emotionally. In addition to scoring well on standardized tests, Montessori children are ranked above average on criteria such as, following directions, turning in work on time, listening attentively, using basic skills, showing responsibility, asking provocative questions, showing enthusiasm for learning, and adapting to new situations. Wh at special training do Montessori teachers have? As with the choice of a Montessori school for children, an adult must also exercise wisdom in choosing a teacher training course. Anyone can legally use the name "Montessori" in describing their teacher training organization. One must be sure that the certification earned is recognized by the school where one desires to teach. The two major organizations offering Montessori training in the United States are the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI, with a U.S. branch office called AMI-USA) and the American Montessori Society (AMS).</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">Most training centers require a bachelor's degree for admission. Training ranges from 200 to 600 pre-service contact hours, and covers principles of child development and Montessori philosophy, as well as specific uses of the Montessori classroom materials. Montessori training centers can be found across North American and around the world. Who accredits or oversees a Montessori school? Unfortunately, there is no way to limit the use of the name "Montessori." Parents must carefully research, and observe a classroom in operation, in order to choose a real Montessori school for their child. There are several Montessori organizations to which schools can belong.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">Parents considering placing a child in a Montessori school should ask about the school's accreditations and affiliations. What is the best way to choose a Montessori school for my child? Ask if the school is affiliated with any Montessori organization. Ask what kind of training the teachers have. Visit the school, observe the classroom in action, and later ask the teacher or principal to explain the theory behind the activities you saw. Most of all, talk to your child's prospective teacher about his or her philosophy of child development and education to see if it is compatible with your own. How relevant are Montessori methods in today's world?</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">While appropriate changes have been made to the original Montessori curriculum (including the introduction of computers and modifications to the Practical Life exercises to keep them culturally relevant), the basic concepts have not changed much since Dr. Montessori's lifetime, because the developmental stages of humans have not changed. Meanwhile, contemporary research and evaluation seem to be confirming Montessori's insights. How does the teacher keep track of so many students who are working independently? The teacher keeps a record of every student's lessons and projects. Daily observations is another tool that teachers use to evaluate each student. This helps students lean how to evaluate their work, and progress and communicate with their teachers their strengths and weaknesses. How do teachers deal with discipline?</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">Conflicts arise naturally out of interaction between different people. The balance of freedom and responsibilities found in the Montessori Classroom teaches each child to have respect for self, for others, for the classroom, and for the materials. In addition, with guidance from teachers and staff, children at each level are taught conflict resolution skills. They begin the life-long process of learning to respect others' opinions and to search for win-win solutions for conflicts. How will I know how my child is doing? Parents meet with teachers, twice a year, for an in-depth conference;  and a third narrative report is issued at the end of each school year. Parents are strongly urged to educate themselves about Montessori Philosophy and the curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">Parents are also encouraged to schedule visits with their child in the classroom, and to contact teachers with questions and concerns. Are all Montessori schools the same? Montessori is not a trademark name and simply refers to the Montessori method of teaching. How do children fare in the transition from Montessori to traditional schools? The transfer from Montessori is generally quite smooth. There is, of course, an initial adjustment period, just as there is in any transfer between schools. Early Education Options</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">You want to give your infant the best possible start in life. So you are thinking about finding a preschool which will pick up where you left off as a parent and educate your child according to your wishes. Let's look at the various types of preschools available. Dr. Maria Montessori believed in following the child. Her Casa de Bambini educated thousands of Rome's poorest children in the early part of the 20th century. Montessori schools usually offer classes for toddlers through kindergarten. Many Montessori schools have primary and middle school grades as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">Only a handful of Montessori schools offer the high school grades even though Dr. Montessori planned her method to cover all levels of instruction. Like Dr. Maria Montessori Rudolph Steiner believed the societal change could only come about through quality education. The curriculum in Waldorf schools is based on the philosophy known as anthroposophy which was Steiner's own creation. Schools which embrace the Reggio Emilia approach are said to be 'Reggio Emilia inspired'. As with Montessori and Waldorf, Reggio Emilia had its beginnings as a way of educating children from families of modest means. Montessori, Waldorf and Reggio Emilia schools fall within the category of schools we define as progressive schools. There are also approximately 100 private schools serving the preschool programs which do not follow those philosophies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">They embrace a variety of approaches, theories and philosophies which place them firmly within the progressive camp. In this group are the dozens of laboratory schools which many universities host and operate within their education departments. If your religious beliefs are any important part of the way you are raising your child, then you will want to consider a religious preschool. Unless you are absolutely familiar with a school, don't assume anything, even if it is a match with your religious beliefs. Do your due diligence and confirm that the teaching style and what is being taught jibe with your needs and requirements. Montessori del Mar Bilingual School is pleased to announce the purchase of property for its new home; two hectares of beautiful land less than 500 meters from the entrance of La Pura Vida road, between Cobano and Montezuma. This completes the licensing requirements of the Ministry of Education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">There's a lot less crying, nose-picking, and general squirrelly-ness in a class full of 6-year-olds. But it's a tremendous waste of early learning opportunities - and a trend that I don't support. Starting Kindergarten at the age of 5 or even 4 is fine - and even preferable - for many children. This will be the first Montessori school offering education up to the 6th grade in the whole of Costa Rica. Our dream is to create an international Montessori bilingual school for primary and secondary levels, the continuation of the work started in 2003 at our present location in Cabuya. Our goal is to open a space for the education of our children in the beauty of Nature, the biggest laboratory. The idea is to bring together excellent, creative and experienced Montessori educators, artists and scientists who want to become part of our project and help to make it a reality.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">Our mission 'education for life, through freedom, in a beautiful and prepared environment,' will be taken a step further.

No.1   Caminemos con los ideales Montessorianos Your contribution at this point will help finance building the schoolhouse, computer lab, library, kitchen, multiuse pavilion, playground and gardens. This pioneering endeavor is an important part of your children's future that is being structured now. The Montessori concept of the Prepared Enviornment , that the school house should be designed to facilitate independent learning and exploration, fits well with The Natural Learning Initiative's (NLI) focus on designing the outdoor environment so that children will have the opportunity to discover nature and the joy of playing outside. Adults work in concert to support children's development as active, peaceful, life-long learners and global citizens."</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">Montessori instruction expects that the student will be responsible for his/her own success and actively involved in purposeful learning. Montessori principles for students feature: Large blocks of uninterrupted work time Multi-age grouping Integration of subject disciplines A variety of work options Cooperative groups and peer teaching</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">Creation and care of the environment In addition to rigorous academic standards, the Montessori environment compels us to give special attention to the concept of "valorization" which is the development of the adolescent physically, socially, and emotionally. This helps students discover the best of themselves. The learning environment is structured to allow students to think deeply and critically as they become leaders who take responsibility for their education and community through the following experiences: Daily self-reflection Student-led conferences Community building and student leadership</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">Service learning projects Students learn through discovery, including having their own garden at the school, participating in community service projects and joining one or more of the many clubs and activities at the school. This new magnet middle school continues the DPS Montessori experience that students currently have at Watts and Morehead Montessori Magnet Elementary Schools, along with space for additional students from a variety of backgrounds through the DPS magnet school lottery process. Core curriculum areas taught within each of the Montessori classroom communities are language arts, math, science and social studies. Electives include a second language (Latin), visual arts, physical education/health, strings, band and chorus/theater. Advanced mathematics is also taught as a separate class. Homeschooling does not completely eliminate a student's chance to socialize with other children their age, but significantly reduces the amount of time spent interacting with others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">This requires homeschooling parents to find social activities to ensure that their child receives enough social interaction to properly develop their social skills. The drawbacks to having control over the curriculum are that it places a lot of pressure on the parents and leaves open the possibility that a subject will not be completely discussed. The Ability to Incorporate Religious Instruction In a home school curriculum science, math and other subjects can be taught through religious texts and contain religious-themed lesson plans and assignments. This permits parents to provide their children an education that conforms to their personal beliefs. A home school curriculum can, but does not need, to be religiously based. Public schools typically provide students with advanced technological tools to supplement their education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">These include calculators and scientific lab tools such as beakers, burners and chemicals. Some of these items, such as calculators, are easily obtainable by homeschooling parents, but others, such as chemicals are not. Freedom and Flexibility in Learning Chemistry classes can take place in the kitchen and botany classes in the family's garden. It is very easy to spend more time on a subject if a parent feels the student has not yet grasped it completely, and it is also easy to breeze through a subject that the student masters faster than anticipated. State required curriculums and the number of students requires teachers to keep all students on the same track for the sake of ease. This can result in students being bored due to not being challenged or to students falling behind because they required more instruction on the topic.</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">Homeschooling vs Public Schools: The Pros and Cons of Homeschooling The decision of whether to home school a child or to send a child to public school is a personal one. Not only is the parent's time and ability to act as a teacher important, but whether the child's education and socialization needs will be met must also be considered. There are several benefits and drawbacks to homeschooling. However, these drawbacks and benefits are not universal and should be analyzed by each family individually. The Impact on Socialization Many psychologists, teachers and therapists support the argument that one of the most important aspects of schooling is socialization.</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">At school students learn how to interact with other children and adults, appropriately respond to conflict and developing friendships. While this is by no means an entirely negative aspect to homeschooling, it does require parents to research, register, pay for and attend additional activities solely for the purpose of socialization. Control over Curriculum Perhaps the most often discussed aspect of homeschooling is the ability for parents to control the curriculum. With homeschooling, parents can introduce the topics of study as well as the lesson plans covering that topic. This provides parents with the means to reduce or eliminate altogether those aspects of a particular topic that they feel unnecessary or uncivilized. Of course, state education laws often require parents to cover specific topics within subjects, but how those topics are handled is up to the parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">Purchasing pre-made home school curriculum materials can keep parents focused and on track. Parents often use this capability to provide their children with a religious education. While by no means do all home school curriculums include religious instruction, unlike public schools it is possible to include the topic as often as a parent would like. Of course, secular education has its benefits. For many parents, even those that home school, separating religion and education is important. The option, however, is attractive to many parents. Access to Educational Tools</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">This may mean that a child does not receive instruction in some areas, particularly science. For example, animal dissection and other scientific studies are rarely taught at home. One of the biggest benefits to homeschooling is the ability for the curriculum and lesson plans to be adjusted to the student's learning style. Moreover, lesson plans can be as creative and unique as a parent wants. This is one aspect of homeschooling that public schools often cannot match. The chance of either of these occurring for homeschooled children is significantly less. Ultimately, the decision of whether to home school your child is a question of whether the program and curriculum of homeschooling vs public schools is a better fit for both you and your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">: This article, provided by Family Matters Parenting Magazine, discusses questions for parents to consider when investigating whether to home school their children. Pros: * Clean, Bright, Dedicated classroom that is attached, but very separated from the house. * Huge backyard and playground * Literally tons of Montessori and educational toys that rotate every 1-2 months with the theme. * Multi-generational teachers 2 older, and 2 younger. So the kids benefit from both experience and youthful energy. * Male and female teachers (great for boys) * Kids and teachers of all hues and cultures. They celebrate any and all holidays.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">* Teacher:student ratio is usually amazing with 2-3 teachers with the group, sometimes only 2-6 kids (14 is max) * Children don't need to be potty-trained (they encourage whatever stage the child is in) * Just off Pinole Valley Road exit on I-80, easy commute, easy parking, safe cul-de-sac * Schedule is flexible with days and times, afternoons are not very full. Part-time or Full time, breaks on tuition for paying in advance. Cons: * We must bring our own food- which could be a plus if your child needs something specific. * They follow something like a public school schedule, so there are lots of ''days off'' during the year. But there is always a great change to the classroom when we come back after break. I've seen the program be successful for kids who are gifted and those with developmental disabilties. I am super happy parent writing to tell you more about Montessori Children's House of Pinole.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">No commercial figures like Disney or even Sesame Street. The least expensive, least snobby, best preparation for ''real'' life, with the best parts of a Montessori education built in. My daughter attended for two years, from aged 3 to 5. My 2 year old will begin attending when he is 3. This program embodies the Montessori philosophy that a child is a willing learner and will learn if given proper support and a facilitating environment, including supportive teachers. The two teachers, Kathy and June are incredible. On top of this they have each taught for between 20 and 30 years and have worked together for fifteen years, so there is an incredible rapport and sophisticated teamwork that keeps things flowing smoothly and warmly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">The space itself is great. It is in a converted home on a quiet cul de sac. The classroom is colorful, text rich, bright, sunny and full of great diagnostic toys and art. The playarea is large and there are grassy areas and woodchipped play structure area. There is nothing for them to get in trouble for trampling and nowhere for them to go that is not in view and supervised. The teachers are very proactive so there are few behavioral issues,when they do come up they are handled well. The school draws people from various cities in the east bay and feeds into both local and private schools, including many to Windrush and Prospect Sierra.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">It is a nice parent/family community of lawyers, poets, teachers, business owners, stay-at-home moms, mechanics- basically very ecclectic middle class. True to the idea of kids first, the program has a range of times and days you can attend, from two days a week for three hours up to all day, 9-5, five days a week. You will not find snottiness, hype, marketing, fundraising, staff turnover, coldness or profit-first thinking. The kids are always happy to be at school (as the are the younger sibs whose parents must daily pry them from the schools doorjamb while the kids protest having to leave. It is ALL about the kids and their learning and playing and having a sweeter childhood for the addition of these brilliant women and their great program. Hi, I didn't see the original post, but I can highly recommend Montessori Children's House of Pinole. They have all the great Montessori materials and use Montessori methods, and yet the classroom is not overly structured or too ''quiet.''</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">They take kids from 2.5 to 6 years, and it is a richly diverse bunch of kids and parents. (Jan 2002) Kathy Maloney runs the Montessori Children's House on Johanna Ct. My sister used to work for her and has nothing but highly positive things to say both about Kathy and the program. I heard another Montessori teacher refer to it as the "only truly Montessori" program in the area. The Pros and Cons of Unschooling About Unschooling: is it Right For My Child? Unschooling is a form of homeschooling that encourages natural, child-led learning although the way individual families choose to unschool varies drastically.</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">This allowed students of varying skill levels to be in one student-centered classroom, each learning at his or her own rate. The Pros of Unschooling Unschooled children are free to explore and learn about any subject matter that interests them within a flexible schedule. The family can pick up and go at a moment's notice or schedule doctor appointments, piano and other lessons during the day when others are in school. Visits to museums and other places of interest are generally more relaxed and informative as these venues are not as crowded as they are in the evenings or on weekends when all the schooled families flock to visit. When a child is allowed to learn through hands-on, real-life situations, he or she learns the facts and not just how to manipulate a process. Unschooling continues the environment for real-world learning from infancy to adulthood.</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">Pat Farenga, a leading advocate for unschooling, explains, "get them out of the classroom and into the real world. Less Stress Knowing they do not need to prove themselves as professional, certified teachers by following the imposed demands of a curriculum relieves unschooling parents of a great deal of stress. Instead, the parent and the child are free to explore as much or as little about a subject together. In a traditional classroom setting, a lot of learning time is taken up with crowd control methods such as roll call, collecting assignments and other administrative duties. Unschooling can be done inexpensively or even for free. There is no curriculum to purchase, special uniforms to buy, lunch money to send, or costs for gifts for teachers and classmates.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">Unschooling creates an environment where children are nurtured and allowed to grow and learn naturally. The emphasis is placed on learning and relating rather than finishing a chapter or passing a test. The result is a bonded relationship within the family structure. If there is more than one child in the household, this provides opportunities for growth and learning how to relate and get along with each other. The learning may be child-led, but the parents still become quite involved in their child's education through guidance (not control), by placing learning opportunities within the child's path. Unschooling is sometimes referred to as "stoking the fires of learning" as opposed to "filling an empty vessel". When a child is interested in a topic, it's a natural progression to learn about everything associated with that topic.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">Learning, then, becomes easy and natural without friction and arguments. This opens up the potential of grasping concepts at a much higher level than is allowed in the confines of a set curriculum, thus creating a love for learning. Unschooling allows every child to learn at his or her own level without competition. It works extremely well with parents of multiple-grade-level children. It's difficult to follow traditional lesson plans with several students at various grade levels; but the entire family can use what Charlotte Mason refers to as "Living Books" (learning through literature, not textbooks). If you read a story about King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, for instance, a young child can color a picture of castles and knights while listening, whereas, an older child may want to delve into studying more about medieval times. Because unschooling does not spell out when and what needs to be learned, it can seem chaotic for a parent who is looking for more instruction and guidance on the precise ways to teach and keep order.</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">Many parents who are new to homeschooling become discouraged and feel unprepared to allow instruction and learning in this manner. Unschooling provides very little guidelines in terms of standardized testing results. What the child is actually learning may jump around from first grade level to fifth grade level and then back to kindergarten level. The child may even fall below grade level in some areas until he or she wants to catch up. With no quantifiable method of proof that their child is learning, some parents feel out of control. Homeschoolers deal with negative or critical comments and questioning from others, but unschoolers tend to get this reaction even from their homeschooling peers. The notion of unschooling raises the eyebrows of many onlookers who are unfamiliar with, or disapproving of, this method of education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">This can come from unexpected, otherwise trusted, sources such as an uncle or grandparent who feels the need to put your child on the spot by quizzing him on facts that even his public-schooled peers may not know. There are critics of unschooling who say it is nothing more than out-of-control chaos and educational neglect within an environment the child controls, like something out of the book Lord of the Flies . This would suggest that the child is undisciplined and spoiled, never really learning how to cope with conflict, unpleasant circumstances or being told no. While some homeschooling groups organize ceremonies and functions such as proms, year book signings and graduations, these are typically smaller, less formal affairs than in a traditional school. This can be a difficult adjustment for a parent or student to make, especially if the parent grew up enjoying these rites of passage. If the child has already attended a traditional school for any amount of time, the parent and child can spend several months doing nothing more than adjusting to a new way of doing things and shifting cultural expectations. The Homeschool Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) reports that homeschooling, which includes unschooling, is legal in all 50 states, but some states require more paperwork than others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">Most require some form of keeping track of the child's work or logging a set number of credit hours for required subjects. For an unschooler, this requires some creative thinking to figure out how a day filled with reading, visiting a museum, playing a computer learning game, and shooting some basketballs through a hoop all fall into the subjects required to be logged. In states where testing is required, it can be a difficult challenge for unschoolers who don't believe in testing. Because unschooling is a legal option, some parents are able to hide under the covering of unschooling (homeschooling) when in reality, they are neglecting or inflicting harm on their children. This, fortunately, is not the motivating factor for the vast majority of unschoolers. In fact, a parent who chooses to use the umbrella of unschooling to cover up an unlawful act is not even truly unschooling to begin with, but merely keeping her child truant for harmful intentions. The vast majority of schools calling themselves "Montessori" do offer a high quality and authentic Montessori program but a little research on your part can ensure you are making an informed choice for you and your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">When you are looking for a quality Montessori school as either a parent or prospective teacher it is important to keep in mind that schools are operated independently and are either privately owned or run by a non-profit association. The name "Montessori" is not copyrighted and so any school can claim that it is offering an authentic Montessori program. It is often the case that a Montessori school administrator will encourage parents to observe at the school before enrolling their child. This is an excellent way to assess if the school will be an environment that will suit the developmental needs of your child. You will be invited to observe in a classroom setting while the children are in attendance. It is important to enquire about the training and experience level of the teachers and whether parent education evenings are offered. For further information on choosing a Montessori school that maintains a program based on internationally recognized standards you may wish to refer to our extensive reading list to learn more about Montessori principles and the preparation of the Montessori classroom environment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">It offers an objective form of quality control when a school cannot meet the AMI criteria for school recognition because of regulations, a process that parents will understand and appreciate. Valencia Montessori School was founded with the purpose of creating a natural space where children develop and grow in harmony. In Valencia Montessori we firmly believe that every child is unique, and we welcome their diversity and its individual growth during the first and most important years of their life. The school teaches the Montessori method as the vehicle of learning based on observation, it helps to develop the intellectual curiosity and security in oneself as the beginning of a happy learning. As a complement to the All-day Montessori program, we offer activities that inspire new knowledge and experiences that can be found regularly. Activities such as gardening, art, crafts, music, kitchen, help to cultivate values such as patience, persistence, concentration, attention and internal balance with oneself. To provide a learning according to the needs of each stage and according to the Montessori philosophy, it was necessary to find a space that operate in harmony with the natural environment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">Also in Valencia Montessori School we will make use of recycled materials, organic cleaning products and will disclose the respect towards the environment that surrounds us everyday. The school teaches pedagogy Montessori within the British System , following the rules and guidelines of the Ministry of education of the United Kingdom. Taught by native teachers AMI (Association Montessori International), the school provides English as a vehicular language. Spanish is important in learning, reading and writing skills and culture, integrated into the weekly schedule of the school. Valencia Montessori School will initially host the periods aged from 2 months up to 6 years with a short term forecast to continue with the Primary stage. Nevertheless, Valencia Montessori School is a place where learning and the natural world are connected. There was a morning and afternoon session.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">The Montessori School continued to flourish at the new location with their excellent reputation for strength in teaching skills to prepare the children for their elementary education. When the Montessori School began at Alvernia in the fall term of 1963, it was regarded as part of the teaching program of Alvernia University (then, Alvernia College). It was initiated through the efforts of Alvernia President, Sister M. Zygmunta. Employing the Montessori method of teaching, the school was known as the Montessori Children's House. Three Berks County families Dr. &amp;amp; Mrs. James Ciabattoni of West Reading, Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Michael Devereux of Reinholds, and Mr. &amp;amp; Mrs. Thomas Wolff of Reifton originally came up with the idea for the Montessori School. But early efforts were frustrated by difficulty of obtaining a certified Montessori teacher and renting or leasing a suitable premise for a school. Sister Floretta, while not a certified Montessori teacher, had training in the method and was assigned as the first teacher for the Montessori school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">She received her American Montessori Diploma in June, 1965, but left the school a year later. The initial enrollment of the school was approximately 36 children, open to children of any religious denomination in the 3 to 5 year age group. They appealed to the Bernardine sisters to allow the school to continue for a further year's operation during which time adequate plans could be made for the following year. (This building was razed in 1992.) Because the Provincial Superior of the Bernardine Sisters, Sister M. Blanche, did not allow the School to continue on the grounds of Alvernia University, the Directors moved the Montessori Children's House to Centre Avenue in Reading. This ended the Montessori School at Alvernia until 1968 when St. Joseph's Villa was opened for the aged and infirm Sisters of the Bernardine Franciscan Community, leaving the old St. Elizabeth's Infirmary building empty. The sisters decided to renovate the old infirmary and open a Montessori School of their own.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">Also the building would house a Remedial Reading Center for grade-school children. The School also received approval to be a Private Academic Nursery and Kindergarten in 1971 (although the school opened in September of 1970 while the Director was in the process of obtaining the License from the State). Sister Mericia continued on as the Director of the School until May of 1979. During her term as Director, the School started to flourish with approximately 20 children in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Sister brought several Bernardine Sisters to teach in the school. Sister Ann Marie Coll became the Second Director of the Alvernia Montessori School during the 1979-1980 school year, and continues as the Director of the school today. In the spring of 1997, Alvernia University signed an agreement with the Bernardine Sisters to manage the School financially.</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">Under the new agreement, the Bernardine Sisters would continue to own the school, while Alvernia University would be the administrative manager of the school. In June of 2003, The Montessori School moved to Sacred Heart School in West Reading when the Sacred Heart Convent underwent extensive renovations. Alvernia University agreed to rent space for the school with a lease of 3-5 Years. Montessori classes are made up of children in a three-year age range: preschools have 3- and 4-year-olds and kindergartners; elementary classes have first, second, and third graders, and so on. Montessori materials are designed for use by individual students or small groups, rather than as teacher presentation aids. In math, materials represent math concepts, such as fractions and decimals. In geography, students work with puzzle maps, in which each continent has been made into a puzzle, the pieces of which are countries.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">Based on the life&#65533;s work of Dr. Maria Montessori, the Montessori method has a broad vision of education and follows the natural development of the individual child and their innate directive that freely guides them toward growth and maturity. The children&#65533;s innate passion for learning is encouraged by giving them opportunities to engage in spontaneous, purposeful activities with specific materials under the guidance of a trained adult. Within a framework of order, the children progress at their own pace and rhythm, according to their individual capabilities. Montessori recognizes a developmental order from birth to adulthood and activities and environment are adjusted to suit developmental needs. Parents give up because they are unhappy with some part of the homeschooling process, and often it&#65533;s because the parents themselves can&#65533;t agree on how the homeschooling should unfold. I was introduced to the idea of homeschooling at a mother&#65533;s club meeting, and knew in my heart that I wanted a more natural way of learning tailored to my sons&#65533; strong interests and abilities. He thinks that group learning situations lead to better socialization.</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">The kids hated it and I agreed. However, even though my boys have been doing well overall, if they don&#65533;t see the relevance of learning something I introduce, they won&#65533;t cooperate. They whine and complain and are unwilling to try new things. We liked having some direction and encouragement to try new things. I get frustrated and exhausted and don&#65533;t follow through with planned activities, and then the boys just play. Carl tries to help by teaching them subjects he thinks they need to learn, but they are often resistant to doing what he asks. The ensuing arguments are exhausting for everyone.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">But attending a homeschool park day reveals a community educating children without the common trappings and constraints of traditional schooling. Parents are inundated with an excess of educational products designed to complement various learning styles or methodologies, not to mention the field trips, co-op classes, and social events organized by homeschool support groups. The demands on time to cover it all, and the challenge of family dynamics as you try to get used to a new homeschool rhythm and routine, can be overwhelming. Parents decide together what qualities, characteristics and skills are most important to them in the adults they hope their children will become, and then build an environment that supports and nurtures the development of those young adults. Even with a shared vision, homeschool parents can still be sidetracked from their mutual goal by the luxury of too many options in the task of educating their children. They present a positive approach that is based on working with each person&#65533;s natural gifts and dispositions, rather than applying dysfunctional labels such as A.D.D., dyslexic, gifted, hyperactive, or learning disabled. Since nearly every method has spawned innumerable curriculum products, it helps to have a passing familiarity with the methodologies to filter and screen curriculum materials to find those that will suit your children&#65533;s interests, needs, and abilities best.</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">There aren&#65533;t easy answers, and there&#65533;s no one right approach. Parents who take the time to develop a shared vision, and then work together to create an environment that supports it, will have a better chance of achieving homeschool success and happiness. A typical student hastens through the eight school hours, refuels for an additional two hours of extracurricular activities and then comes home to a mountainous heap of assignments. This program promised only two and a half hour school days, no Friday classes, intimate settings, accommodating schedules, and undivided attention throughout the year. However, in the end, you will gain experience and confidence, and those are two priceless treasures. The opportunity was to engage in an alternative learning program. It sounded perfect, but I knew that once I signed this contract, gold and yellow pep rallies would rest in peace, homecoming games would take place without my observations, and finding the perfect prom dress would remain in my dreams.</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">Alternative schools cater to student needs and enhance students' strengths while defeating their weaknesses. Enrolling in an alternative learning program has broadened my horizons and changed my perspectives on what are truly the best methods for learning. Sacrificing common activities in high school can be a challenge and making an extreme schooling transition can seem impossible, but throughout the process, valuable life lessons are learned. Taking the leap taught me how to adapt to changes, welcome changes and appreciate changes. Taking a chance and entering an alternative learning program can be frightening. The cost of early education can add up, especially if you have more than one child, but some help is available for those struggling to pay pre-school fees. Various forms of pre-school early education classes are available for children aged under five year olds, and mostly from the age of three or four years.</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">Not only does it help them learn to interact with their peers and develop social skills, but it also builds on all their existing skills and knowledge and helps give them a good start in life.

The Working Tax Credit is available for anyone who's on a low income and works for at least 16 hours a week (it's also available to those who worked at least 16 hours a week before going on maternity leave or before sick leave). The Pros and Cons of Alternative Learning Programs The innovative methods of teaching they offer tend to have a disregarded presence within the mainstream mix of private, public, Montessori, and boarding schools. A typical school set-up consists of long days, tons of tests, and loads of homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">In any form of schooling, learning is not limited to the classroom. Students further their experiences by pursuing outside interests like clubs, sports or volunteer work. It is not an easy choice to enter into an alternative learning program. Today, Maria Reed Montessori Pre-School (renamed in 1981 after its founder) continues to be the most economically feasible private Montessori preschool in the state. Each year the school serves a class of only 34 children in a modest building located in the center of downtown Phoenix at 909 N. 1st Street.

Enrichment Programs: Overland Park, KS Montessori School</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">11100 W 135th Street Overland Park, KS 66221 My name is Dena and I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about myself and Blue Valley Montessori. I was introduced to the Montessori philosophy while studying abroad and upon returning to the States in August of 2000, I became the Director of Blue Valley Montessori School. I have been with Montessori for ten years and have my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. I take pride in our school and have high expectations for the quality of care we offer our families. We strive to provide a loving and consistent environment for our students - from 2 1/2 year olds to fully potty trained children 6 years and under - while placing an emphasis on academic excellence. Many of our staff members have been part of the school for the past decade.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">They are dedicated and talented individuals, who truly care about each and every one of our students. We participate in continuing education classes to ensure we are providing the best program around.

Our teachers are certified professionals who have been trained in the methods and philosophies developed by Dr. Maria Montessori over 100 years ago. My family loves Blue Valley Montessori because they are like an extension of our own family. The teachers and staff are all very professional and absolutely the best! They have provided a tremendous environment that promotes not only a love of learning, but also a great sense of pride and self-esteem, as well as kindness and compassion for others. I would absolutely recommend Montessori to anyone that is looking for more than ABC's &amp; 123's for their child's education. - Lara S.</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">It has been amazing to watch our little girl grow throughout this past school year. We know when we drop our daughter off at school, she is not only learning, but she is in good hands. Montessori offers strong academics for a brilliant future combined with a loving, caring staff. - Patrica O. We are very impressed and happy with the entire experience at Blue Valley Montessori. We love the facility inside and out. It is very clean, bright, organized, and full of educational resources for our son and the other children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">His growth in the past three months has been outstanding. - Melissa J. Most parents do not understand value and are too one-dimensional to see beyond the price of tuition. Blue Valley Montessori provides value! Over the past nine months, my four year old son has learned to read, spell, and add very well. In addition, his manners and discipline have improved considerably. Because of these core skills, he will excel in public elementary school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">"This new program will provide families and students with a unique alternative to traditional education," Kari Headington, Director of the Hollis Montessori School said. Here, we believe that a Montessori education is second to none when it comes to helping children be life long learners. Our programs offer exploration and learning in math, language, science, history, geography, botany, practical life, sensorial and art areas. And our amazing team of teachers has more than 80 years of combined experience. They are committed to our students, parents and our school. Our students receive a high-quality learning experience in a prepared, school setting ... and they have fun and develop their social skills. We are committed to helping our students become independent, confident, self-disciplined and life long learners.</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">We offer an authentic Montessori education and our program closely adheres to Dr. Maria Montessori's philosophy and beliefs. We place a strong emphasis on parent involvement and encourage them to participate in many ways, including assisting with cooking and art projects, or helping with sounds and listening to the children read during class. Parents also attend various community and school events including our Fall Festival to benefit the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a school picnic, graduation and special Mother's Day and Father's Day events. Our school is large and well-equipped with eight primary classrooms. We have a large playground with age-appropriate climbing equipment, a shaded picnic area and lots of grass. Each multi-aged classroom community is a carefully prepared environment with a complete set of materials necessary for an authentic Montessori education. Children are encouraged to select activities they are interested in, and advance based on skill level, not age.</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">Our school has an international feel, as we have both staff and families from around the world. Since our son started here, his independence and confidence have sky rocketed. There is no way that any other child care program could ever provide the level of activities, learning, and skills that Montessori provides. The teachers are the guides and the children are the leaders of their unlimited potential. By the end of the school year, he knew more words in English than he did in Spanish. He is now reading and writing, and this is attributed to the best teaching staff I have ever known. The teachers and staff are very friendly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">The school not only supplies strong academic education, but also develops little ones' skills, such as social, behavior, communication, and how to raise questions. Montessori teachers are committed to teach the kids independence to educate them, and to keep them busy and interested. They are high quality, driven teaches. Montessori also offers flexible hours of operation for working parents, as well as a variety of extra-curricular activities. Using both creative and physical play, early education sessions will help young children learn new skills, gain new experiences, learn to build relationships and socialise with other children. Montessori is both a teaching method and a type of private school. Some public schools have Montessori classrooms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">The basis of her method is that the pace of student learning is as variable as the student. In Montessori schools and classrooms students are grouped according to age. The varying ages within a group allows each child to learn at their own pace. In addition, it allows each child to teach another. Free Range Learning Classrooms are set up to accommodate learning centers for each subject. Students can move freely around the room, working first on one subject and then moving on to the next.</paragraph><paragraph parID="124">In the course of a school day the student will spend time on every subject. Interwoven Learning Modules Rather than teaching subjects in isolation, the Montessori method takes a theme for the day or the week and explores that theme through history, math, science, music, reading and writing. This method allows the student to have a greater understanding of the topic. No Grades In Montessori schools and classrooms there are no grades. Learning is measured by the student's portfolio of work and the teacher's observations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="125">According to recent statistics students taught using the Montessori method score above average on standardized tests and perform well in college and life. Some groups will look only at academics or classroom dynamics, but others will also ensure that a school is viable in terms of finances and governance. "Schools join professional organizations for support, but also for accountability to themselves, each other and their parents," said Katherine Poyntz, executive director of the Canadian Council of Montessori Administrators. In provinces like British Columbia, where private schools receive some public funding, they are subject to province-wide testing. When available, parents should look at a school's scores over time, identify red flags like low or highly variable scores and ask school leaders why they might exist, said Peter Cowley, an education policy researcher at the Fraser Institute. Some schools might have low scores because they focus on students with learning disabilities, or variable scores might reflect a relocation, tragic event or other phenomena worth knowing about, he said. But in some provinces, like Ontario, most private schools don't participate in testing, and, even when they are available, these scores provide limited insight.</paragraph><paragraph parID="126">"They don't speak to whether [a school has] a good fine arts program, it doesn't speak to whether they encourage their kids to get involved in sports ... it doesn't speak to whether the school builds good citizens." The need Parents, teachers and administrators at Walden Green Montessori - one of the area's first public charter schools - were up to their white boards on how to finish off their new elementary school. Nestled in woodlands and dune grass just a mile from Lake Michigan, the newly constructed school resembled a design studio more than a mid-20th century "progressive" brick building. What types of space, colors and lighting encourage learning for Internet-savvy first graders? Would 1950s-style, all-in-one desks and chairs with tablet arms make the grade for "tweens", who collaborate constantly through cell phones, IMs and texting? Instructors wanted the ability to form small groups for team lessons - but also needed flexibility for individualized learning. After debating the pros and cons, school leaders chose the cool, affordable attitude of izzydesign.</paragraph><paragraph parID="127">The order of collaborative school tables and mobile seating was a real test for izzy, a company more accustomed to equipping people in The New Workstyles rather than children in grades K-8 - but we studied hard to get the students A+ results! izzy's Solution As they say, everything you need to know, you learned in kindergarten. Fortunately, you also can pick up a few tips from the super-smart Walden Green students, who taught us that what goes up could come down. So izzy scaled down its colorfully edged, 32-inch-high tables to fit the needs of the next generation. Now, kindergarten and first grade students enjoy working at izzy tables measuring only 21 inches high, while growing second, third and fourth graders move up to a personalized 25 to 26-inch-high table. Older students and visiting parents can change table height as needed by simply adjusting the standard pin-set table legs. To cross the t's and dot the i's, the izzy design team made sure the result was ergonomically correct.</paragraph><paragraph parID="128">"We learned so much, too," says Lauren Applin, izzy's Design Support Specialist. "It was so much fun to see the younger kids push the Clara diamond tables together to talk to their friends and work on projects - just like their parents would collaborate in an office." Against the cinder block walls, finished cement floors and natural materials, izzy furniture and seating adds splashes of color. "That includes izzy's pastel-colored Hannah chairs for the upper level classes, which the students just love," says Lauren. The waterfall back and seat design looks cool, and encourages students to move around, to sit in several different ways to stay comfortable. Due to their versatility, Hannah chairs are found throughout the school - in common areas, the eighth grade classroom - even the teachers' lounge! Thomas Hicks - School Leader, Walden Green Montessori Elementary School "The design of izzy's furniture is very conducive to Montessori habits, which reflect the adult work environment - kids working in small groups and individually outside of the classroom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="129">The different shapes of furniture appealed to us - square, round, and other geometric shapes - and how they fit together for team projects. The colors on the chairs and edge bands are important because they give color to the building, which is mostly gray and neutrals. We've received such good feedback from the kids on the space. The building is architecturally distinctive and the furniture is cool, too. It's not your average everyday thing. The chairs are funky, cool, in different colors. The teachers love it, too.</paragraph><paragraph parID="130">We just took a chance on it, knowing how our kids work, and brainstormed with izzy to choose the solution. I've never done anything like this before, but I'm very interested in furniture and design. Working with the team at izzy was fun because they're excited about things and it was new to them. It worked out even better than I expected. The furniture is simple, really functional. Kristin Dorais - Senior Interior Designer, Integrated Architecture "Our objective was to support the school's mission: to educate each child to his or her full human potential. In doing so, we strove to provide a solution that was innovative, affordable and sustainable.</paragraph><paragraph parID="131">By designing the school to be built right into the wooded site, we saved a lot of trees and kept the environment open and energetic. We specified 'learning colors' - a color palette and shapes that are appropriate for Montessori learning. They ranged from more primary for the younger children as well as more refined colors for the older grades. The izzy colors worked well within the palette we chose, and added more life to the space. The Clara tables and Hannah chairs provided a nice homey, warm feeling. The scale of it works; the color of it works - right down to the circular cutouts in the Hannah chairs. They blend right into the Montessori philosophy of teaching with shapes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="132">Best of all, izzy worked with the administrators and parents on a very affordable price. Otherwise, parents would have had to make the furniture. Some schools offer parent/infant classes, in which parents learn to observe their child and meet his needs in the Montessori way. More than 4,000 Montessori schools dot the American landscape, offering a unique educational model to families nationwide. Montessori schools can be found in rural, urban, and suburban settings; in working-class towns, affluent communities, and even remote villages. Some schools offer all levels of learning, from infant/toddler through the secondary (high school) level. Others offer only certain levels.</paragraph><paragraph parID="133">A growing number, however, are part of public school systems, making it possible for families of any means to give their child a Montessori education. It may be housed in a small, homelike setting, on an expansive campus, or surrounded by gardens that hold discoveries for every age. Individual schools may be part of a larger entity, often a nonprofit agency or religious institution. Like other private schools, most independently owned Montessori schools are funded by tuition revenue. Some schools provide scholarships for families in need of assistance, and many offer reduced tuition when parents enroll more than one child. Some share a facility with other programs that have a different instructional approach. In planning an age-appropriate Montessori curriculum, they need to make sure it matches their state's grade-level standards.</paragraph><paragraph parID="134">Public Montessori school students must take the same standardized tests as students in traditional public schools. Any school can call itself Montessori, and programs vary in how they interpret and practice the Montessori approach. mixed-aged classes, in which older children serve as role models and helpers; a full array of developmentally appropriate Montessori learning materials; teachers with credentials from a Montessori teacher education program; adherence to the Montessori instructional approach, with teachers serving as guides rather than givers of information. The Montessori manipulable materials are specifically designed to enhance the child's natural love of learning along with a program led by well trained, devoted teachers facilitating growth on every level.</paragraph><paragraph parID="135">A balanced curriculum of academics as well as music, art, gymnastics, cultural studies and character development help promote a well-rounded individual who has the highest potential to excel in every area of life. Carmel Valley Montessori School is based upon the philosophy of Maria Montessori providing a positive environment for growth and learning; offering experiences that enrich and enhance each child's cognitive, language, social, emotional, physical, creative and moral development. In a spirit of love and respect our teachers are responsive to each child's individual needs. Children have opportunities to create, explore the environment, learn problem solving and personal interaction skills, and learn concepts through hands-on experiences at their own pace and interest level. This fosters independence, positive self-concept and enhances the child's natural love of learning. A core curriculum of math, language, science, geography, reading, arts and crafts, music, gymnastics, cultural studies, and character development. At the heart of this approach is the belief that children will best reach their potential by having the freedom to learn in a classroom especially prepared for exploring under the careful guidance of a trained teacher.</paragraph><paragraph parID="136">Provides individual instruction: Each child is allowed supervised free choice of classroom activities and freedom of movement based on his or her interests, so long as these activities do not disrupt the well-being of the class. Promotes initiative and self-confidence: Materials are structured and presented to enable self-teaching and independent activity, which develops self-reliance. Emphasizes learning through the use of tangible sensory objects, which reinforces memory and understanding. Provides a supportive, carefully prepared environment scaled to the needs of the child and designed to teach a sense of responsibility and self-discipline. Our Montessori Schools provides a nurturing, child-centered environment where individual needs are met at each stage of development. Since its formation in 1960, the American Montessori Society has been the mainstay of the Montessori movement in the United States. AMS is a non-profit, non-discriminatory service organization committed to promoting quality Montessori education for all children from birth to 18 years of age.</paragraph><paragraph parID="137">"Montessori" is a developmentally appropriate approach to learning, originally designed by Dr. Maria Montessori early in this century. Its successful application with children from families of all social strata and special needs continues to attract widespread interest and support. The Montessori helps in knowledge development of the children through interesting games and activities and makes the learning process easier and pleasurable for them. Montessori education is always a priority in a child's life to build and shape his/her future and channelise the energy into positive direction. Montessori Method provides an enriched environment for the students with intellectual stimulation and plenty of opportunity for socialization. With the growing competition, the Montessori schools are improving their standard and quality by means of taking qualified and certified teachers to commit to the cause of educating children. A proper Montessori training program instructs and prepares a would-be teacher for inspiring and supporting children to become strong, successful and efficient in future.</paragraph><paragraph parID="138">Under the guidance of a teacher who has experienced Montessori training, children learn to explore independently and acquire self-discipline and concentration easily. Montessori curriculum, Montessori education, Montessori kindergarten, Montessori materials, Montessori method, Montessori preschool, Montessori schools, Montessori teacher, Montessori teacher education, Montessori teaching A Montessori is a learning shelter for the kids or children who are taught various activities in the class and its relation in real life. The key responsibilities of a Montessori are to monitor and guide children by watching over the environment and making it obstacle free. A Montessori curriculum revolves around guiding the inner nature of children and advocates freedom of self-directed learning amongst them. A compact and systematically designed Montessori curriculum involves learning through physical senses and helps in forming personality at basic level followed by developing imaginative skills, teaching social interaction before leading to adolescent growth. Due to the growing importance of Montessori education, more and more schools are cropping up to train and educate candidates to become pre &amp; primary / Montessori teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">Montessori jobs are in great demand in Asia, presently, especially in India. In Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, especially, to name a few cities, a whopping increase in the number of would-be Montessori teachers can be seen, due to the wide opportunities available in the field of Montessori jobs in these cities. The Montessori kindergarten works towards the betterment of a child's future with an approach that helps a child's cognitive, neurological and emotional development, based on research of many years. Montessori Method is a dynamic children's program, framed and practiced by the Montessori teachers and is intended to observe and meet the physical, mental, spiritual and emotional needs of children on a daily basis. The Montessori Method should be designed in such a way so that the children derive the enthusiasm and urge to learn, create, help and care for their environment and for others. A good Montessori preschool will provide supportive environment for children, make studies more interesting and vibrant by means of its strategic Montessori Method and enable the child to become independent. Hence it is very important for a Montessori teacher to be properly trained and qualified which would enable her to manipulate the environment and lessons to best fit the needs of their child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">Montessori teacher education is of utmost importance in training a would-be teacher systematically so that he/she inculcates the right teaching skills and methodologies to teach Montessori school children in future. The Montessori teacher education helps in forming a teacher as the directress by instilling in her classroom management techniques and classroom environment manipulations leading to the productive upbringing of children. More and more candidates are becoming interested in Montessori teaching in India which leading to a huge growth and success of the Montessori system. A proper Montessori teaching is based on an all-inclusive educational procedure from a child's birth till adulthood, observing the child's needs in a variety of environmental conditions. A Brief History of Montessori How has Montessori spread around the world since the opening of the first Montessori class in 1907 ? Growth in Europe and Spread to the Rest of the World</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">In the first Montessori 'casa dei bambini' or 'children's house' in San Lorenzo, Rome, Italy Dr Montessori trialled many materials and activities, but kept only those to which the children were spontaneously and repeatedly drawn. In this way the Montessori 'method' developed and grew purely on the basis of what the children showed her about themselves. By providing an environment with structure and activities that met the interest and needs of the children and by giving them freedom to move and act within it, it was said that Dr Montessori had revealed the "true nature" of the child. Children taught themselves! A second Casa dei Bambini opened in San Lorenzo on April 7 and a third in Milan on October 18, 1908. On November 4 1908 a Casa dei Bambini opened in a modern building for the middle classes in Prati di Castello, Rome. It was soon discovered that all children, whether from economically deprived or privileged backgrounds were capable of achieving and becoming independent learners when taught using Dr Montessori's methods.</paragraph><paragraph parID="142">The news about the 'miracle children' spread rapidly and many important dignataries and people from many parts of the world came to see the successful and stimulating teaching and learning taking place in the Children's Houses. One of the first New Zealanders to discover Montessori was a Miss Newman, a lecturer from Auckland Teachers' College, who visited the Casa dei Bambini in Rome in 1910. People were inspired by what they saw and conveyed the work when they returned to their homes. In this way, the Montessori movement spread all over the world. Montessori Publications and Courses In the years that followed, Dr Montessori travelled extensively, giving lecture and training courses in England, Spain, Australia, the Netherlands, India, Pakistan and the Americas. The Montessori method was endorsed and financially backed by people such as Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Sigmund and Anna Freud, Gandhi and Piaget.</paragraph><paragraph parID="143">The Absorbent Mind was published only three years before her death, and the insights in this book about the development of children and the importance of movement in learning are only now receiving recognition from academia as new brain research emerges. In the early years Montessori classes catered for children aged 3-6 years. Schools for 6-12 year olds soon followed, and in the late 1930s, Dr Montessori gave guidelines for the education of the adolescent and after World War Two for the infant and toddler.Her son, Mario Montessori, worked until his death in 1982 on the maturing of the 6-12 cosmic curriculum and the adolescent programme. The Montessori movement has had periods of flourishing and decline. In many countries, wars or changes in the cultural or education climate have halted or changed its course. Sooner or later it has always reappeared. In the United States there was intense interest in the Montessori method from 1913 until the 1920s.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">the progressive education movement led by Dr John Dewey had a significant effect on the decline of Montessori schools, as did the change in focus of American education from child-centred to skills focus during the Depression and World War II. By the late 1950s only a handful of schools existed in the USA. In 1969, the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) supported Nancy McCormick Rambusch to organise a branch in the USA. She later founded the American Montessori Society and established teacher training in Connecticut. This led to a revival of Montessori in the USA and today there are more than 4000 schools. Dr Montessori created Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) in 1929 to structure to her work and to ensure that it would be perpetuated after her death. AMI was then led by Mario and focused on establishing permanent Montessori centre for training teachers and trainer to continue the work of the centres.</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">Teachers carried the idea of Montessori back to their own countries and many national associations and training courses evolved independently. "Since the death of Mario in 1982, the expansion of Montessori endeavours has grown to a frenzy of inchoate proliferation, a global cacophony, deafening as the sound of a huge orchestra tuning its instruments." says Dr Montessori's grand-daughter, Renilde Montessori. Through her observations and work she discovered the children's astonishing, almost effortless ability to learn. In 1909 the first Montessori training course was given and Dr Montessori's first account of the work, The Montessori Method was published in Italian, appearing in English in 1912. Dr Montessori first visited the United States in 1912 and by 1913 there were almost 100 Montessori schools in the USA. In Switzerland, one of the most important 20the century theorist in child development, Jean Piaget, was influenced by Montessori and served as head of the Swiss Montessori Society.</paragraph><paragraph parID="146">A Montessori school is different from other schools in the following ways: The philosophy of education in a Montessori school is based on the educational philosophy of Dr. Maria Montessori. This philosophy is reflected in the qualifications of the teachers, the written curriculum, and the instructional methods, materials, and equipment used to implement the educational program. b. Teachers in Montessori schools must hold a Montessori teacher credential evidencing successful completion of all academic course work, student internship, and all other requirements established by a Montessori teacher training program in addition to a Bachelor's degree or 120 semester hours of college credit. The content of the educational program of a Montessori school will include English-language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies appropriate to the age or grade level of enrolled students. However, it will also include some areas of study specific to the Montessori educational philosophy. d. Montessori instructional materials and equipment must be provided to implement each curricular area.</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">e. Montessori instructional methods, techniques, and procedures must be used to implement the educational program. Further information about (a-e) above can be obtained from the American Montessori Society (AMS) or the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) whose phone numbers and addresses are listed in 3 below. Montessori is an approach to education with the fundamental belief that a child learns best within a social environment that supports and respects each individual's unique development. Montessori education is characterized by multi-age classrooms, a special set of educational materials, student-chosen work in long time blocks, a collaborative environment with student mentors, absence of grades and tests, and individual and small group instruction in academic and social skills. A number of the innovative entrepreneurs also went to Montessori schools, where they learned to follow their curiosity." Montessori education shapes the learner. This is not about skills or information or test scores.</paragraph><paragraph parID="148">It is about the formation of personal traits: the way we learn shapes us. Dr. Angeline Lillard , professor of psychology at the University of Virginia, has been studying Montessori's methods for more than two decades. Order Dr. Lillard's  best-selling book Montessori: The Science behind the Genius. "There's a sense of collaboration amongst Montessori students as opposed to competition." "Montessori can actually include children as young as 18 months old and go all the way up to Grade eight or even into high school," explains Katherine Poyntz, executive director of the Canadian Council of Montessori Administrators, a Toronto-based non-profit organization that promotes standards of excellence for Montessori educators in Canada. Ms. Poyntz also notes two opposing but similarly mistaken schools of thought on Montessori, with one side thinking Montessori schools are too structured and the other complaining that they aren't structured enough. "In fact, Montessori provides a structured environment," says Ms. Poyntz.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">"But within that structure, there's a lot of freedom." Delivered in a non-graded class made up of children of mixed ages, Montessori education lets children learn at their own pace according to their own choice of activities. Children learn through all five senses, in work centres organized by subject areas. "Montessori provides a dynamic community that recognizes that learning is a social process and gives opportunities for older children to mentor younger ones and for younger students to be inspired by the older kids," says Ms. Poyntz. The Montessori method calls for uninterrupted work periods lasting from one to three hours. In keeping with the tactile approach to learning, children work with objects fashioned from materials such as wood, glass and ceramic. Sarah Gatiss-Brown, administrator at the Westside Montessori Academy in Vancouver, points out that different schools vary in their interpretation of the Montessori method; some are "pure" schools and include only Montessori materials and staff who are trained by the Association Montessori Internationale, the global institute founded in 1929 by Dr. Montessori.</paragraph><paragraph parID="150">Other schools offer the Montessori curriculum mixed in with other activities. Ms. Poyntz says parents should also ask the school of it is accredited by organizations such as the CCMA. The Montessori method of teaching was developed by an Italian physician, Dr. Maria Montessori, in 1907 and utilizes a comprehensive approach that allows children to proceed at their own pace and focuses on all aspects of human development-intellectual, social, emotional, physical, and spiritual-to make learning an exciting process of discovery. "We are excited to offer this program to students in the Archdiocese because of its track record of success in educating today's student and because it gives Catholic parents who desire both a Catholic and Montessori education for their child, a great option," Archbishop O'Brien said. "The school is a dynamic educational environment and this additional program will be very attractive to young families." "The Montessori approach to education offers children a unique learning experience very much in keeping with Loyola's focus on educating the whole person, and we are very pleased St. Pius, a well-regarded school, is interested in incorporating the Montessori approach into its learning environment. "This partnership is a ground-breaking opportunity for us to not only enrich the school with a Montessori approach, but to create the kind of professional learning community that could lead the way in demonstrating how to revitalize schools through collaborative engagement, spiritual focus, and capacity building."</paragraph><paragraph parID="151">A certified Montessori teacher, assisted by a trained teacher assistant, is present to observe and present new activities to children as they demonstrate their need and readiness. The Catholic faith formation component of the program allows children to learn about the Catholic liturgy and Holy Scripture. Concern has been raised in some areas though that there's a bit too much emphasis placed on what children should be able to do at certain ages, rather than on the simple act of playing. Whilst it's certainly good to have a framework of learning in place, there is the temptation for parents to start worrying too soon that their children hasn't yet achieved certain goals, when really they're likely to pick them up soon in their own time. There's also the issue of parent pressure in some cases, too. It's definitely a good thing for children to get the chance to learn new activities and gain new skills, but building their schedule up so that they're busy almost all the time, with little time to just relax and play, is rather excessive and could, as was discovered in Bertie's case, lead to a child beginning to rebel over their pressured environment. MY name is Lisa Morse and I joined Bethany Village as the director with close to 15 years Montessori teaching experience as well as strong management and leadership background.</paragraph><paragraph parID="152">I love being a director because I am able to develop long-term relationships with families, as well as watch their children grow and blossom under the guidance of our accredited Montessori Toddler and Primary Guides.

Her bright smile tells me tat she loves to spend her day here, and she truly loves Ms. Carrie! The school is always quiet, calm, and the environment is cohesive to learning. At Colleyville Montessori, our parents are encouraged to participate in many different aspects of their child's Montessori education and we always have an open door policy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">Our classrooms are full of primary Montessori materials and you can be confident you're your child will be receiving a quality education. Since that time, we have developed a great reputation in the Colleyville community. Many of our families have been referred to our school by other parents, and some travel quite a distance just to be a part of our school. Our teachers have more than 50 years of combined experience in Montessori classrooms, and all of them have 5-10 years specifically at our school. Several of our teachers speak fluent Spanish and incorporate this into the Montessori classroom experience. Our parents have said that after visiting our school, they decided to enroll because of the warm feeling they got and that they were impressed seeing the children working together. Colleyville Montessori is recognized by the American Montessori Society.</paragraph><paragraph parID="158">Our large classrooms have large windows that brighten up the already visually and academically enriched classroom. We have a playground with soft surface covering and a shade structured picnic area with tables. We have great relationships with our families - which is why they continue to refer us to friends - and provide a warm, nurturing environment every day. Our toddler teachers are very popular with our families and always share information about the child's day and total progress. Primary Program: Our mixed-age primary classrooms are designed for children ages 3-6. It is unique because the children stay with their teacher for three years. This really creates a "family" inside the classroom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="159">We have little ones who are experiencing for the first time the freedom of choice in an environment scientifically designed to stimulate their every sense. The older children find pride and self-confidence in their completed work and take leadership and responsibility positions within the classroom, which we call the village. We offer parents the convenience of supplemental programs throughout the year after our academic day is finished. Our classrooms are unique because we create a family atmosphere where children have the freedom to learn and play while learning! "My vision of the future is no longer people taking exams and proceeding then on that certification . . . but of individuals passing from one stage of independence to a higher [one], by means of their own activity through their own effort of will, which constitutes the inner evolution of the individual." Over one hundred years after the first Montessori classroom opened in the slums of Rome, Montessori programs continue to enjoy a degree of popularity in both the private and public sectors unmatched by any other specialized approach to education. The main goal of the Montessori approach is to contribute to the enhancement of life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="160">It has evolved from observations of children from around the world, and addresses the needs of gifted children as well as special needs children for whom it was originally designed. It is an integrated, interdisciplinary, holistic system of education that evolved from the work of Dr. Maria Montessori, a visionary, who developed an approach to learning that, is capable of addressing many of today's educational, environmental, and social concerns. Her observations and research lead her to the philosophical belief that the child had the ability to offer civilization the opportunity to revitalize itself. She saw education as an aid to life that works best when it takes into consideration the developmental needs of the whole child. Early in the twentieth century, Maria Montessori developed educational materials and methods based on years of her research, which showed that children learn best by doing, not by passively accepting other people's ideas and pre-existing knowledge. The power of the Montessori teaching approach has been proven by modern research to enhance performance, interest, persistence, memory, and creativity in learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="161">To foster competent, responsible, adaptive citizens who are lifelong learners and problem solvers To promote learning in an inquiring, cooperative, nurturing atmosphere through self and teacher initiated experiences To support learning through the senses, by manipulating materials and interacting with other, leading to the abstract understanding of ideas To consider the individual as a whole: physical, emotional, social, aesthetic, spiritual and cognitive needs and interests are inseparable The Montessori Method is dynamic in that observation and the meeting of needs is continual and specific for each child. While many aspects of the Montessori method have now been incorporated into teaching programs throughout the world, Montessori is an educational philosophy and is not associated with a single organization. As a result of this, schools using the name Montessori can be vastly different.</paragraph><paragraph parID="162">Key Goals of a Montessori Education* Montessori students do not generally sit as a group and listen to a teacher, or use standard text books, rather they are involved in group and individual activities, and with the materials they have been given. Montessori The Montessori teaching method was founded by Dr. Maria Montessori, the first female physician in Italy, in 1907. The foundation of the method is based on the idea that children teach themselves and thrive in a prepared environment where they can choose from various activities that are developmentally appropriate. In this teaching method, children under the age of six learn through their senses by reading, observing, and listening, while children over the age of six learn to gather information, take field trips, do independent research, engage in the arts, and do group activities. An emphasis is placed on children learning at their own pace, rather than simply meeting a set standard of where the entire class should be. The focus in this teaching method is placed on learning through the discovery process, which leads to increased self-discipline, motivation, concentration, and fosters a love of learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="163">A con of this program that some cite is that it tends to keep parents at bay, which may leave them feeling left out of the educational process of their child. Today it is used in the U.S., as well as in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K, among other countries. Inquiry Based Inquiry Based learning is focused on seeking out information, truth, or knowledge. They are also encouraged through this route to conduct tests that may contradict their findings, as well as create and design models. The learning experiences that students engage in are generally open-ended, so there is not a single correct answer; rather they are encouraged to think of the possibilities that exist. Inquiry Based students adhere to standards that are pre-determined, but are active in learning through trial and error and careful reasoning. The focus is placed on inquiry, the students observing as scientists would, to learn through examination and thought-provoking experiences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="164">They are engaged in the learning and exploration process, carry out investigations, communicate their ideas, propose explanations, and raise questions. This teaching approach was first developed in the 1960s as an alternative approach to the weak method of simply having children try to memorize information. This approach places the emphasis on the learner and allows for in-depth investigation of what the students are learning, rather than having them adhere to a set of strict lesson plans. The students are encouraged to construct personally-meaningful projects that will help to get them motivated, maintain their interest, have more control over their learning experience, and be more responsible throughout the process. The projects often involve presentations, plays, poems, or other such opportunities, where the students demonstrate what they have learned. This method of learning embraces different learning styles, student interests, and diversity. PBL places an emphasis on learning groups, where students determine their project, and work together to accomplish their goals.</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">One of the cons of this program is that many find it difficult that a syllabus cannot be created in advance. Core Knowledge The Core Knowledge method was first introduced to schools in 1990, and is based on the idea that every democratic society must have people that have a common base of knowledge in order to function well. The idea is that, by having this common knowledge base, people will be able to function while also improving society. The core areas that students focus on include geography, world history, visual and music arts, language arts, and math. The program was designed to take about 50 percent of the total instruction time each day. Success for All The Success for All approach to teaching is an achievement-oriented program that focuses on elementary-aged children. The program was designed to intervene or prevent learning problems in the early years of a child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="166">The approach is centered on the beliefs that all children can learn, success in the early grades is essential for their future school progress, learning deficits can be prevented through intervention, and that effective school programs are both intensive and comprehensive. The program includes a 90-minute daily reading program, one-to-one tutoring, special education, eight week reading assessments, and children having a family support system that works with the child to ensure their success. Differentiated Instruction In Differentiated Instruction, the focus is placed on the fact that each student does not learn the same way. This method maximizes what a student learns by using flexible guidelines that aim to ensure that the students understand the material, rather than just covering as much material as possible. This approach offers options when it comes to taking in information, making sense of all the information, and for expressing what the student is learning. The foundation of this approach is based on the idea that the methods used in the classroom should be adapted according to the diverse student body it aims to serve. In order to truly adopt this method, however, schools are required to invest significant time into staff development, a con cited by some professionals who have considered this method as an option.</paragraph><paragraph parID="167">Love and Logic The Love and Logic approach to teaching focuses on allowing children to learn through the consequences of the mistakes they make, while putting the teachers in a position to feel more empowered and skilled while interacting with the students. The goals are to teach children to be responsible and prepare them to live in society, recognizing and making decisions about the various choices and consequences that exist within it. Professionals may question how viable this methodology would be in a variety of environments, such as in many inner cities where outside influences may interfere with the teachings within the schools. Waldorf The Waldorf teaching method was developed by the Australian philosopher Rudolph Steiner, with the first school focusing on it opening around 1919. The approach it takes is to emphasize the role that imagination plays in the child's education, while aiming to raise students that are moral and integrated. Within this methodology, those in early learning focus on imitative and sensory-based learning, while those in elementary school are focused on artistic expression. By adolescence, Waldorf places an emphasis on fostering abstract thought, judgment, and ethical thinking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="168">One of the cons of this program is that reading and writing are not introduced until age six or seven. Conclusion Deciding which teaching method to use is a complex decision, thanks to the variety of teaching methodologies, each having a number of proponents. Armed with the proper information, this decision is perhaps made easier in the context of each school, the unique student body guiding the way. It focuses attention on the whole child, considering not only the intellectual needs of the child, but the physical, social and emotional needs as well. The goal of the Montessori program is to lead each student to explore and understand the world and become active and accountable members of society. The Montessori curriculum presents an integrated, thematic approach that unifies the study of the physical universe, the world of nature, and the human experience. Literature, mathematics, the arts, writing, history, social studies, civics, economics and sciences all complement one another in the Montessori curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">The Montessori classroom is carefully designed to encourage the development of self-motivation in learning through diverse experiences that speak to the child&#65533;s imagination and need to discover. Lessons are introduced simply and concretely in the early years and are reinforced several times over the years at increasing degrees of abstraction and complexity. Students learn through manipulation of specially designed materials that enable them to form a sensorial impression before being introduced to concepts on a more abstract level. Students remain with the same teacher for two to three years, thereby strengthening the development of a strong sense of community with classmates and teachers. Learning to work and play together in a peaceful and caring community is one of the most important life skills that Montessori teaches. Through the study of diverse cultures, children come to appreciate and respect the contributions that others make to society. Clear and distinct guidelines, both in the classroom and throughout the school, offer children the structure which supports the development of self-motivation and responsible leadership.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">The highly trained Montessori staff understands the stages of child development and scope and sequence of the Montessori curriculum. Family involvement is an important part of every child&#65533;s learning. MONTESSORI ELEMENTARY SCHOOL bases its teaching method upon the work of Maria Montessori, an Italian educator and doctor. There are three different age levels in each classroom. Older children serve as models for younger children. They also reinforce their own skills by demonstrating lessons to the younger child, thus increasing self-confidence.

It also nurtures self-control and inner discipline. They discovered that Montessori children had higher levels of self-regulation and that it grew more consistently than it did in public school children. The study also revealed that Montessori children like their academic work of reading, math, geography and science much more strongly than their peers who tended to prefer cutting, coloring and playing. Montessori classrooms offer environments prepared with activities that correspond to internal development. When children are developmentally ready and are given opportunity and choice to use materials that correspond to their individual timetable of development, they proceed quickly and with great confidence and joy. They demonstrate concentration, keen interest and calmness in learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="178">Children with this kind of experience grow up loving to learn. There are beautifully designed Montessori schools all over the world. January 6, 2007 marked the 100th anniversary of the opening of the first Montessori school in Rome. Italy's first woman physician and surgeon, Maria Montessori called her first early childhood classroom a Children's House to celebrate the world's first child-sized tables, chairs and materials. As the world celebrated this centenary anniversary, Montessori schools throughout the world continue to offer prepared environments for children from infancy through high school. Montessori's ideas are even being successfully used with Alzheimer and stroke patients. "Free the child's potential and you will transform both the child and the world."</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">In the United States Montessori continues to grow and expand through private school, as well as significant numbers of public and charter Montessori schools in many states. A conservative estimate is that there are upwards of 25,000 Montessori schools in 110 countries serving more than a million children. Thousands more home school families also use Montessori. Perhaps it is to be found in the unique blend of successful academics plus a profound understanding of individual uniqueness and innate spiritual potential. She conceived of education more broadly than the conveyance of facts and figures. It is to help life. "Our care of the children should be governed not by the desire to 'make them learn things', but by the endeavor always to keep burning within them the light which is called intelligence."</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">She wrote: "I believe that the work of the educator consists primarily in protecting the [inner] powers and directing them without disturbing them in their expansion; and in the bringing of man into contact with the spirit which is within him and which should operate through him." In addition to academic pursuits, the Montessori curriculum includes problem solving and peace, in a direct response to her writing about helping children develop inner direction. This new way of thinking about education carries over to the preparation of teachers as well. "The training of the teacher who is to help life is something far more than the learning of ideas. It includes the training of character; it is a preparation of the spirit." Internationally recognized teacher preparation is available throughout the United States and throughout the world. A three-year study conducted by Lander University and the University of South Carolina focused on whether there is a difference between Montessori children and traditional public school children in self-regulation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">For example, nearly 100% of non-Montessori children will go tell the teacher when they experience disagreements between classmates, while 70% of Montessori children have learned skills to work it out and only 30% have to go to the teacher for help. Growing Montessori Movement The number of Montessori schools is growing world-wide as people come to understand and appreciate the value of Maria Montessoris approach.

Educating For Life 18 Months - 8th Grade Phone: (877) 2THE-HMS Our Accreditation The Hockessin Montessori School is accredited by the following agencies: *The American Montessori Society (AMS) *The Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary Schools *The International Montessori Council The Accreditation Process</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">How our school became accredited by the American Montessori Society (AMS), a nationally recognized school accrediting agency... First, The Self-Study - The AMS Accrediting Commission believes that students benefit from being in a school that knows itself thoroughly. AMS Accreditation is a voluntary process undertaken by school that are committed to continuous improvement. The first step is a rigorous self-study and documentation process that begins with the articulation of a philosophy of education and an analysis and description of the school community. This is followed by an appraisal of the school's offerings and a self-evaluation of the school's organization, personnel, facilities, and instruction. The process is one of discovery and the attainment of knowledge necessary for planning with confidence, and results in a strategic plan that fosters continuous school improvement. Second, An Objective Evaluation - The AMS Accrediting Commission believes that students benefit when their school undergoes objective evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">Having completed an accepted self-study, the school is visited and evaluated by a team of experienced educators named by AMS. The validators verify the findings of the self-study and offer evaluating judgments, both recommendations and commendations to the school community. Third, An Action Plan - The AMS Accrediting Commission believes that students benefit from being in a school that constantly strives for improvement. A school is required to provide a plan for its further development and improvement. A plan becomes strategic when it includes timelines, resources (both human and financial), and tools to measure success. Fourth, Accreditation - The AMS Accrediting Commission believes that students benefit if their school continues to be actively involved with other quality schools both to improve itself and to participate in the national movement to improve education. AMS Accreditation is granted if the self-study, evaluation, and planning reports reveal that the school meets the standards for accreditation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">During this time, through networking with other quality schools, periodic progress reporting, and participation in other school improvement events, accredited schools work toward their own improvement and the improvement of other schools. Fifth, Continous Evaluation - The AMS Accrediting Commission believes that a quality, accredited school must show stability and continuous improvement. AMS Accredited Schools submit an Annual Report to AMS, which documents continuing compliance with AMS Standards and reports on the status of the school's implementation of the strategic plan. Through Accreditation, The Hockessin Montessori School has met Standards for... *defining appropriate educational goals and providing educational programs to achieve them; *maintaining a qualified faculty and an effective school organization; *assessing outcomes of school experiences and controlling the quality of educational programs;</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">*responding to concerns of parents and needs of the school community; *providing for the continuity of its program and planning for their future; *describing with accuracy the content of its services and program; *developing plans and activities for continuous school improvement. Characteristics of an AMS Accredited School... It is devoted to a mission. The Hockessin Montessori S chool cares enough about what it does to seek validation by a recognized accrediting agency.</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">It knows itself. The Hockessin Montessori School operates from an examined vision of service to students, family, and community. It keeps its promises. AMS accreditation ensures that The Hockessin Montessori School is what it says it is and does what it says it does. It accepts objective evaluation. The Hockessin Montessori School invites validation from experienced educators who have no involvement with the school other than to provide annual and scheduled evaluations. It is recognized.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">The Hockessin Montessori School is accredited by a member of the  National Council for Private School Accreditation  and is listed as an accredited school in the international registry at www.accreditedschools.org . It is self-correcting. AMS accreditation begins with self-evaluation which results in a strategic plan that fosters continuing school improvement. It is student-oriented. The Hockessin Montessori School's philosophy of education expresses what it does for the whole student. The Hockessin Montessori School has plans that include continuoss strategies for anticipated events and goals toward even higher levels of quality and school improvement. It examines performance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">The Hockessin Montessori School continuously obtains and analyzes objective evidence on student achievement and growth. It participates in the responsibilities of the academic profession. A Montessori school assists this very natural process and removes the obstacles that the child may find in his path. The child is at the centre of the educational process, and the adult follows the child and helps him to help himself. A school often called a Montessori school when it is associated with young children or when it uses some of the Montessori materials but may not apply the principles of Montessori education. She believed that to offer the child this help, he must live in a specially prepared environment that answers all his needs - physical and spiritual. The Grade School Child and Homeschooling: A Guide to Help You Succeed</paragraph><paragraph parID="192">Perhaps the most important thing to remember when homeschooling a grade school child is to make sure that child has a strong foundation in reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, there are other valuable skills grade school children need to master as well. What do you need to do it successfully? The Decision to Bring (or Keep) Your Child at Home For some, the decision to homeschool was made long before children were even born. For others, the decision to homeschool may come about through a variety of experiences - the student was floundering in a school, there's a lack of quality schools nearby, or the parent learns more about homeschooling from a group in the area where he or she lives. When it comes to homeschooling, there is no one way to do it; there is a variety of methods to sort through, and everyone has advice - though this advice might not be sound.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">Because it can seem so daunting to get started on your own homeschooling journey, it's important to organize this advice into subject areas. No matter whether you are new at the homeschooling lifestyle or you're a seasoned teacher in your home classroom, we've got advice to help you get through the grade school years. Advice on Making the Decision Making the decision to homeschool is not something that should be taken on lightly. There are many different methods for homeschooling your children. You have to determine whether you've got what it takes to commit to homeschooling children. You also should carefully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of homeschooling to see whether it is something for you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">Once you've made the decision, it will be important to know how to talk to others about the decision you've made with confidence. Advice on Choosing a Method Classical, unschooling, Charlotte Mason, Montessori, Christian, school-at-home - which is the best method to use for homeschooling?

Advice on Grade School Socialization Prepare yourself: No matter how long you've been homeschooling there are going to be people who upon hearing about your educational choice will ask, "But aren't you worried about socialization?" If you're like many, and wondering how it is that bullying, access to drugs, and peer pressure are healthy forms of socializing your children, then you're not alone. There have been many studies performed investigating the best ways to socialize a homeschooled child - and many studies have found that homeschooled children are actually better and more confident in social exchanges than traditionally schooled peers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">Advice on Lesson Planning There's a group of different schools on how to plan your lessons for homeschooling.

It emphasises the need to integrate the curriculum - from mathematics to language, history, geography as well as the sciences: geology, zoology, botany, physics and chemistry and the newest field of Earth systems science. Art, music, drama and dance are blended into the curriculum as expressions of human creativity. The Montessori approach to life and learning combines freedom with responsibility, a more active role for the children in their learning and academic excellence based on each person's potential contribution. It also provides for social and moral awareness as well as the development of the whole personality. Respect for the children's personality and trust in their inner potentialities are prerequisite to the establishment of a healthy learning ambiance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">Montessori identifies the goal of education as the development of a complete human being, oriented to the environment, and adapted to his or her time, place and culture. Today we extend this by asking the children to question deeply in order develop personal integrity so they are ready to meet whatever life may bring. This form of learning enables children to see the whole in order to understand the details. Cultural historian and author of The Great Work , Thomas Berry says: 'Our educational institutions need to see their purpose not as training personnel for exploiting the Earth, but as guiding students toward an intimate relationship with the Earth... In this context we might consider the intellectual, political and economic orientations that will enable us to fulfill the historical assignment before us - to establish a more viable way into the future.' Matakana Primary School with a current role of around 340 children is a rural school that benefits from a tremendous community spirit. Much enthusiasm and many fundraising endeavours have enabled the school to develop additional facilities such as a school garden, orchard, all weather fitness track and adventure playground.

The class achieves the three hour work cycle in the morning and joins in with school wide activities where appropriate in the afternoon. For a child to be considered for the class a completed enrolment form must be received. At around age 41/2 an interview between the parents/caregivers, the child and the enrolment committee will take place for both parties to explore expectations and suitability. Upon acceptance of a place, parents will be asked for a development donation of $1100. I loved the idea of sending my son to an actual school rather than to a daycare. "My children have been attending Greatwood Montessori since they were 2 and a half years old.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">I have been very happy not only with the education that they have received, but also with the bonds that they have formed with their teachers, who care a great deal about the children they teach. I'm also happy with the friendliness of the staff, who always greet us with a friendly "hello. " Something that is also very important to me is the fact that the school takes very seriously the special circumstances of each child, especially life-threatening food allergies, which one of our children has. Knowing that my children are getting a quality education in a safe and friendly environment is why we have stayed at Greatwood Montessori for so many years. " Julie Sams Greatwood Montessori "I am extremely pleased with this school for my daughter.

" Stephanie Knoppe Greatwood Montessori</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">"We first met the staff at Greatwood Montessori when our daughter was 18-months-old. Our apprehension surrounding putting Gabby in school was quickly erased when we took a tour and found the staff to be highly educated, very caring and the facility secure and clean. There have been minimal staff changes and faces are familiar and friendly throughout the facility. Gabby has progressed from a shy toddler to a confident 3-year-old who loves to read books, count anything put in front of her, explore other cultures and play with her friends. We attribute her successes to the great teachers at Greatwood Montessori who truly excel at what they do. Gabby loves going to school each and every day and comes home weekly telling us something new she's learned. Thank you Greatwood Montessori!"</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">Jill and Greg Roach Greatwood Montessori "After a great deal of research, I decided to listen to the recommendations of several friends and enroll at Greatwood Montessori. It's been five months, and I am very pleased with my decision. My son enjoys all of the independence the school allows him. He is becoming far more self-sufficient than I even knew a 2-year-old could be. He also truly loves all of the employees, from the office staff, to his teachers, to the cook. The classrooms are always peaceful and organized and set up in such a way that even the smallest child can feel independent and successful.</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">At Greatwood Montessori my son has the chance to be himself and grow as an individual. He is developing his curiosity and confidence in a safe and loving environment." Currently, Monarch Montessori is a private school, however they recently applied to become a DPS charter school. The Montessori Method was designed with the idea that every child should be treated as an individual. In addition, the Method encourages a child's creative potential and supports his or her innate desire to learn. The goal of the Montessori Method was to allow self-direction and self-motivation to children in a progressive classroom atmosphere. In her method, children were neither punished nor rewarded for what they did in school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">After graduating from medical school in 1894, Maria Montessori began studying the educational problems of mentally handicapped children at the University of Rome's psychiatric clinic. She designed educational programs that assisted the classroom learning process by encouraging individual, rather than group, effort. Contemporary brain research confirms many of the innovative ideas that Maria Montessori had in 1907. Those listed on this site have welcomed the opportunity to make themselves available in this way. Of course there are many schools and teacher training centers not listed who may be very good.

Student Self-Evaluations: At the elementary level, students will often prepare a monthly self-evaluation of the past three month's work: what they accomplished, what they enjoyed the most, what they found most difficult, and what they would like to learn in the three months ahead. Portfolios of Student Work: In many Montessori schools, two or three times a year, teachers (and at the elementary level, students) and parents go through the students' completed work and make selections for their portfolios. Student/Parent/Teacher Conferences: Once the students' three-month self-evaluations are complete, parents, students, and teachers will hold a family conference two or three times a year to review their children's portfolios and self-evaluations and go through the teachers' assessment of their children's progress. Narrative Progress Reports: In many Montessori schools, once or twice a year, teachers prepare a written narrative report discussing each student's work, social development, and mastery of fundamental skills. How Do Montessori Schools Report Student Progress? Because Montessori believes in individually paced academic progress, most schools do not assign letter grades or rank students within each class according to their achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">Student progress, however, is measured in different ways, which may include: When completed, they will meet with the teachers, who will review it and add their comments and observations. The Montessori School of San Diego has a philosophy that isn't always talked about, but is still applicable and still as strongly practiced in the classrooms now as it always has been: "The Child Comes First." They are able to bring to the classroom something fresh each day, something from which the children can see and feel and grow. At times the situation can be trying as well as tiring, yet each time the Montessori teacher digs a little deeper for the patience and understanding of that one child who needs extra attention. This dedication of the Montessori teachers, especially of our teachers, is what makes the method applicable and so valuable. Once in a while we all need to remember that phrase and rededicate ourselves to the philosophy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">This is what sets aside good Montessori teachers from other teachers. They remember that each and every child needs and deserves respect. That is why a Montessori teacher will speak to the child in his/her class with respect and discipline is low-key. We have an excellent reputation and the administration will always strive to maintain it by employing only the best and most dedicated teachers. Among the 5-year-olds, Montessori students proved to be significantly better prepared for primary school in reading and math skills than the non-Montessori children. They also tested better on "executive function", the ability to adapt to changing and more complex problems, an indicator of future school and life success. Montessori children also displayed better abilities on the social and behavioral tests, demonstrating a greater sense of justice and fairness.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">And on the playground they were much more likely to engage in emotionally positive play with peers, and less likely to engage in rough play. Among the 12-year-olds from both groups, the Montessori children, in cognitive and academic measures, produced essays that were rated as "significantly more creative" and using "significantly more sophisticated sentence structures". The Montessori and non-Montessori students scored similarly on spelling, punctuation and grammar, and there was not much difference in academic skills related to reading and math.

According to a study reported in the September 29th issue of Science, Montessori educated children have better social and academic skills than children who attend traditional schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">The authors, Virginia University psychology professor Dr Angeline Lillard and former Wisconsin University graduate student Dr Nicole Else-Quest compared the outcomes of children at a public inner-city Montessori school with children at traditional schools. Children came from families of similar incomes and were evaluated at the end of the two most widely implemented levels of Montessori education: preschool (3-6 year-olds) and primary (6-12 year- olds). The children who attended the Montessori school, and the children who did not, were tested for their cognitive and academic skills, and for their social and behavioral skills. "We found significant advantages for the Montessori students in these tests for both age groups," Lillard said. "Particularly remarkable are the positive social effects of Montessori education. In social and behavioral measures, 12-year-old Montessori students were more likely to choose "positive assertive responses" for dealing with unpleasant social situations, such as having someone cut into a queue. They also indicated a "greater sense of community" at their school and felt that students there respected, helped and cared about each other.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">"When strictly implemented, Montessori education fosters social and academic skills that are equal or superior to those fostered by a pool of other types of schools," the authors concluded. Montessori is the single largest pedagogy in the world with more than 8000 schools worldwide. The success of the Japanese program at University Montessori has brought inquiries from non-Japanese families who want their children in language and cultural classes.

Observe at the school</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">Parents should observe at a school before selecting it for their child, preferably in the classroom their child will attend. Most Montessori schools welcome observers, and the children are accustomed to visitors. The visitor is typically directed to a chair where they sit and observe the entire room. Observations usually last thirty minutes to an hour, and allow the observer to get a feel for the room. Feel free to visit more than once; every day is unique!

Nestled on seven wooded acres in Ohio's historical Western Reserve Region, Hudson Montessori School was founded by a group of parents in 1962 as the 13th Montessori school established in the United States. Hudson Montessori is an independent coeducational day school serving 266 students in grades P-8, where 70 percent of the staff has participated in All Kinds of Minds professional development. "We were looking for a professional development program designed around current, research-based principles to help maximize the learning potential for each student -- one that would give us tools to support the individual learning needs of our students and one that would fit with and enhance our mission of fostering a Montessori educational environment conducive to each child's unique qualities and abilities," explains Julia Brown, Hudson Montessori's Head of School. "The All Kinds of Minds approach was the logical choice. The program's focus on student affinities and strengths dovetails perfectly with Montessori Method principles of building upon the child's interests and encouraging him/her to explore and discover, and helping the child develop confidence and self-esteem, a joy and enthusiasm for learning, and a sense of care and respect for others." The school's Educational Support Team (which includes a school psychologist, a speech &amp; language pathologist, and a reading/literary specialist) works to support faculty and staff in integrating All Kinds of Minds' principles throughout curriculum and school programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">"This program enables our entire faculty and staff to better understand the variations in all children's learning-not just that of struggling learners," adds Karen Lazar, Director of Development at Hudson Montessori School."The common language from All Kinds of Minds' neurodevelopmental framework empowers us to describe and identify strengths and understand breakdowns in student learning-not only among ourselves as a professional community, but also with students and parents."</paragraph></documents>
