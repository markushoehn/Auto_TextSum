  <paragraph parID="0">Sometimes kids feel like it's their own fault, that if they looked or acted differently it wouldn't be happening. Praise your child for being brave enough to talk about it. Emphasize that it's the bully who is behaving badly - not your child. Reassure your child that you will figure out what to do about it together. Sometimes an older sibling or friend can help deal with the situation. Each day, 10-year-old Seth asked his mom for more and more lunch money. Yet he seemed skinnier than ever and came home from school hungry.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">It turned out that Seth was handing his lunch money to a fifth-grader, who was threatening to beat him up if he didn't pay. But then she found out that one of them had posted mean rumors about her on a website. Kayla cried herself to sleep that night and started going to the nurse's office complaining of a stomachache to avoid the girls in study hall. Signs of Bullying Unless your child tells you about bullying - or has visible bruises or injuries - it can be difficult to figure out if it's happening. But there are some warning signs. Parents might notice kids acting differently or seeming anxious, or not eating, sleeping well, or doing the things they usually enjoy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">When kids seem moodier or more easily upset than usual, or when they start avoiding certain situations, like taking the bus to school, it might be because of a bully. If you suspect bullying but your child is reluctant to open up, find opportunities to bring up the issue in a more roundabout way. For instance, you might see a situation on a TV show and use it as a conversation starter, asking "What do you think of this?" or "What do you think that person should have done?" This might lead to questions like: "Have you ever seen this happen?" or "Have you ever experienced this?" You might want to talk about any experiences you or another family member had at that age.</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">Let your kids know that if they're being bullied - or see it happening to someone else - it's important to talk to someone about it, whether it's you, another adult (a teacher, school counselor, or family friend), or a sibling. Helping Kids Kayla, 13, thought things were going well at her new school, since all the popular girls were being so nice to her. Unfortunately, the kind of bullying that Seth and Kayla experienced is widespread. In national surveys, most kids and teens say that bullying happens at school. A bully can turn something like going to the bus stop or recess into a nightmare for kids. Bullying can leave deep emotional scars that last for life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">And in extreme situations, it can culminate in violent threats, property damage, or someone getting seriously hurt. If your child is being bullied, there are ways to help him or her cope with it on a day-to-day basis and lessen its lasting impact. And even if bullying isn't an issue right in your house right now, it's important to discuss it so your kids will be prepared if it does happen. What Is Bullying? Most kids have been teased by a sibling or a friend at some point. And it's not usually harmful when done in a playful, friendly, and mutual way, and both kids find it funny. But when teasing becomes hurtful, unkind, and constant, it crosses the line into bullying and needs to stop.</paragraph><paragraph parID="5">Bullying is intentional tormenting in physical, verbal, or psychological ways. It can range from hitting, shoving, name-calling, threats, and mocking to extorting money and treasured possessions. Some kids bully by shunning others and spreading rumors about them. Others use email, chat rooms, instant messages, social networking websites, and text messages to taunt others or hurt their feelings. It's important to take bullying seriously and not just brush it off as something that kids have to "tough out." The effects can be serious and affect kids' sense of self-worth and future relationships. In severe cases, bullying has contributed to tragedies, such as school shootings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="6">If your child tells you about a bully, focus on offering comfort and support, no matter how upset you are. Kids are often reluctant to tell adults about bullying because they feel embarrassed and ashamed that it's happening, or worry that their parents will be disappointed. Sometimes they're scared that if the bully finds out that they told, it will get worse. Others are worried that their parents won't believe them or do anything about it. Or kids worry that their parents will urge them to fight back when they're scared to. Remind your child that he or she isn't alone - a lot of people get bullied at some point. It may help your daughter to hear how the older sister she idolizes was teased about her braces and how she dealt with it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">An older sibling or friend also might be able to give you some perspective on what's happening at school, or wherever the bullying is happening, and help you figure out the best solution. Take it seriously if your hear that the bullying will get worse if the bully finds out that your child told. Sometimes it's useful to approach the bully's parents. In other cases, teachers or counselors are the best ones to contact first. If you've tried those methods and still want to speak to the bullying child's parents, it's best to do so in a context where a school official, such as a counselor, can mediate. Many states have bullying laws and policies. Find out about the laws in your community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="8">In certain cases, if you have serious concerns about your child's safety, you may need to contact legal authorities. Advice for Kids The key to helping kids is providing strategies that deal with bullying on an everyday basis and also help restore their self-esteem and regain a sense of dignity. It may be tempting to tell a kid to fight back. After all, you're angry that your child is suffering and maybe you were told to "stand up for yourself" when you were young. And you may worry that your child will continue to suffer at the hands of the bully. But it's important to advise kids not to respond to bullying by fighting or bullying back.</paragraph><paragraph parID="9">It can quickly escalate into violence, trouble, and someone getting injured. Instead, it's best to walk away from the situation, hang out with others, and tell an adult. Here are some other strategies to discuss with kids that can help improve the situation and make them feel better: Avoid the bully and use the buddy system. Use a different bathroom if a bully is nearby and don't go to your locker when there is nobody around. Make sure you have someone with you so that you're not alone with the bully. Buddy up with a friend on the bus, in the hallways, or at recess - wherever the bully is.</paragraph><paragraph parID="10">Offer to do the same for a friend. Hold the anger. It's natural to get upset by the bully, but that's what bullies thrive on. It makes them feel more powerful. Practice not reacting by crying or looking red or upset. It takes a lot of practice, but it's a useful skill for keeping off of a bully's radar. Sometimes kids find it useful to practice "cool down" strategies such as counting to 10, writing down their angry words, taking deep breaths or walking away.</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">Sometimes the best thing to do is to teach kids to wear a "poker face" until they are clear of any danger (smiling or laughing may provoke the bully). Act brave, walk away, and ignore the bully. Firmly and clearly tell the bully to stop, then walk away. Practice ways to ignore the hurtful remarks, like acting uninterested or texting someone on your cell phone. By ignoring the bully, you're showing that you don't care. Eventually, the bully will probably get bored with trying to bother you. Tell an adult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">Teachers, principals, parents, and lunchroom personnel at school can all help stop bullying. Talk about it. Talk to someone you trust, such as a guidance counselor, teacher, sibling, or friend. They may offer some helpful suggestions, and even if they can't fix the situation, it may help you feel a little less alone. Remove the incentives. If the bully is demanding your lunch money, start bringing your lunch. If he's trying to get your music player, don't bring it to school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">Reaching Out At home you can lessen the impact of the bullying. Encourage your kids to get together with friends that help build their confidence. Help them meet other kids by joining clubs or sports programs. And find activities that can help a child feel confident and strong. Maybe it's a self-defense class like karate or a movement or other gym class. And just remember: as upsetting as bullying can be for you and your family, lots of people and resources are available to help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">But you might not know how many other kids have felt exactly the same way. We were wondering what kids thought about this tough topic so we asked 1,229 boys and girls to answer some questions about bullying. every week, but not every day (7%) once in a while, but not every week (33%) The KidsPoll also asked how many of these kids were bullies themselves. 5% said they bullied others every week 15% said they bullied others every day</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">Fighting is also against the rules (both in and out of school), so the two kids could get in trouble even if the bully started the whole thing. The bully still gets the satisfaction of seeing the picked-on kid get really upset. Adults should take action to prevent bullying and discipline kids who are bullies. Grownups are important because they can discipline kids who are bullies, help kids who have been bullied to build their confidence and strength, and help kids who witness bullying to use their power to change things for the better. And when no one does anything, the bullied kid can feel worse and worse. In fact, 14% of the kids surveyed said being bullied can make them afraid to go to school. So what do kids do when they see someone being bullied?</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">There are many warning signs that may indicate that someone is affected by bullying-either being bullied or bullying others. Recognizing the warning signs is an important first step in taking action against bullying. Not all children who are bullied or are bullying others ask for help. It is important to talk with children who show signs of being bullied or bullying others. These warning signs can also point to other issues or problems, such as depression or substance abuse. Talking to the child can help identify the root of the problem. Statistics from the 2008-2009 School Crime Supplement show that an adult was notified in only about a third of bullying cases.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">Kids don't tell adults for many reasons: Bullying can make a child feel helpless. Kids may want to handle it on their own to feel in control again. They may fear being seen as weak or a tattletale. Kids may fear backlash from the kid who bullied them. Bullying can be a humiliating experience. Kids may not want adults to know what is being said about them, whether true or false.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">They may also fear that adults will judge them or punish them for being weak. Kids who are bullied may already feel socially isolated. They may feel like no one cares or could understand. Kids may fear being rejected by their peers. Friends can help protect kids from bullying, and kids can fear losing this support. If you have been bullied , you know how bad it feels. How often have you been bullied?</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">22% said they bullied others once in a while As you have probably guessed, some kids said they were both bullies and the victims of bullies. Well, some kids learn to bully because they have been subjected to mean, unfair treatment themselves - by others or by their families. The bully gets satisfaction (feels good) when he or she gets a reaction out of the person being bullied. Well, too many of them do nothing (16%) or join in (20%). But the rest of the kids are on the right track. They said they would say or do something to try and stop it (41%) or tell someone who could help (23%).</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">When kids tell an adult about a bully, it's a way of saying that bullying is not cool. Most kids (72%) already know this and said bullies are usually sort of un-cool or very un-cool. But 28% of kids said bullies are either sort of cool or very cool. Don't let bullies get this idea at your school. There are many different forms of bullying and it is important for everyone to know about them so that it can be recognized and dealt with when it comes up. Some bullies may use threats, insults or try to exclude a person out of the group of friends. Sometimes bullying may be very subtle, but it is still just as bad as the more obvious forms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that occurs through the Internet, phones, social media, IMs and other virtual means. Examples of cyberbullying include repeatedly contacting someone after they have stated that they want to be left alone, name-calling, posting mean comments about a person, altering their photos to intentionally make fun of them in a bad way, sending threats and so on. Very often, bullies act so mean because they are actually being bullied by other people. Starting a new year at school can be a lot of fun: there are new friends and teachers to look forward to, old friends to meet up with, and a whole new experience to enter. Sadly, all of this can easily fade into the background if bullying arises. Don't ever feel ashamed or scared of having to report an incident of bullying. Bullying, whatever the reason, is always wrong.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">There is always a way to deal with it, even if the situation may seem impossible. Read on through the rest of this article to learn how to spot the signs of bullying and how to protect yourself or friends from it. What is Bullying Bullying is a form of behavior that one or several people use to inflict mental or physical pain, discomfort or embarrassment upon someone else. Bullying can also be used as a way of exercising power. For example, a bully might order another person to do tasks for them that they should not normally be doing. Bullying happens with boys as well as girls.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">Some cyberbullies might even post as their victim, in order to get them into trouble. An important thing to remember is that victims are not entirely innocent. There are many instances in which cyberbully victims engage in cyberbulling against other people. There are many ways to tell when someone is trying to bul ly you. The most obvious are physical and verbal. If someone intentionally hurts you in a physical way or says mean things, those are both forms of bullying. Other types of bullying are more subtle, such as spreading rumors or leaving a person out of a group to make them feel bad.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">If you ever notice a sibling or friends with strange bruises or injuries or damage to their belongings, it may be a hint of bullying. They may also express it as a change in their behavior, such as having nightmares, avoiding school or becoming angry or depressed without any obvious reason. On the other hand, it is also important to recognize if you or someone you know is starting to act like a bully. Bullies tend to be aggressive with other people, especially those who are smaller or younger than them. Some bullies like to stick together in a group, and they may often be in detention. Very often, especially among girls, bullies will pretend to be a friend but then engage in peer pressure or indirect forms of bullying behind their backs. Bullying may have many different effects depending on the person.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">It most often results in the victim becoming increasingly afraid, withdrawn and even depressed. Bullying can even impact your health, studies and social life. This is one of the reasons why bullying should not be allowed to continue for any amount of time. Occasionally it may even have long-term effects in some people such as social insecurities or trouble with authoritative figures. One way to face bullying is to ignore it. Walk away and report the incident to a parent or teacher. Stick with your friends, since bullies find it harder to act badly towards a whole group of people as opposed to a single student.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">If you feel confident about the issue, perhaps have a calm talk with the bully. In trying to help them, you might be able to make them a better, happier person too. This makes them sad, angry or frustrated, and they in turn take out their emotions on kids who are not as strong as they are. Always remember that a good way to help stop bullying is to treat people with respect. It was a stunning moment, a vindication for the Khourys of the world - kids whose shy temperament, bookish nature or odd affect invites torment from kids void of empathy. And Ja'Mea, 17, is so abused on her long bus ride in Yazoo County, Mich., that she retaliates by threatening her tormenters with a loaded gun. Not so Tyler Long and Ty Smalley, who, their parents contend, said "No more" to bullying by committing suicide.</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">If kids don't feel safe or secure, the long range effects could mean serious depression, anxiety in social situations, fear in public, lack of trust... When I was a kid, 30-40 years ago, it was thought that bullying made kids stronger. Then Jackson gave him what every bullied child prays for: a promise of protection. He hopes to spark discussion about how to eliminate bullying, which director Hirsch says affects five million kids a year, making it "the most common form of violence young people in this country experience." Kelby, a 16-year-old lesbian in Tuttle, Okla., is bullied not just by classmates and sports teammates but by her teachers, community and church members. There is never an excuse for a child to be tormented because of who he or she is and as a people we need to take it seriously and stop it, for the sake of all children. Bullies need to see STRENGTH and their own PATHETIC WEAKNESS to feel SHAME so they try to become stronger, instead of just finding an even weaker victim. When a kid is being bullied, often times, other kids stand and watch.</paragraph><paragraph parID="28">If you felt like nobody cared or nobody was there for you, chances are slim you'd have the courage to fight back. Also, the majority of bullies are that way because they themselves are being bullied - likely by family members. I see fathers screaming the most awful things at their 6-9 year old children during sports events. Symptoms to look for if you suspect that your child may be a bullying victim A child who may be the victim of school bullying may be reluctant to tell his parents out of shame or fear. But many kids who suffer from school bullying may display some symptoms common to victims of bullying behavior. If you suspect that your child may be a target of school bullying, look for these signs:</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">Many children don't tell their parents, teachers, or anyone else that they are being bullied. That makes it important to look for possible warning signs that your child is being bullied. It is also important to look for signs that your child is a bully, including that he is impulsive, gets easily frustrated, lacks empathy, has trouble following rules, and/or views violence in a positive way. only 24 to 50 percent of children who are bullied talk to an adult about the bullying Children who are bullied often develop low self-esteem and can develop problems at school and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide. looking for signs of bullying, just in case your child is being bullied and hasn't told you This 214-page book is subtitled The Legend of Gretchen and uses a comic book-style story to introduce key information about bullies and bullying, including the different forms of bullying, how to avoid being bullied (or being a bully), helping friends who are being bullied, avoiding cyberbullying and talking to an adult when you are being bullied.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">My son had a teacher who started the bulling, I found this teacher addressing my son with an abusive language making fun of him in front of other kids.

"Bullying is extremely damaging to the bully and the victim. Your article indicated that bullying is often a sign of problems at home; abuse and/or poor supervision at home and lack of self esteem. Helping the bully address his or her behavior and personal or family issues and learn alternative responses will help both the bully AND the victim. Subjecting people to public humiliation rarely improves any one's self esteem. In response to the movie, she is amazed that children are permitted to behave in such a mean-spirited way at school, and has asked why are there no adults present during recess and lunch breaks to control injust behavior.

My daughter comes home crying and I talk to the principal, her teacher, and the girls' moms but they haven't been helping me with my daughter's situation.

Later learning that I was the reason she cut herself. What I had said and done had caused a poor, innocent, beautiful young lady to go to the extent of cutting herself. She told me that at times she wanted to actually kill herself. I didnt find out until later that my 12 year old daughter was getting beat up by a 15 1/2 year old boy in 7th every week.

So what as a grandmother can I do ? Just wait until she is hurt ? I'm worried about her safety I don't feel the school handled it properly. How can she be so scared and then they basically tell her you'll be fine....do they not watch tv watch the news ? After enduring 2 years of this I was probably within a week of becoming an arsonist. I ended up going to a psychiatrist to help with my depression, lack of sleep and fear of even going to school due to the attacks and found out that the in-school counselor had TOLD the very CLASSMATES I was being attacked by that I had been to a shrink!</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">I was mortified! even my so-called friends now looked at me like I had two heads! Considered suicide, considered arson, wondered how much it would cost to hire someone to attack my attackers. My 13 year old was having trouble fitting in as she put it. During that time she skipped those classes &amp; spent her time hanging out in the bathroom &amp; meeting all the wrong kids. Ofcourse i got those automated phone calls &amp; spoke to her about, she would tell she was in class &amp; they must have made a mistake (me not seeing the signs &amp; trying to recall how it truely is to a teenager) Then i get a call that she was caught under the under the influance, she admitting to smoking weed in the bathroom. I saw the quick change in her this bullying did.</paragraph><paragraph parID="43">The coming home crying in the shower so i wont notice, the not eating, the waking up in the middle of the night, the hiding behind the building waiting for the bus the not wanting to do nothing. This is not where the story ends.... She has been being bully by a group of girls (name calling, things thrown at her, lunch stolen) i ofcourse told her to ignore them at first, then i was getting calls from her teacher stating she a good student &amp; doesnt have any problems out, i decided to ! That afternoon i told my daughter that i had told her teacher &amp; she said 'mom, she knows &amp; see's these girls doing this' Yesterday, i pick up my daughter &amp; the councilor comes out &amp; tells me that she walked into the gym &amp; found her crying &amp; that my daughter told her the girls were messing with her &amp; that she would take care of it. that are being forced to endure this torture because we as parents failed to see the signs ofcourse the principle was busy giving tours of this wonderful alternative school. she for the first time reacted towards me by telling me to not get involved or it will be worst for her. they apparently told her she was not wanted in their circle not liked, she was different and weird. Although she didn't want to say anything to me the first week i noticed that something was wrong when the weekend rolled in she told me everything that had happened during the week and why this was happening, the taunts in the school bus the taunts in school grounds.</paragraph><paragraph parID="44">But she forbid me to get involved and that she didnt want me making it a big deal that would cause more drama and more teases for being a snitch that she needed to deal with it herself and! that she would not allow them to win. But her grades did drop which is something that I was not happy with. She didn't want me walking her to the school bus anymore like a little girl (her words) but would allow my mother to give her a ride and drop her off like all the others. I am keeping an eye and trying to understand after all dont you remember being a teen and wanting the world to understand you. I was bullied all 3 years in Middle School as well but unlike her i never stopped them never had the courage to say anything just endure. the story is long if you want more contact me.</paragraph><paragraph parID="45">i just hope i got to the point. Parents need to know what their kids are up to and some just ignore as long as they stay out of trouble and have decent grades. " "great stuff vry helpful" "I think that the bully should have been suspended" "As one who was majorly bullied back in 1969-1972,I still haven't forgotton the cruel raviges of one Christy H.from 8th-12th grade. "my daughter is a 10th grader this year and some ofher freinds from before are no longer her freinds and they get others not to be her freind, my daughter skipped her last period class to speak to the principal about this,never notifying me (parents) the constant talking about her continues one girl threw a tissue at her in class,principal again notified, a note got put in one of the bullies backpack, they were quick to assume it was my daughter, the principal put all these girls together in a room with no supervision verbal words were exchanged. While some bullies are insecure, the majority have high self-esteem, popularity, above average intelligence, and are verbally and socially adept.</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">Just as targets need to be taught the language to respond and given opportunities to feel good about themselves, bullies must be taught acceptable, alternative behaviors and given chances to gain positive attention. It's especially important that they're taught empathy ("How would you feel if you were in his shoes?") , see respect and conciliation modeled at home, are disciplined in a consistent manner, are taught the importance of taking responsibility for actions, and that they develop a better understanding of consequences. Plus, once they know about bullying, adults can do things to help the kid who's been bullied feel better and stronger. Any kid who gets bullied is likely to feel left out and alone. Bullying makes kids feel terrible - and not just the kid who's being bullied. Learn to recognize signs of bullying, review bullying statistics, and learn ways of dealing with a bully.</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">Friendship also helps prevent bullying because bullies are less likely to pick on kids when they are with friends. It diminishes self-esteem, leaves kids feeling depressed and anxious, and can have long-lasting effects. The question is how much they have, what they do with it, what parents are teaching them at home about it, and what's being modeled for that child in terms of managing aggression. Kids who are bullied at home are far more likely to go out and bully other kids. But the number of kids who bully others because they truly have sociopathy brewing, or are oppositional defiant kids, who may in fact derive gratification from the pain of others, is a relatively small number compared to the amount of bullying that goes on. Others, and this is particularly true for girls, who may actually have a high social IQ and know how to work a system, will use bullying for power, to fortify their position. Is the parent expecting this child to be the powerful one?</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">Are they sending either overt or covert messages that they want their child to be important, to be popular, to be feared? Insecurity can also drive bullying-the feeling that unless you bully you will be the powerless one. A child who's being bullied at school at least comes home at some point and is safe with her family. With the computer that potentially never goes away: at any time you could turn it on and find that someone has written something to shame and humiliate you, and you might not even know who is doing that to you. You see, I always loved school, but these two relentless girls introduced anxiety, stress, and nausea into an equation that had formerly consisted of learning, eagerness, and excitement about going to school. After all, it's easier to bully somebody than to work things out, manage your emotions, and learn to solve problems. The public perception of bullying is that bullies are acting out to cover their own fears.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">Ask any child of any age where they are most likely to get bullied and the answer is almost always the school bus. Kids of varying ages are virtually unsupervised except for a bus driver who is trying to focus on driving the kids home safely. I've worked with hundreds of adolescents and they list the following as the most likely places where bullying occurs: 1. I must admit that I also looked up a high school bully . These were two girls who had literally made me sick. Sadly, we start noticing bullying in our schools on the first day of kindergarten. Bullying is happening in all areas of our society as people jockey for their rung on the ladder of status.</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">Individuals, cultures, and societies exhibit varying degrees of bullying behavior. Understanding Bullying Behavior Kids bully for many reasons. Some bully because they feel insecure. In other cases,kids bully because they simply don't know that it's unacceptable to pick on kids who are different because of size, looks, race, or religion. In some cases bullying is a part of an ongoing pattern of defiant or aggressive behavior. These kids are likely to need help learning to manage anger and hurt, frustration, or other strong emotions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">They may not have the skills they need to cooperate with others. Professional counseling can often help them learn to deal with their feelings, curb their bullying, and improve their social skills. Some kids who bully at school and in settings with their peers are copying behavior that they see at home. Kids who are exposed to aggressive and unkind interactions in the family often learn to treat others the same way. And kids who are on the receiving end of taunting learn that bullying can translate into control over children they perceive as weak. Helping Kids Stop Bullying Let your child know that bullying is unacceptable and that there will be serious consequences at home, school, and in the community if it continues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">Tactics to Try For example, if your child bullies other kids via email, text messages, or a social networking site, dock phone or computer privileges for a period of time. If your child acts aggressively at home, with siblings or others, put a stop to it. Teach more appropriate (and nonviolent) ways to react, like walking away. Teach kids to treat others with respect and kindness. Teach your child that it is wrong to ridicule differences (i.e., race, religion, appearance, special needs, gender, economic status) and try to instill a sense of empathy for those who are different. Consider getting involved together in a community group where your child can interact with kids who are different.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">Learn about your child's social life. Look for insight into the factors that may be influencing your child's behavior in the school environment (or wherever the bullying is occurring). Talk with parents of your child's friends and peers, teachers, guidance counselors, and the school principal. Do other kids bully? What about your child's friends? What kinds of pressures do the kids face at school? Talk to your kids about those relationships and about the pressures to fit in.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">Get them involved in activities outside of school so that they meet and develop friendships with other kids. Think carefully about how you talk around your kids and how you handle conflict and problems. If you behave aggressively - toward or in front of your kids - chances are they'll follow your example. Instead, point out positives in others, rather than negatives. And when conflicts arise in your own life, be open about the frustrations you have and how you cope with your feelings. Starting at Home When looking for the influences on your child's behavior, look first at what's happening at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">Kids who live with yelling, name-calling, putdowns, harsh criticism, or physical anger from a sibling or parent/caregiver may act that out in other settings. It's natural - and common - for kids to fight with their siblings at home. And unless there's a risk of physical violence it's wise not to get involved. But monitor the name-calling and any physical altercations and be sure to talk to each child regularly about what's acceptable and what's not. It's important to keep your own behavior in check too. Watch how you talk to your kids, and how you react to your own strong emotions when they're around. There will be situations that warrant discipline and constructive criticism.</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">If you're not pleased with your child's behavior, stress that it's the behavior that you'd like your child to change, and you have confidence that he or she can do it. Guidance counselors, pastors, therapists, and your doctor can help. Getting Help To help a child stop bullying, talk with teachers, guidance counselors, and other school officials who can help you identify situations that lead to bullying and provide assistance. Your doctor also might be able to help. If your child has a history of arguing, defiance, and trouble controlling anger, consider an evaluation with a therapist or behavioral health professional. As difficult and frustrating as it can be to help kids stop bullying, remember that bad behavior won't just stop on its own.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">Whether the bullying is physical or verbal, if it's not stopped it can lead to more aggressive antisocial behavior and interfere with your child's success in school and ability to form and sustain friendships. You can also find dozens of research-based and practical tips about bullying (as well as 100 other topics) in my latest book, The Big Book of Parenting Solutions. Know Bullying Signs Most every child will have an "off-day." Most kids may even occasionally pinch, hit, or send a verbal barb to another child. Look for repeated and intentional patterns of aggression. Bullying can be physical, verbal, emotional (or relational), sexual in nature or electronic (via text, email, IM etc).</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">You may not spot these when your child is with you, so: Don't do this alone. Ask other caregivers (teachers, coaches, babysitters, relatives) for their perspective. Get on board with others. Don't base your verdict on one social setting. Try to observe your child is different settings. Kids act differently when we're not around.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">Bullying also does not always happen in the same situation. Don't be so quick to dismiss an unfavorable complaint about your child. Dig a little more. Get the facts. Could the complaint be legitimate? I know it's tough to admit your child may be bullying, but the sooner you stop this behavior the better for your child. Don't assume because your child is popular that bullying isn't happening.</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">One study found that some of the most popular kids in schools (particularly those in the "second tier" of popularity) and even those in leadership roles display aggressive behaviors. Damages another child's property or clothing Quick-tempered, impulsive, easily frustrated, flares off the top Takes pleasure in seeing a child (or animal) in distress, unconcerned if someone is upset Finds it difficult to see a situation from the other person's point of view Refuses to accept responsibility or denies wrong doing when evidence shows guilt Blames the victim or says the child "deserved what he got"; good at talking way out of situations</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">Shows little sympathy or concern for the victim or a child who was hurt Targets those who are weaker or younger or animals Signs to watch for and what to do if you suspect a child is bullying others "My son's teacher says he bullies a classmate by saying cruel things, deliberately slamming or tripping him. My advice: believe the teacher! The good news is because bullying is a learned behavior it can also be unlearned. So don't be too quick to say: "Not my kid!"</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">There is no one profile to a bully so here are a few typical behaviors of bullying to watch for. Signs of Possible Bullying (Look for a repeated pattern) Excludes or shuns another child Is insensitive to the feelings or needs or others; lacks empathy Taunts, intimidates or harasses Spreads vicious rumors verbally and or electronically that hurt or ruin another's reputation Physically aggressive (hits, punches, kicks, slams, chokes)</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">Positive views of violence Threatens with force or fear; extortion Marked need to control and dominate others Intolerant of "differences" whether it be sexual orientations, cultures, religious beliefs, appearances, age, gender, or abilities and often slams those differences Keep a record of your child's behaviors. Note the date and time, where the incident took place and who was involved. You may begin to see a pattern emerge as to "Why your child is using aggression to meet his needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">It's not easy to hear negative things about your child, but don't dismiss or excuse any report that your child is bullying: "He has friends." "She's a model student." Catching an aggressive behavior early is the best way to stop it from becoming a habit. Here are ways to dig a little deeper and find out what's really happening (and it may take a bit of detective work). Ask the source for further details. If someone tells you your child is a bully or using aggressive behaviors, ask them to describe "What that behavior looked like." You need specific details so you will know the type of behavior (such as fighting, put downs, excluding, threatening, giving racial slurs) you're dealing with.</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">Make sure the behavior is bullying not teasing. Bullying can be misconstrued with teasing (and all kids tease!) A bullied child never considers the bully to be a friend and the bullied child can never hold his or her own. The dynamics (who is in the group, who is leading the group, what the makeup and concept of the group are) all can be clues as to why your child may be bullying. The bullying behavior may not happen when you're around so enlist the perspective of other caring and trustworthy adults who know your child. Set up a conference with the teacher. Go and talk privately with the coach or scout leader.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">Ask the day care worker or babysitter for her opinion. Talk to those whose opinion you trust and see your child in different social settings. Are they seeing those same bullying behaviors? Don't ask "Why" are you doing this? Kids usually don't respond well to "why questions" and may not know the reason. Ask instead "What" queries: "What did you want to happen?" "What did the child do to you?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">"What happened right before?" Your child may be the "lead" bully who is initiating the aggressive behavior. But we are seeing a pattern that children who are repeatedly bullied may resort to bullying themselves. No one is defending them and they have no recourse and so they bully. Also, the child may also be not the "lead" bully but the "henchman": this child resorts to bullying to protect himself because the bully has a power hold on him or wants protection. Identify exact location and time. Bullying is a repeated behavior that usually happens in the same places (called "hot spots").</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">Those places typically are not adult supervised (such as the back of the school bus, the fringes of a playground, bathrooms, under stairwells, in locker rooms). If possible find out where the bullying is happening. Your first line of duty: tell your kid those spots are off-limits. And when you see the bully acting mean, you can say, "Hey, knock it off, that's not cool," and invite the kid who's being picked on to walk away with you. You can just say, "C'mon, let's go." This can work even better if you get a couple of your friends to join you in standing up for the kid. Tell your friends ahead of time: "I'm going to stick up for that kid.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">Be sure to update the adult about what's going on until the problem is solved. This is also a very good thing to talk to parents about. Your parent will want to know about all this and can give you more advice and support. Just seeing someone else be bullied makes others feel bad. Unfortunately, it is sometimes hard to tell if your child is being bullied, since kids often aren't quick to tell anyone.

The school board took great measures to write the school rules, if you break them so forth. It amazes me that in the booklet it does not state if a child is being bullied by a teacher, what steps do the student or the parent take. I'm fortunate to know the steps, and I know what steps to take for my daughter who was bullied. I'm in the process, this is for all the students in our school who are being bullied.</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">[Parent] "I believe this program looks so good for children to feel anonymous and "safe" in reporting bullying behaviour without having to identify themselves. When my son was in grade 2, he was a victim and was bullied by a grade 7 boy. Children should not be afraid of going to school. Such a statement is naive and similar to saying that all children learn in the same manner. It is very hurtful, not all bullying is resulted in physical harm, emotional harm is very scaring. It hurts to feel that no one likes you, nothing you do is right, everyday there will be something, to question yourself - Am I special?

I have implemented my own family plan consisting of siblings helping siblings remove themselves from the situation, and not giving the bullies the satisfaction of getting the best of their victims through their reactions, as well as forming their own groups of friends that don't participate in these acts, whereby this would teach these bullying offenders that they will lose friends once they all ignore their taunts, find more healthy friendships, and stop giving them the satisfaction of feeling superior by having "cronies" that just join along in their poor behaviour to be a part of the "cool kids". A simple slap on the wrist does not suffice.

If you or someone you know is bothered by a bully, talk to someone you trust. Tell someone about it and keep telling until something is done.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">It can make kids feel hurt, scared, sick, lonely, embarrassed and sad . A bully might say mean things about someone, grab a kid's stuff, make fun of someone, or leave a kid out of the group on purpose. Some bullies threaten people or try to make them do things they don't want to do. Bullying is a big problem that affects lots of kids. Three-quarters of all kids say they have been bullied or teased. Being bullied can make kids feel really bad. The stress of dealing with bullies can make kids feel sick.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">Bullying can make kids not want to play outside or go to school. It's hard to keep your mind on schoolwork when you're worried about how you're going to deal with the bully near your locker. Bullying can make school a place of fear and can lead to more violence and more stress for everyone. They might pick on kids who get upset easily or who have trouble sticking up for themselves. Sometimes bullies pick on someone who is smarter than they are or different from them in some way. Gemma told her mom that this one kid was picking on her for having red hair and freckles. She wanted to be like the other kids but she couldn't change those things about herself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">Luis lived in fear of Brian - every day he would give his lunch money to Brian but he still beat him up. Luis even cried one day and another girl told everyone that he was a baby and had been crying. Luis was embarrassed and felt so bad about himself and about school. When your preschooler says, "Kids are mean to me" or "I hate so-and-so, and I don't want to play with him anymore," it's your first clue that something's up. In my case, the eye-opener was when my son, Kevin, brought home his preschool class picture. As he pointed from one smiling child to the next, he told me, "That's Thomas, that's Riley, that's Jenny, that's ..." (ominous drum roll, please) "my bully, that's ..." Whoa there, little fella, back up.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">In a preschool class of 3- and 4-year-olds? Don't bullies have to be older - or at least capable of opening their own milk at snack time? I scrutinized the image of the brown-haired, blue-eyed boy standing in the back row in the photograph. He wasn't scowling, and he didn't have Bluto-like muscles bulging underneath his ordinary little T-shirt. But my protective impulse was fueled by Kevin's stories of being banned from the playground pirate fort and pinched during circle time. Maybe not life-threatening things, but definitely not nice either. With school bullying consistently in the media spotlight, most parents are aware that it's a serious problem.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">That's encouraging - but we're forgetting about our youngest and most vulnerable age group, the toddler and preschool crowd. We once thought these kids were too young for the kind of tormenting we associate with bullying. But sadly, that's just not true - and because little-kid bullying is so surprising to many parents, it's not noticed as readily as in older kids, says Henry D. Schlinger, Ph.D., director of the applied behavior analysis program at California State University at Los Angeles. Adults dismiss it as "kids being kids." It doesn't have to be that way, and that kind of attitude ignores the very real developmental leaps kids make in late toddlerhood. After 3, that changes: "The brain has the ability to understand another point of view, so that's the age that premeditated and purposeful aggression could begin," says Nixon. In other words, these little troublemakers should know better.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">The reasons kids bully vary, says Schlinger. "Often, kids this age are imitating behavior they've seen before from a parent, sibling or friend," he says. Other kids turn to bullying to get attention, either from adults or peers. Still others bully for more complex reasons. "It's much more concerning when a child bullies because it makes him feel good to see signs of injury, fear or misery in his victim," says Schlinger. "That type of bully can be hard to stop." Too often, parents and teachers take a wait-and-see approach with preschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">That's not helping anyone - the victim or the bully. "The problem with ignoring smaller incidents is that intervention doesn't happen until it reaches a crisis point or someone gets hurt," says Schlinger. Before showing me his school picture, my son had told me time and time again that a boy was "bothering" him, and I'd dismissed it. But When is it Just a Fight? Experts define bullying as intentionally aggressive behavior, usually involving an imbalance of power and repeated over time. It can be verbal (put-downs, taunts, name calling), physical (pushing, kicking, punching) or relational (rumors, social rejection, exclusion). Not all confrontational behavior can or should be defined as bullying, though.</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Kids are active and impulsive, and they're going to have spur-of-the-moment scuffles, friendship spats and wrestling matches that occasionally get out of hand. Everyday play-related conflict can make kids stronger because they learn through experience how to compromise, negotiate and forgive. Bullying, on the other hand, does the exact opposite. It systematically undermines kids' self-esteem; whether it's physical or emotional, it can cause hurt feelings, fear and anxiety - even beginner bullying between little kids. Being picked on, pushed around and shunned is not acceptable at any age. I saw it first!" tug-of-war over a shovel in the sandbox.</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">A bully, on the other hand, might snatch the shovel away and tell the other child that he'll throw sand in his face if he tries to get the shovel back. One possible sign of a bully? He's smiling during a dispute, says Barbara Coloroso, author of The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander: From Preschool to High School - How Parents and Teachers Can Help Break the Cycle of Violence (Harper Paperbacks; $14.99). If two boys are fighting over a book and both boys are upset, that's conflict. If a child bashes your son over the head with a book and grins as your son cries, that's bullying, explains Coloroso. Not all bullies act this way, but most kids who do are bullies. Another sign to watch for is sneakiness or secretive behavior: A bully doesn't want grown-ups to catch him in the act, so he'll carry out his bullying covertly; he knows what he's doing isn't right.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">Also, a bully will act as a ringleader and recruit others to join him, not just at school but at playdates or on the playground, too. When 3-year-old Dayna Donovan tried to join another group of girls running around the playground equipment, they deliberately ran away from her, says her mom, Suzanne. To Suzanne's dismay, Dayna kept running after the girls. They taunted Dayna and told her she wasn't allowed to go down the slide and threw wood chips on it when she attempted to slide down. "My heart broke when I could see from the look on her face that she understood what was going on," says Donovan. "Those little girls were being downright mean." Bullying can be hard to identify because it can spark bad behavior from the "good" kid, too.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">Brisja Riggins's 3-year-old son, Brown, was taunted mercilessly by a boy in his nursery-school class. The boy would chant, "Browny towny, Browny towny, Browny towny" over and over until, finally, Brown got so angry and frustrated that he struck back and got in trouble. "There's only so much taunting a little boy can take before he's pressed beyond his ability to behave," says Riggins. Still, the mama bear in me wanted to march right over to the school, grab that pup by the scruff of his neck and tell him that if he kept harassing my kid, he wouldn't live to see his fifth birthday. One way to tell the difference between conflict and bullying is to look at intent. Whatever form bullying takes, it can have serious psychological and mental repercussions on both the victim and the perpetrator. And the one being victimized by bullies may suffer from fear, anger and insecurities his entire life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">No matter which way you look at it, bullying in school or in the workplace is harmful to everyone and measures must be taken to stop it.

Cyber-bullying now means that kids can't escape the bully like they once could. Bullying should not be confused with teasing, rejection, random acts of violence or physicality and conflict.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">While children will often tease or fight, this bickering should not be confused with bullying. Bullying is about lack of power as one person is powerless to stop the teasing or physical abuse. Bullying is the selective, uninvited, repetitive oppression of one person by another person or group. It's been estimated that around 40% of people has experienced some type of bullying in the past. The ghosts from the past are never far away for parents and can sometimes influence the way we react to current circumstances, including when our own children experience difficulties in their relationships inside or outside school. Bullying is an insidious behaviour that transgresses children's natural right to feel safe and secure. It can adversely affect their learning, emotional well-being, further peer relations and their sense of self.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">Types of Bullying Bullying takes many forms and guises including physical and emotional abuse, intimidation, harassment and exclusion. It now has a well-publicised cyber-dimension which has moved the goalposts for many kids. In the past children could escape bullying behaviours they may have experienced by being at home. Girls bully just as much as boys but they do it in less physical ways. While boys use physical intimidation or verbal abuse to wield power, girls are more likely to use exclusion or verbal sarcasm to assert themselves. Is your child being bullied?</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">If you think your child is being bullied then handle with care as children often don't want to admit that they are on the receiving end of bullying. Some kids keep it to their chest so it helps to be on lookout for warning signs such as: items being stolen, changing the route to school and withdrawal from usual activities. 30 March 2012 Describing what you see and how you think or feel, without judgement or comparison when kids behave favourably or unfavourably reduces sibling resentment, and enables you to respond to various situations as they arise. I went through a lot of shunning and name calling in eighth grade and I used to spend our lunch and break times in the bathroom, many times crying. I remember some of my best friends turned against me and I just felt completely worthless. I convinced myself there was something about me that made all of these people turn against me and ostracize me! Verbal bullying (like using words such as "gay" as insults or speaking badly about another) or nonverbal bullying (such as ignoring another person) can have long-lasting effects.</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">I saw a lot of gossiping and social exclusion among girls, many times much physical bullying among boys and also verbal and cyberbullying among both boys and girls. We all reach a point when we say, "Enough is enough! I can't take this anymore!" Perhaps somebody said something mean to you or gossiped about you. Somebody may have punched or kicked you; the point being, an individual or a group of people did something to you that made you feel bad about yourself. If you see bullying happen, then, as I explain in my book, you are a not-so-innocent bystander. Bystanders are so important and they have potential to make such a big difference!</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">Bullies like feeling popular and that they have the support of their friends and classmates in general. If you see someone bullied, you can help take that feeling of power away from the bully. It's a great thing to do, but here are some alternatives that also can be very helpful: Talk to the victim afterward. Ask if the person is OK, tell them you think what happened was wrong, and offer to help them contact a grownup. Use "group correction." This is when a bunch of people agree that they're going to stand up to a bully.</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">You can just calmly tell the bully to stop and leave the person alone. This works best when students have been trained in how it works, which is why schools need to educate kids about this. If you can't do 1 or 2, at least tell a grownup (teacher, coach, parent) about what you saw. Adults really can actually help, even though I get it, we don't always want to admit this can be the case. But sometimes problems are way out of our hands and we need to get somebody else involved who can make the situation better. (p.s.

This can invite more abuse.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">- Information about bullying and strategies to make it stop. Tip #2: Spot the warning signs that a child or teen is being bullied If a child is being bullied it may not be obvious to a parent or teacher. Most bullying occurs away from adults, when kids are alone in hallways or on the way home from school, for example. Bullies tend to be adept at hiding their behavior from adults and bullying victims will often cover up evidence because of a sense of shame at being victimized. Kids are also reluctant to tell their parents about being cyberbullied out of fear they'll lose their computer or cell phone privileges. Warning signs your child may be a bully</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">Your child: Frequently becomes violent with others Gets into physical or verbal fights with others Gets sent to the principal's office or detention a lot Has extra money or new belongings that cannot be explained Is quick to blame others Will not accept responsibility for his or her actions</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">Has friends who bully others Needs to win or be best at everything Monitor technology use in younger children. Set up filters on your child's computer and keep it in a busy area of your house so you can easily monitor its use. Learn the common acronyms kids use online and in text messages. Bullying affects many of us, kids and adults alike, and can leave anyone feeling hurt, angry, frightened, and even depressed or overwhelmed. Because bullying is so common, many people think it's normal and should be tolerated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">By learning about why some kids bully and why others are bullied, you can help yourself or a loved one deal with bullying, and develop the resilience and self-confidence to succeed in life. Bullying is repeated aggressive behavior that can be physical, verbal, or relational. Boys frequently bully using physical threats and actions, while girls are more likely to engage in verbal or relationship bullying. The results are similar: You are made to feel hurt, angry, afraid, helpless, hopeless, isolated, ashamed, and even guilty that the bullying is somehow your fault. You may even feel suicidal. Your physical health is likely to suffer, and you are at a greater risk of developing mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, or adult onset PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">You're more likely to miss, skip, or drop out of school to avoid being bullied. The most damaging aspect of bullying is its repetition. Bullies are often relentless, bullying over and over again for long periods of time.

Post photos and other personal information online without your consent. Pretend to be someone else to trick or humiliate you. Spread lies and rumors about you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">Create a group or social networking page to target or exclude you. Dupe you into revealing personal information that can then be used to hurt you. In many cases, cyber-bullying can be even more painful than face-to-face bullying. A lot of cyber-bullying can be done anonymously, so you may not be sure who is targeting you. This can make you feel even more threatened and can embolden bullies, as they believe online anonymity means they're less likely to get caught. Since cyberbullies can't see your reaction, they will often go much further in their harassment or ridicule than they would do face-to-face with you. Why you're being bullied or cyber-bullied</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">Research shows that about 25 percent of kids experience bullying and even more of us are impacted by cyber-bullying, so you're not alone. While there are many reasons why bullies may be targeting you, the main reasons are usually your physical appearance or social standing within your peer group. Bullies tend to pick on people who are "different" or don't fit in with the mainstream. It may be because of how you dress, act, or because of your race, religion, or sexual orientation. It may simply be that you're new to the school or neighborhood and haven't made friends yet. Gay and lesbian youths are particularly at risk of bullying. Talk to a parent, teacher, counselor, or other trusted adult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">Seeing a counselor does not mean there is something wrong with you. Learn to deal with stress. Finding ways to relieve stress can make you more resilient so you won't feel overwhelmed by bullying. Exercise, meditation, positive self-talk, muscle relaxation and breathing exercises are all good ways to manage the stress from bullying. Tips for dealing with bullying and cyber-bullying There is no single solution to bullying and cyber-bullying. It may take some experimenting with a variety of different responses to find the strategy that works best for your situation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">To defeat a bully, you need to retain your self-control and preserve your sense of self. Tip #1: Respond as bullying is happening Walk away. Bullies want to know they have control over your emotions so don't react with anger or retaliate with physical force. If you walk away, ignore them, or calmly and assertively tell them you're not interested in what they have to say, you're demonstrating that they don't have control over you. Protect yourself. If you can't walk away and are being physically hurt, protect yourself so you can get away.</paragraph><paragraph parID="115">Your safety is the first priority. Report the bullying to a trusted adult . If you don't report threats and assaults, a bully will often become more and more aggressive. In many cases adults can find ways to help with the problem without letting the bully know it was you who reported them. Repeat as necessary . Like the bully, you may have to be relentless. Report each and every bullying incident until it stops.</paragraph><paragraph parID="116">There is no reason for you to ever put up with bullying. Tip #2: Handle a cyber-bully Do not respond to cyber-bullying messages . The bully wants to feel in control of your emotions, so the best response is no response. Document cyber-bullying . Save and print out emails, text messages, or screenshots. Block the cyber-bully on your phone, IM list, websites, or social media pages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">Report inappropriate messages to an Internet service provider or website moderator; report threats to the police. Tip #3: Reframe the problem of bullying or cyber-bullying By changing your attitude towards bullying you can help regain a sense of control. Try to view bullying from a different perspective . The bully is an unhappy, frustrated person who wants to have control over your feelings so that you feel as badly as they do. Don't give them the satisfaction. Look at the big picture.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">Bullying can be extremely painful, but try asking yourself how important it will seem to you in the long run. Will it matter in a year? Is it worth getting so upset over? If the answer is no, focus your time and energy elsewhere. Focus on the positive. Reflect on all the things you appreciate in your life, including your own positive qualities and gifts. Make a list and refer to it whenever you feel down.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">Find the humor. If you're relaxed enough to recognize the absurdity of a bullying situation, and to comment on it with humor, you'll likely no longer be an interesting target for a bully. Don't try to control the uncontrollable. Many things in life are beyond our control-including the behavior of other people. Rather than stressing, focus on the things you can control such as the way you choose to react to bullies. Tip #4: Avoid isolation But no one needs to put up with a bully's behavior.</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">Everyone has the right to feel safe, and being bullied makes people feel unsafe. Some have been bullied themselves. How can you stop yourself from getting angry or showing you're upset? Being a victim can cause a kid to shut down completely and be unwilling to talk to their parents. According to Dr. Haber, kids give signs and parents need to be able to read those signs and act immediately. "A lot of signs of bullying look like any other things," Dr. Haber says. "If a kid doesn't want to go to school ...or wants to avoid social situations they were in before, or really likes playing a sport and then doesn't want to play that sports anymore...it's kind of like a clue that something is not going right."</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">A kid doesn't have to make a drastic change to show he is being bullied. As soon as a kid starts to slowly change their daily routine, it's time to start questioning what triggered the change. Dr. Haber emphasizes talking to your child consistently and making sure your child understands that he or she can come to you for anything. The topic of bullying has made national and local headlines as several high-profile events have brought this issue into the spotlight. Bullying is a problem that affects millions of students every day. Bullying is intentional tormenting in physical, verbal or psychological ways. Often people dismiss bullying among kids as a normal part of growing up.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">Bullying is harmful and can lead children and teenagers to feel tense and afraid. Children and adolescents who bully thrive on controlling or dominating others and have often been the victims of physical abuse or bullying themselves. Bullying is a growing issue across the nation and Katy ISD is not immune to this problem. Both campus and district administrators are working together to provide a safe and orderly learning environment that encourages community involvement and engagement. At the district level, we have implemented several initiatives: The Department of Campus Administrative Support, through each campus' Safe and Drug Free Coordinator, is providing a series of DVD's and literature specifically addressing bullying. The Department of Campus Administrative Support also has a video library from which campuses may select resource materials on various topics which include bullying, drugs and school safety.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">Parents are asked to talk to their children on a consistent basis to gauge their emotional and physical well-being and possible response to bullying situations. Did you know that 25% of public schools report that bullying among kids occurs on a daily or weekly basis? And that 1 in 5 high school students report being bullied in the past year? If one of your kids opens up about being bullied, praise him or her for being brave enough to discuss it and offer unconditional support. A child who isn't easily ruffled has a better chance of staying off a bully's radar.

Kids who experience severe or long-term bullying may develop ongoing self-esteem and confidence issues, and may have a hard time making or keeping friends. The psychological effects of bullying can be detrimental to quality of life both during childhood and into adulthood, and some children may experience physical abuse and theft or destruction or property, as well. In order for adults to effectively step in and help kids overcome serious instances of bullying, it's important that they be able to recognize the signs of such a problem in a victim. Sometimes, parents may suspect that children are being bullied when some other issue is actually at hand, or parents may ignore the common signs of bullying and fail to be of any help to their child. Through taking a look at some of the most prominent indications that a child is being bullied, parents can become better equipped to come to their children's aid when needed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="125">When chronic bullying occurs, it may not be limited to one area, but there are often specific venues in which a child experiences the bullying behavior. For instance, a child may be bullied in gym class and between class periods, but will tend to experience the episodes at school alone. This can sometimes create a strong desire to avoid certain places, whether it's school -which is an especially common venue for bullying-, an after-class club, a sports group, or other venues a child frequently visits. If a child seems to suddenly develop a disliking of certain places and asks not to go or appears to feign sickness in order to avoid these areas, parents may wish to investigate further to assess whether bullying is a likely cause of the new, avoidant behavior. It's important to keep in mind that other issues may be to blame for a growing dislike of certain venues and activities, so talking with a child to get an understanding of the reasons behind the behavior is essential. Though children may not experience episodes of bullying at school or may not show a significant fear of going to classes, many who are bullied will begin to lose interest in their studies and are likely to start bringing home poorer report cards than parents expect. Of course, a variety of factors may be involved in the lowering of grades over time, but when parents notice a sharp drop-off in a child's performance, thinking about the possibility of bullying is a prudent idea.</paragraph><paragraph parID="126">Parents may wish to speak with teachers to get a feel for the source of the falling grades; children who are bullied typically stop handing in assignments, fail to participate in group activities, and otherwise withdraw from their studies, all of which are behaviors that a teacher should be able to identify as distinct from a lack of ability. Insisting that children improve their grades without addressing the possibility of bullying can have disappointing consequences, as children may respond to parents' reactions by further declining in their academic involvement. Most kids have a set of favorite activities that are either practiced at home and among friends or are carried over from activity groups at school or in special clubs. Though a child's favored activities are bound to change from time to time, a sudden lack of interest in any such activities can be indicative of a bullying problem. Kids who seem to not want to go out to play or who are not observed interacting with their toys or participating in favorite crafts may be suffering from any number of emotional issues, and parents can usually be most helpful by offering their ability to listen and provide support. While not every case of waning interest in activities is necessarily linked to bullying, this type of behavior is usually a strong signal that something in the child's social or intrapersonal life is amiss. Kids who are being bullied on a regular basis are also more likely to exhibit behaviors that suggest depression and general malaise; from lowered physical activity to longer times spent sleeping and beyond, these symptoms should be watched carefully by concerned parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="127">When a child is suspected of being a victim of bullying, parents can feel understandably alarmed. Though it may be possible for parents and other adults to effectively involve themselves in the problem and help children overcome the issue, being able to accurately identify symptoms of bullying is important. When adults stay observant of children's behavior and invite open discussions about the possibility of bullying, they can more easily be of assistance to kids. What about if your child is on the receiving end of a bully? It is effecting school work, relationship with classmates (because not sure who they can trust). This effects my child to point of physical illness. My child us currently seeing a psychologist regarding this, however, with no action from the school - there are no results.</paragraph><paragraph parID="128">Listen to what your child is telling you and try to hear who is involved and how and where each incident takes place.

My 11 year old son has a long-time friend who's now taken to belittling him and others verbally,taking food and his school supplies when he feels like it and offering little in the way of reciprocity. If a teen or pre-teen doesn't want to be a victim, they have to join a group. The kids who don't socialize very well-the shy or passive types-often become the targets. And the threat of violence is always behind it. If this is not taught, kids who are targets will think there's something wrong with them, and this vicious cycle-because that is truly what this is-perpetuates itself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="129">If you have been a victim of bullying, you probably understand how lonely it feels. What Counts as Bullying? When you think of bullying, you have to consider all four types: physical, verbal, nonverbal, and cyberbullying (using computer or cell phone). I think a common misconception we have is that physical bullying is the worst, when really all four types of bullying can be equally painful. As you get older, it's also good to know that bullying can be different as you go from elementary school to middle school and from middle school to high school. From my experience, in elementary school, much of the bullying happens on the playground and involves physical bullying and friendship troubles. You do, of course, find a lot of verbal bullying too.</paragraph><paragraph parID="130">In middle school, bullying gets amped up. By high school, the problem of bullying gets a little better because we've matured, but it doesn't just go away. From what I've seen, bullying in high school can be more aggressive. The word choices may change (harsher words and curse words). Also, teens are more free to communicate by text or online. Because some kids are just physically big, that can make a bully scarier. In addition, many high schools are quite large and it can be difficult for teachers to be everywhere to stop the bullying if they see it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="131">What YOU Can Do The hardest thing to do is step in on the victim's behalf, especially when you are the only one standing up. The bully never has to know you were the one who got an adult involved and so you don't have to worry about being targeted next.) I understand it is very daunting to stand beside the victim instead of behind the bully. But think about it: Wouldn't you want somebody to do the same for you? It is important that adults help us with stopping bullying, but we also need to take some responsibility ourselves! It doesn't even matter if the victim isn't your best friend in the world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="132">As I say in every single school I speak in, "You don't have to like every single person, but you do need to respect them." To share that hope, I often visit elementary, middle, and high schools. If I came to your school, here's what I'd do in the all-school assembly: I'd ask everybody to close their eyes for a minute. Then I'd ask you to think of a time when you may have been bullied. With everyone's eyes closed, how many hands do you think would reach into the air? Bullying is a big problem. Bullying Is a Big Deal</paragraph><paragraph parID="133">Bullies often pick on someone they think they can have power over. Getting a big reaction out of someone can make bullies feel like they have the power they want. Finally Gemma made friends at her local swimming pool with a girl who wished she had red hair like Gemma's. The two girls became great friends and she learned to ignore the mean girl's taunts at school. Bullies tend to bully kids who don't stick up for themselves. He said that if Luis ever told anyone he would beat him up in front of all the other kids in his class. Finally, Brian got caught threatening Luis and they were both sent to the school counselor.</paragraph><paragraph parID="134">Brian got in a lot of trouble at home. Over time, Brian learned how to make friends and ask his parents for lunch money. Luis never wanted to be friends with Brian but he did learn to act strong and more confident around him. Books on Bullying Children who become repeated victims of bullying tend to be quiet and shy in temperament. They are less inclined to fight back or make any assertive responses to the initial aggression, which is then repeated by the bully. Children who become victims typically lack friends and social support at school, and they are often not confident in their physical abilities and strengths.</paragraph><paragraph parID="135">Being targeted lowers the self-esteem of victims and can cause physical illness, depression, lower academic achievement, and can leave lifelong scars. Girl victims tend to experience more emotional distress than boy victims. Watch for signs that your child may be a victim, such as avoiding going to school, lack of friends, suddenly "lost" belongings, torn clothing, unexplained cuts or bruises, and increased anxiety about school and/or school activities. Teasing may be an unavoidable fact of life, but once teasing turns to taunting and a child is afraid that the aggressor will cause harm, the situation is more serious and crosses the line into bullying. Also, as adults, they have a higher chance of having a criminal record and substance abuse problems. What does a victim look like? What can I do as a parent?</paragraph><paragraph parID="136">Such programs teach children how to differentiate between tattling and speaking up and reward children when telling an adult about a bullying situation. Ask your child directly and take complaints of bullying seriously. Children are often ashamed or afraid to report that they have been bullied, so further inquiry into a seemingly minor complaint may uncover more serious maltreatment. Work with the school immediately to make sure your child is safe, that the bully is reprimanded in an appropriate way, that monitoring at school is adequate, and steps are taken to spread anti-bullying messages. Tell your child that being bullied is not his or her fault and you are on his or her side. Aggressors are usually known to their victims, but unable to be 'caught' -especially since there are rarely rules against the type of behavior they engage in. Girls, who are sanctioned to be 'nice' have traditionally resorted to this type of behavior, but Columbine put relational aggression on the cultural radar for both sexes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="137">During adolescence, young adults are involved in developmental tasks which include: 1) the development of an identity; 2) separation and independence from family; and 3) fitting into a peer group. When these tasks are 'perverted' by the punishing aggressions of peers, long-term affects may result. Mirroring is crucial to identity formation, and with Relational Aggression, the foundation of an adolescents sense of self may be 'loser', 'reject', 'not good enough' -not loveable-- a waste of space. Self-esteem is low, and feelings of insecurity may persist throughout life. Furthermore, trust in the external world, and in the nurturance and support of relationships in that world, is thwarted -if not destroyed. The ability to trust as an adult -and to open oneself up to close relationships -is affected. Finally, this type of behavior reinforces unproductive patterns for handling hostile emotions -on the part of victims, kids in the middle, and bullies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="138">Furthermore, by expanding and enriching your child's horizons, s/he may stumble upon a passion, which will engross her/him and help shore up a sense of identity. I hate cyberbullies, neighborhood bullies, corporate email bullies (that's when kids who were bullied abuse their power in the workplace). It turns out kids with severe food allergies are targets of bullying because of the food they can and can't eat. Learn about the warning signs of bullying and be ready to spot it and intervene early when necessary. An overwhelming majority of bullying incidents happen in front of peer bystanders - but no adults. Research shows clearly that when bystanders speak out against the bullying the bullying usually stops within seconds, but in an overwhelming majority of incidences, and for a number of reasons, bystanders do nothing to help. Learn more about the role bystanders play in the perpetuation of bullying and learn how you can teach your child to put a stop to any bullying she sees, while making sure she stays safe.</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">Being a bully victim can lead to feelings of hopelessness and even to serious depression, and research shows that people who get bullied are at an increased risk to also have suicidal thoughts and to engage in self harm. Make sure you know the warning signs of suicide and be ready to intervene if necessary, to stop what is usually a very preventable tragedy. The victims of relational bullies may never come home battered and bruised, but the pain of being the victim nasty gossip and rumors or social exclusion is just as real and just as harmful. Relational bullying peaks during middle school and its perpetrators and victims are usually girls, and unfortunately - most of the time, the bullies get away with and adults never even learn about it. Learn more about relational bullying and about what you can do to make sure your child never becomes a victim. It used to be that bullying stopped after school - and once kids and teens were safely home, they could have at least some respite from the harassment endured during the day. Unfortunately, in today's 24/7 connected society, bully victims get no relief as their tormenters continue the attack around the clock through tactics such as vicious emails, the distribution of unflattering photos or videos, online gossip spreading and many others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">Bullying is common, but it's not harmless; in fact, children who get bullied can experience consequences like depression, social anxiety or low self esteem that can last all the way into adulthood. For most GLBT students, bullying and harassment are as much a part of the school day as math or science - and this is a tragedy, because research shows that not only are bullied GLBT teens more likely to drop-out out of school and far more likely to commit suicide, research shows that the trauma of high school endures, and that GLBT students who were heavily bullied in their teens grow into young adults who are far more likely to be depressed or anxious, or to contract an STD. Bullying hurts not only the victim, the aggressors are also at risk of long term harms - such as an increased risk of substance abuse, poor academic performance and even an increased risk of a criminal record. If your child is a victim of bullying, it may be because he is the sort of child who has difficulty standing up for himself. Bullies look for easy targets, because that makes them feel powerful. If you can teach a child not to respond to bullying, to walk away, bullies are less likely to press that child. Kids who are constantly bullied and not protected will develop symptoms of PTSD -- constant anxiety, constant fear, idiosyncratic behaviors to compensate for those feelings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">They'll fall behind in their development. Dealing with bullies requires holding them strictly accountable for the abusive, hurtful or disrespectful things that they do to feel powerful. You can't kid yourself that it will go away on its own. If adolescent bullies are not stopped, and not taught more appropriate ways to solve problems, they become abusive parents, spouses and bosses. If a child is being bullied at school and his parents just take over the situation, then he's powerless on both ends. Be encouraging, give him a chance to work it out, offer some help and ideas. &#8226; DO NOT minimize the anguish this causes your child and attempt to sweep it under the rug.</paragraph><paragraph parID="142">If the subject is uncomfortable for you, you need to explore your responses-- independent of your child &#8226; DO NOT stop asking questions when your child rejects your overtures with eye-rolling, accusations of prying, and informs you that it is 'impossible for you to understand.' Get a sense of your adolescent's reality. &#8226;DO NOT take phrases like " As If that's going to bother me" "like I care" or other expressions of indifference at face value. This may be an indication of your teen shutting down--numbing herself to the pain. Keep asking questions--stay in the conversation. &#8226;DO NOT take your child's failure to confide in you, or rejections of your norms &amp;amp; 'solutions', personally.</paragraph><paragraph parID="143">Their issues are not about you, but about their relationship to social groups -(even though you may consider their choices a reflection on you.) Actively seek out other adults -or older children of your friends -who might 'mentor' -and become a confidante of-- your child. What can I do if my child is a victim? Bullying can be very hurtful and damaging to the victims, however it's never too late to change your behaviour. The strategy that helps tenth graders understand what bullying behavior looks like is not likely to help preschoolers - in fact, bullying looks entirely different in preschool than it does in tenth grade. It may be far easier, for example, to keep a group of children from bullying in a youth group that meets once a week than it would be to keep that same group from those behaviors in a week-long stay at summer camp. The fact is, however, that dealing with bullying in ONE area of a child's life can turn everything around for them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">It can rear its ugly head in any situation where there are differences in power and people who choose to use that power to hurt others. From graffiti scrawled on a locker at the gym to the boss who constantly belittles subordinates to the sister who gives her little brother a smack to make him do what she wants, bullies are everywhere. But bullying can leave children feeling lonely, unhappy, and unsafe and think that there must be something wrong with them. Amid everything else we're doing, Building Respect, Acceptance and Voice through Education - BRAVE - is a critical part of the work of keeping our children safe and offering them the best education possible. Bullying isn't a minor issue that we don't have time to address. But kids are bullied for many other reasons as well, and sometimes no reason. They are targeted for their appearance or size; sexuality or gender identity; race, ethnicity or religion; their disability; or just because they are "different."</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">Altogether, more than 160,000 children nationwide stay home from school every day to avoid bullying. Both kids who are bullied and kids who bully face significant health and academic risks as a result. Kids who are bullied have lower GPAs and test scores and are more likely to drop out of school. Bullying also negatively affects the atmosphere of an entire school and disrupts the learning environment. "I always say how bullied I am, but no one listens ... . What do I have to do so people will listen to me?" he wrote on his Tumblr account on Sept. 9.</paragraph><paragraph parID="146">As a teacher, I read those words wondering: If Jamey had been a student of mine, could I have made a difference? That takes many, many different forms. In the case of bullying, it means being visible and vocal allies for children who are targeted, it means learning more about the problem and effective tools for combatting it, and it means offering concrete resources to kids who need help. With our BRAVE campaign, the UFT is doing all of those things. When bullying takes place, it affects everyone. For certain populations, most notably lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) kids, the problem is much bigger: 85 percent of LGBT students are verbally harassed, 40 percent are physically harassed and 19 percent are physically assaulted at school. They are more prone to depression, anxiety, suicidal inclinations and physical health problems.</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">Those who bully others, meanwhile, are also more likely to drop out of school, and they face higher risks of developing substance abuse problems, becoming domestic abusers and ending up with a criminal record. Trying to find out what is happening in the lives of some children can be a little like getting blood from a stone. They can resist all your attempts to find out what is happening or see your interest as prying or meddling. Other children can be a little like open books - they are talkative and readily part with information about all manner of things. Children are often reluctant to discuss bullying with their parents so it helps to be on the lookout for warning signs. Acting out : This includes outward signs such displays of unusual aggression at home, talking about hating school and getting into trouble more often. Acting in : This includes more subtle behaviour changes such as sullenness, withdrawing from usual activities, being uncommunicative, feigned illness, bed-wetting and altered sleep patterns.</paragraph><paragraph parID="148">Telltale signs : This includes more obvious physical signs such as torn clothes, items missing, altered route school routes and physical injuries. Children who are bullied usually display a combination of these signs. Children often find it hard to communicate that they are being bullied. Some don't have the language required. Sometimes kids are also reluctant to tell adults about bullying, as they fear that they will take the matter out of their hands, so your approach needs to be gentle and non-judgmental. 1. 2.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">3. Many kids feel ashamed, or even believe what bullies tell them. Kids who know what bullying is can better identify it. They can talk about bullying if it happens to them or others. Kids need to know ways to safely stand up to bullying and how to get help. Encourage the child to report bullying  if it happens. Give tips, like using humor and saying "stop" directly and confidently.</paragraph><paragraph parID="150">Talk about strategies for staying safe, such as staying near adults or groups of other kids. Sometimes spending 15 minutes a day talking can reassure kids that they can talk to their parents if they have a problem. What was one good thing that happened today? Have you ever felt scared to go to school because you were afraid of bullying? Identifying and Defining Types of Bullying Materials: butcher paper, markers Time: 30-45 minutes There are four types of bullying I discuss with my students: verbal, physical, social and intimidation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="151">(Physical can leave marks, verbal can be heard, social bullying is heard by others. Intimidation can come in the form of a look, gesture, or a comment. I divide the class into four groups and ask each to define one type of bullying. I ask them to think about what it looks like, feels like and sounds like. They brainstorm a list on butcher paper. As a class we discuss what has been written and add any terms that may be missing that others find important. In my experience it is easy for the students to identify verbal and physical bullying, but they tend to struggle with social and intimidation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="152">With some guiding questions the students are able to identify these forms of bullying. Many then take it a step further by stating social and intimidation as being the precursors to verbal and physical bullying. A key part to these lessons is helping the student to understand the progression of bullying; if it is not stopped right away, bullying only escalates. I use "just kidding" actions students experience as an example. We talk about these supposedly lighter comments made right after students insult or threaten a classmate that are intended to make bullying a joke and acceptable. "You are such an idiot ... just kidding." "I am going to kick your butt ... just kidding."</paragraph><paragraph parID="153">If a person hears this too often, they may begin to believe the threat or insult. We discuss the importance of recognizing that these comments are still bullying even if they are followed with "just kidding." Not doing so and therefore accepting the insult will only empower the bully to take the next step. Now that the students have some background vocabulary I ask them to put it to the test. I like using movies and stories to help my students identify some of the behaviors we have discussed or they have experienced. All of the clips contain instances of bullying (useful films include "The Mighty," "Stand By Me," "Boyz 'n the Hood," "Devil's Arithmetic," "Angus," "The Mighty Ducks" and "The Kid"). This helps them to practice the vocabulary at a time when they are not emotionally involved personally with the situation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="154">Symptom Checker The White House offered moral leadership and Facebook contributed technology in a joint effort yesterday to attack the problem of bullying. The Obamas kicked off a summit on the issue with the observation that bullying, once considered "just a harmless rite of passage or an inevitable part of growing up" has become increasingly destructive to children, as the internet and social networks have amplified its reach and its virulence. They encouraged parents to set the tone for children by modeling tolerance and empathy themselves, and letting kids know bullying isn't acceptable. Facebook rolled out new "social reporting" tools aimed at encouraging victims of bullying to use their own networks to combat it. They offer a Facebook user who's disturbed by something that's been posted about her easy-to-use tools to (1) ask the person who posted it privately to take it down, (2) report it to Facebook, and (3) report it privately to a "trusted adult" in her network. 10/29/07 &#151; What Schools are Doing to Fight Bullying &#151; How one school's bullying prevention program works</paragraph><paragraph parID="155">If Your Child Is Bullied &#151; Signs and signals that your child may be bullied and how to talk about it &#151; #2 6-year-old Bullied, Beaten at Elementary School The following videos are segments from a Highmark Healthy High 5 special broadcast on bullying and contain information to help parents, children, and educators tackle bullying.

Imbalance of Power : people who bully use their power to control or harm and the people being bullied may have a hard time defending themselves Intent to Cause Harm : actions done by accident are not bullying; the person bullying has a goal to cause harm Repetition : incidents of bullying happen to the same the person over and over by the same person or group Verbal : name-calling, teasing, saying or writing mean, hurtful things Social : spreading rumors, leaving people out on purpose, breaking up friendships, not talking to someone on purpose, making someone feel uncomfortable or scared, making someone do something that they do not want to do</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">Physical : hitting, punching, shoving, kicking, threatening, taking or damaging their things Cyberbullying : using the Internet, mobile phones or other digital technologies to harm others Girls are generally more often involved in indirect forms of aggression, such as excluding others, rumor spreading and unpleasant manipulating of situations to hurt those they do not like.

When your child is being bullied, it's hard to concentrate on anything else-all you want to do is make it stop immediately. Janet Lehman, MSW explains what you can do to help your child-and what could hurt them in the long run. The lesson for our son was that while he couldn&#65533;t stop people from saying bad things, he had some control over how he responded to it. We all have our trials and tribulations with our kids, no matter who we are. Is Your Child Being Bullied? At some point, your child will be picked on or will have his feelings hurt by others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">In my opinion, bullying is a real problem that needs to be solved as a family. Our son was bullied in middle school and high school. Soon, he started to come home with some very disturbing stories about how other kids were teasing him, calling names and taunting him. These children didn't have any clear reason why they were bullying our son other than he was the new kid; he was perceived as being different. Our son would come home each day with terrible stories about things that had happened. Our son was upset and depressed, and it broke our hearts. Here are 9 steps you can take when your child is being bullied.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">Listen to what your child has to say: Being a good listener is an important piece of your role when your child is being bullied . One of the best questions you can ask your child is, "What can I do to be helpful?" When your child tells you what's going on at school, as much as it hurts to listen, be open and able to hear what he has to say. The other side of listening is not blaming your child. Don't put the responsibility for the bullying on him or try to find a reason for it; there is no good reason or excuse for what's happening. If your child is being bullied, he is the victim, so trying to find a reason for why he's "bringing it on himself" really isn't helpful. Never blame your child because it makes him anxious and reduces what he's going to tell you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">Your goal is that he continues to communicate what's going on. If you were bullied as a child, try not to personalize what is happening. If you were bullied when you were younger, the same situation with your child will most likely bring up painful memories. It's okay to connect with your child about how it feels to be bullied, but don't take the problem on as if it's yours alone. I think the most important thing to do when your child is bullied is to remember the responses you received from others that were-or weren't-helpful. Use what worked and avoid doing what was unsupportive or hurtful. Don't retaliate against the bully or his family .</paragraph><paragraph parID="172">As tempting as it might be to take matters into your own hands and retaliate against the bully or his family, don't do it. This is where you have to set some examples for your child on how to problem solve. It's very difficult to hear that your child is being threatened; of course you want to immediately stop the hurt. But remember, retaliating won't help your child solve the problem or feel better about himself. Instead, take a deep breath and think about what you can do to help your child handle what he's facing. Coach your child on how to react: Bullies tend to pick on people who they can get a reaction from; they choose kids who get upset and who take the teasing to heart. They also look for kids who won't stand up for themselves, or who they can overpower.</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">We coached our son on how to avoid bullies at school and who to go to if he felt unsafe. We also did role plays together where we practiced not reacting to what the bullies said. He couldn't stop the bullying right away, but he could get himself away from it and he could find someone to talk to about it. Find a teacher or administrator at your child's school who will help: Remember, it is the school's responsibility to stop bullying; I think most take that seriously. After he started talking with her, she let him know that he could just sit in her office, even if she wasn't there; the school allowed him to basically take a time out or break to get away from the bullying situation. Take your child's side: When our son was being bullied, we constantly reaffirmed that there were things he could do to handle the situation, and that he was in fact doing them. We let him know that we were going to get him help and that we loved him and we were going to support him.</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">Make sure to let your child know that you're on his side; he needs to understand that you don't blame him and that you will support him. Our son was bullied physically and verbally, and we told him that he could do what he needed to do to protect himself. We told him that he would still have consequences at school for any misbehavior because that would be against the rules, but we didn't add to them at home. Get support: Be sure to talk to your spouse or to supportive family or friends. Sometimes I would burst out crying after hearing about what had happened to our son. There were definitely times when James and I got angry. I think the bottom line is that this situation can really bring out emotions from parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">We found that we needed to talk with each other about this as a couple because it was so hurtful, and because we wanted to be clear in how we communicated to our son. I recommend that single parents reach out to somebody-a family member, friend, or someone at the school-anyone who can help you help your child. Teach your child to name what's happening: For younger kids, it's important to be able to name what's happening as "bullying." For a child who's feeling picked on, it's empowering to be able to really name it. They're teaching a lot about bullying prevention in school these days and "bully" is such a negative word that it's good for your child to be able to attach it to the behavior. This is truly empowering for many children and can work with older kids, as well. Find something your child is really good at doing: Help your child feel good about himself by finding something he can do well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="176">Choose some activities he's good at and reinforce it verbally. Our son got involved in swimming and it was very helpful for his self-esteem. Fortunately, he got through that year and developed some great friendships. That summer we signed him up for a summer camp program. He went there still feeling a bit like a victim, and came out a completely different human being. Camp was a place where he really excelled and it just fed his self-esteem. So try to find a positive experience for your child to help him feel good about himself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="177">Remember, every time he succeeds, it helps him develop better self-esteem; that feeling is the opposite of how the bullies make him feel. Bullying is not something your child is going to get over immediately-or simply because he wants it to be over. It can be long a process. The lesson for our son was that while he couldn't stop people from saying bad things, he had some control over how he responded to it. Look at it this way: a lot of people feel stuck in their jobs. Overcoming a bullying episode takes support, and it takes everyone working together as a family to make it happen. Signs that your child is being bullied:</paragraph><paragraph parID="178">Not going to the bathroom at school. A lot of bullies attack in the bathroom, away from cameras and adults. Avoiding unsupervised activities and areas. Getting upset after a phone call, text or email. Losing friends they previously had. Being more isolated and skipping activities that they used to enjoy. Spending more time alone in their rooms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">Making negative statements about themselves and engaging in negative self talk. If it is allowed to continue, the bullying escalates - steadily. Take all of this advice, my children were in the People Magazine article and one thing that holds true not stated above is that when your child says they have no friends that is a sure sign or nobody likes me. the worst feeling is to see your child being bullied and afraid they may harm themselves. He punches and kicks him and my provider tells me this. There was another incident at my neighbor's where the kids were playing in their backyard and the kids were throwing rocks at my son. His main trouble comes at lunchtime when no one wants him to sit with them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">In the last six months, two boys were taken out of school in ambulances because they were beaten by bullies. And according to other kids in his class and schoolmates, these two boys have been causing lots of troubles, bullying a number of kids who they assumed will not fight back. My 5th grader was pushed into a desk chair and then shoved down then the kid bowed up in his face. Today was the first time I had heard of anything physical happening to him, but he has been putting up with verbal bullying regularly this year. He has not withdrawn or stopped liking school, so I have felt like he has been handling it. We addressed the verbal stuff with his teachers earlier in the year but it has not stopped these particular boys from saying this--though I do believe it is not quite as frequent. Once a child puts their hands on my child things change dramatically.</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">They listened and said some good things, but always made sure to ask questions that seemed to put some of the guilt on him, like, "Did you respond back?"

(Start with you being the victim and them being the bully, and ask them what you (as the victim) should try this time. Then switch roles and ask them what you (as the bully) would say.</paragraph><paragraph parID="184">When he defends himself, he is the one who gets into trouble, not the bully. He did not want to return to school. He was frightened since this kid was physically larger than him. It is hard to try and figure out a solution at his age because he doesn't truly understand what is going on (he is still trying to learn what is right and wrong) and at his age gives "great" reactions to bullies. His personality became more aggressive and his attention in class was non existant, causing everyone to point the finger at him as the problem child. Your article has touched a nerve for many parents who can relate to your pain of having your child bullied. My 12-year-old is being relentlessly taunted and bullied at school, and the administration has done very little to help the situation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">Last night, in tears, he looked at me and said, "I wish I had never been born." It truly is a heartbreaking one, as are all the other stories on here about kids being bullied and tormented. You might also decide to seek some additional support for your son regarding how to respond when he is bullied and how to cope with the feelings of sadness he experiences because of it. It's National Bullying Prevention Month, For any interpreter who works with children, or has children of their own, this is a very telling article for the month. It's National Bullying Prevention Month, and until really recently, I was feeling pretty smug that my kids - ages 4, 6 and 8 - had largely escaped either being a bully or being bullied. To be a bully , it seemed you had to torment your peers. To be bullied, it seemed you had to be the tormented.</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">"In the old days, bullying was getting pushed around on the playground," she says. "Now we've realized that both verbal and physical abuse have consequences. " A lot of adults think that kids should only have positive relationships, but that's not possible. Moreover, they're almost beside the point: if a kid - or his mom - feels like another child is being mean for the sake of being mean, it's time to pay attention. Although he has no problem telling his squabbling sisters where to get off, he turns meek when it comes to speaking up for himself outside his family circle. Bullying sends kids to nurse for more than injury NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Both bullies and their victims take more trips to the nurse's office than other students - but not just for the obvious reasons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">In a new study published today in Pediatrics, kids involved in bullying were more likely to see the school nurse for illnesses and non-medical symptoms, in addition to injuries. Enlisting school nurses could be "another way of trying to keep a gauge of what's happening among the students in school," Eric Vernberg of the University of Kansas in Lawrence, the study's lead author, told Reuters Health. "A lot of times, kids may experience some conflict, some bullying, and not involve the teacher or not tell a parent or not tell anybody really," he said, "particularly for a kid that's embarrassed about the difficulty they're having or afraid that saying things about it is going to make it worse in some way." The finding means that school nurses could be the front line for spotting cases of bullying and bringing them to a stop. Recently, evidence has been piling up that being bullied can take a psychological toll on kids -- both during the bullying and later, when they are adults. And some fear that bullying is becoming more common, with the internet providing a new and potentially anonymous outlet for harassment. In the fall, every kid filled out questionnaires about how often they were bullied -- which included everything from being the target of rumors to getting hit or kicked -- as well as who the aggressive kids were in their class.</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">At the end of the year, the researchers collected logs from the school nurses and determined how often each kid went to the nurse and the reason for those visits. Bullied kids and those identified as bullies by their peers had more visits to the nurse than other students for an illness, injury, or for complaints that didn't have a clear medical cause, such as stomach aches. The researchers noted that boys and girls as well as kids of different races were just as likely to be bullied, but that boys and African-American kids were more likely to be labeled as aggressors than other students. Sometimes, the link between bullying and a nurse's visit may be clear -- such as when a kid gets injured in a fight related to bullying. In other cases, it might not be as obvious. Vernberg pointed to evidence that the long-term psychological stress brought on by bullying could compromise kids' immune systems and make them vulnerable to sickness. And some bullied kids might just be looking for an escape from the hallways or playground and seek refuge with the school nurse, the researchers note.</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">Bullies themselves may also be targets of aggression or shunned by their peers. "When you're a bully at elementary school you're more likely to be excluded from playground games. (Other kids) don't want to be friends with you," Dr. Tom Tarshis, the medical director of the Bay Area Children's Association in Cupertino, California, told Reuters Health. Especially at a young age, "a lot of bullies have the same mental health problems as the victims do," said Tarshis, who has studied bullying but was not involved in the current research. Keeping track of nurse's visits is one way that schools can keep an eye out for who might be involved in bullying, Vernberg said. But it's only one piece of the picture. "The schools need to step up and be the most important component in any intervention.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">It can't just be going in the classroom and giving a couple talks," Tarshis said. "We have to make sure the teachers are on board, the parents, the administrators, and the whole community."

Bullying can negatively affect children who observe bullying going on around them-even if they aren't targeted themselves. Children who are bystanders to bullying can feel fearful ("Maybe I'll be targeted next!") , guilty ("I should do something to stop this, but I'm afraid to.") , and distracted from school work. Bullying can contribute to a negative social climate at school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">Bullying is a form of victimization or abuse, and it is wrong. Children should be able to attend school or take part in community activities without fear of being harassed, assaulted, belittled, or excluded. Warning Signs The first obstacle to stopping this abusive, harmful, and unacceptable behavior is to recognize the common characteristics associated with bullying behavior. At times, the bully may be so versed at manipulation, that no signs are present at all. A Bully Often: Seeks to dominate and/or manipulate others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">Enjoys feeling powerful and in control (whether real or not) Is both a poor winner (boastful and arrogant) and a poor loser Seems to derive satisfaction from other's fears, discomfort, or pain Is good at hiding behaviors or doing them where adults can't notice Is excited by conflicts between others Blames others for his/her problems Displays uncontrolled anger</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">Has a history of discipline problems Displays a pattern of impulsive and chronic hitting, intimidating, and aggressive behaviors Has difficulty in following rules Displays intolerance and prejudice towards others May use drugs, alcohol or be a member of a gang Lacks empathy towards others. Many children and teens have one or two of the above warning signs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">It doesn't mean that they are a bully. The warning signs are just that - a signal that the potential exists for the child to be a bully. The more warning signs that exist, however, the higher the likelihood of a child engaging in bullying behavior. Below is a simple questionnaire that will ask a series of yes or no questions to assist you in deciding if you or someone you love is a bully. Questions to Ask Have you ever punched, shoved, or hit another person? In reading comments and stories from children, in talking to children who are bullied or witness bullying, in speaking with the bullies themselves, one statement is made with heart-breaking regularity:</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">It's difficult to believe that there are millions of adults turning their backs on children being bullied. Every seven seconds, a child is bullied. Three children out of every four report having been bullied at least once in their lives. One child in every four reports being bullied frequently. One child in every four admits to bullying others regularly. Children who are bullied are more likely than other children to have lower self-esteem; higher rates of depression, loneliness, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. They also are more likely to want to avoid attending school and have higher school absenteeism rates.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">Recent research on the health-related effects of bullying indicates that victims of frequent bullying are more likely to experience headaches, sleeping problems, and stomach ailments. Some emotional scars can be long-lasting. Some people would have us believe that this is exactly the kind of zero-tolerance policy that is needed to stop bullies. And, as experts and educators know, the child who is bullied in the morning may turn around and bully another child in the afternoon. Whether they're large urban public schools or small private ones, schools need to stop blaming individual students and look to themselves. In terms of teen suicide due to sexual identity or perceived identity, I'd have to say to you that there isn't much progress there....the recent rash still only includes what has been reported. And as far as what a person is bullied for, anything to a teen can be huge, from acne to race and sexually orientation (which are huge).</paragraph><paragraph parID="199">As we get older, most of us become more confident and comfortable with ourselves and learn how to deal with small minded people. But "social reporting" may not be a hit with kids-even bullied ones. There is nothing new about bullying, which leads many adults to believe that children just need to get used to it. However, there have been studies that give us knowledge and understanding of the impact bullying has on both victims and the bullies themselves. More information on this topic may be found on the Cyberbullying Research Center Website " . Some are obvious such as physical or verbal bullying, but types exist that on the surface may not be as noticeable, such as emotional, racist, sexual, or cyberbullying. If you are worried that you or someone you know may be at risk for suicide, please call 911, contact a mental health professional, or call and talk to someone at 1-800-SUICIDE.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">Bullying usually takes place when a person feels threatened. But a new KidsHealth&#174; KidsPoll exploring bullying in school-age children reveals that the problem is extremely prevalent in both boys and girls: 86% of kids surveyed said they've seen someone else being bullied, 48% said they've been bullied, and 42% admitted to bullying other kids at least once in a while (15% of those admit to bullying every day). Although more than half of the students participating in the KidsPoll said they're never been bullied, it's still a problem for many: 33% said they're bullied once in a while and 15% said they're bullied at least weekly. Bullies often target someone who is different than others and focus on that attribute. Wearing glasses, having big ears, or being in a wheelchair are all differences that can be fodder for a bully's ridicule. But a child doesn't have to be physically different from other children to be bullied. Being anxious , insecure, smarter, or slower than their peers can also make some kids the target of bullying.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">Sometimes the effects of bullying aren't as obvious as a black eye. If you suspect your child is being bullied, keep an eye out for these signs: sudden appearance of bruises missing belongings changing routines the invention of mysterious illnesses or stomachaches to avoid going to school (14% of the children surveyed for the KidsPoll said being bullied can make them afraid to go to school) And what are the children being bullied doing about it?</paragraph><paragraph parID="202">Of the kids surveyed who said they've been bullied, a staggering 46% said they respond by "fighting back" (a solution that can often make the situation worse). According to the poll, boys were more likely to say they would "fight back" than girls (53% of boys vs. 38% of girls), while girls were more likely to say they would "talk to an adult" than boys (32% of girls vs. 19% of boys). But the good news is that more than half of the students participating in the KidsPoll said they do something other than fight, such as: talk to an adult (25%) just walk away and do nothing (20%) try to talk to the bully (9%) Even if children haven't been the targets of bullying, many have seen it happen to others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">The KidsPoll participants said they: say or do something to try and stop it (41%) tell someone who could help (23%) join in (20%) do nothing (16%) According to the poll, older children were more likely to say they would "join in" or "watch and do nothing," while younger children were more likely to "say or do something to try to stop it" or "tell someone who could help." Coping Skills and Techniques:</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">Ask your child(ren) directly if they are being bullied. Refuse to keep the bullying a secret. Arrange to meet your child(ren) at school when it is most likely to occur. Make it clear to your child(ren) it is important to avoid the bully altogether. Report the bullying to school officials. Reassure your child it is not their fault they have been bullied. Teach your child it's okay to walk away, report it, and to stay away from the bully(ies).</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">Sign your child up for an activity they really like (it   is important to build self-esteem). Teach your child bullies are insecure, have a low self-esteem, and pick on others to make themselves look and feel better. Stop Bullying Bobby!

There are red flags parents should watch for that might indicate your child is being cyber bullied.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">Here's what to look for-and what to do. Over the last year, we've read about horrific tragedies-bullycides-that appear to have been prompted by relentless peer bullying. One child tragically ending his or her young life due to vicious peer cruelty is one child is too many. So let's get savvy about electronic cruelty and the new digital age our kids are experiencing. Online bullying is especially hurtful. Those horrid, vicious, untrue comments, with a quick click of a button, hit cyberspace. There is no telling how many other peers are hearing or reading those cold-blooded attacks.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">Can you imagine being the recipient of such hate? Can you imagine if your child was that recipient? The truth is those clicks are happening all too often, which is why parents must get educated. Our first step to turn this around is to understand why cyberbullying is, and then recognize possible warning signs. These are serious lessons - they might save a child. That's my hope. What is cyberbullying?</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">Cyberbullying is an electronic form of communication that uses cyber-technology (the internet) or digital media (Facebook and other social media sites) to hurt, threaten, embarrass, annoy, blackmail or otherwise target another minor. Every adult who interacts with kids-parents, educators, librarians, police, pediatricians, coaches, child care givers-must get educated about this lethal new form of bullying so they can find ways to help stop this. One reason for such a dramatic increase in cyber-abuse is that it's just so much easier to be cruel when you don't have to do lash out with vicious insinuations face to face, and can instead do so anonymously! Where we once thought we just had to protect children from adult predators using the Internet, but now we need to shield kids from one another. Cyber-bullying is real, and incidents are happening at an increasing rate. Here's a reality check: National surveys by online safety expert Parry Aftab estimate that 85 percent of 12 and 13-year olds have had experience with cyber bullying. And 53 percent say they have been bullied online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">Research proves that when kids are left unsupervised and without behavior expectations traditional bullying thrives. And we may not be doing as good a job as we think. Another survey found that while 93 percent of parents feel they have a good idea of what their kids are doing on the Internet, 41 percent of our kids say they don't share with us what they do or where they go online. Open up that dialogue and listen! Red flag warning signs of cyber bullying As parents, we must do a better job of tuning into our kids.

Send the list to the local newspaper to print. Ask your child's school to post the list on their website. Get active and get your community involved. Here's what to watch out for: Your son is hesitant to be online or unexpectedly stops or avoids using the computer Your daughter is nervous when an instant message, text, or email appears</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">Your son is visibly upset, angry, or depressed after using the computer or his cell phone Your daughter hides or clears the computer screen or her cell phone screen when you enter or doesn't want to talk about online activity Your son starts using the computer when you're not in the room Your daughter keeps going back and forth to check the computer screen in shorter spurts Your son withdraws from friends; wants to avoid school or peer activities; is uneasy about going outside in general; an/or pulls away from family members Your daughter is suddenly sullen, evasive withdrawn, or has a marked change in personality or behavior Your son has trouble sleeping, loss of appetite, is excessively moody, cries easily, or seems depressed</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">Suspicious phone calls, e-mails, and packages arrives at your home Your child has a drop in academic performance or falls behind in schoolwork A key that you shouldn't overlook is a sudden change-something that isn't t your child's "normal" behavior-that lasts daily, for at least two weeks.

Bullying behavior can include teasing, insulting someone (particularly about their weight or height, race, sexuality, religion or other personal traits), shoving, hitting, excluding someone, or gossiping about someone. It can involve children of any age, including younger elementary grade-schoolers and even kindergarteners. Bullying behavior is frequently repeated unless there is intervention. When you look him/her straight in the eye, he/she will begin to shrink. Be assertive. Be involved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">Schoolyard bullying is far more serious than just name-calling and teasing. It's escalated to include harassment, beatings and even death threats. In it, 65 percent of middle school and junior high students said they had been assaulted or harassed in the previous year. It's gotten so bad that she's even asked her mom if they can move. Bullying can be pushing, shoving, hitting, and spitting, as well as name calling, picking on, making fun of, laughing at, and excluding someone.

Whether internet access comes via the computer, phone, or other technological devices, keeping children safe from the many dangers of the internet can seem impossible. One of these dangers is known as cyber bullying. Studies have shown that nearly 42% of kids have been bullied in the online environment. To fully understand the dangers of cyber bullying and how it can affect children, one must be knowledgeable of the facts that surround the crime. Getting the word out about how prevalent the problem is and teaching parents how to use internet control as a method of protection, will help combat the problem.</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">What is Cyber Bullying? Cyber bullying is bullying that takes place online or through text messaging. Many people have the misconception that cyberbullying can only take place on a computer. Like real life bullying, cyber bullying often knows no boundaries and has extended far beyond having access to a computer. The popular website dosomething.org states that "The psychological and emotional outcomes of cyber bullying are similar to real-life bullying outcomes, except for the reality that with cyber bullying there is often no escape. School ends at 3 p.m., while the Internet is available all the time." The intent of cyber bullying is to hurt someone emotionally and the majority of the time, it works.</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">It becomes a constant nuisance in the minds of victims and can have a devastating impact. Recent stories in the news prove that victims of cyber bullying will often go to the extreme to deal with the pain that is caused from being humiliated publicly on social networking sites or through text messaging. Cyber bullying takes such an emotional toll on the victim that for some, suicide seems to be the only way out. The National Crime Prevention Council defines cyber bullying as the following: Sending personal or embarrassing information about a particular person to others using different means of technology Sending threatening text messages or emails Posing as someone else online with intent to embarrass</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">Posting untrue rumors or making accusations on public social networking sites Signs that Your Child is being Cyber Bullied Some of the classic signs of cyber bullying are the same as those seen in a child who has been physically bullied at school, on the playground, or in some other public location. May withdraw themselves from family and friends. Avoid using the internet. Seem stressed out or flustered when receiving text messages or emails. Have an increase in sadness or frustration.</paragraph><paragraph parID="227">Have poor eating and sleeping patterns. Unwilling to attend school events or activities. Children will often deal with the effects of cyber bullying differently. Parents must be coached to recognize the potential warning signs, and seek help once the problem is identified. What Can Parents Do? Combating the problem of cyber bullying must be a collaborative effort between parents, law enforcement, and those who have a willingness to put a stop to it by providing valuable tools for parents. Ultimately, however, the responsibility falls within the hands of parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="228">The Kids @ Facebook survey completed by MinorMonitor found that 74% of parents are worried about their children's safety on the social networking site Facebook. 41% had a particular concern about cyber bullying. This proves that parents are aware of the true dangers that exist. The truth is, however, that kids are often smarter than their parents when it comes to this and quickly learn how to "hide" information with a click of a button. The key now is educating parent and providing them with the tools that they need to help their children stay safe while using the internet and websites such as Facebook. Limit time spent on these social networking sites. This can be a challenge.</paragraph><paragraph parID="229">While limiting time may seem impossible, parents should be encouraged to set rules and guidelines about the amount of time spent on the internet. The more time a child spends on the internet, the greater his or her chances of being a victim of cyber bullying or other internet crimes. Parental control software and websites geared towards protecting children as they use the internet. Both of these suggestions can be valuable tools for parents. Parental control software allows parents to set time limits, restrict websites, and even gives daily reports on the user's online activities. A relatively newer but more efficient solution to help parents combat the dangers of the internet is websites created specifically for that purpose. If parents are going to allow their children to access the internet, they must keep open lines of communication.</paragraph><paragraph parID="230">While some children may see this as an invasion of privacy, the dangers of the internet call for invasive precautionary measures. Parents should talk to children about their activities, know friends and acquaintances they are socializing with on a daily basis, and be aware of any problems that arise. As with many things, communication is the key to unveiling potential dangers that target children as they use the internet. A Call To Action The statistics are alarming. Cyber bullying is a global problem that children will face on a day to day basis. With social networking becoming increasingly popular, the problem is only going to continue to grow.</paragraph><paragraph parID="231">Parents, educators, law enforcement and other helpful agencies must all ban together to help children realize the dangers of the internet. Beginning with parental controls of the internet, there are many helpful ways to lessen the effects of cyber bullying on children. The New York State Division of Justice Services lists the following as warning signs that can alert parents to potential cyber bullying. Children who are cyber bullied: Each page includes an important message about respecting others, valuing differences, and being a friend. I ignored them because I was scared of what else they might say and who else they might tell if I stood up to them. I didn't know what to do so I stood there, alone and afraid.</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">I just heard that the Motion Picture Association of America has given an "R" rating to "Bully" -- a new film coming out soon that documents the epidemic of bullying in American schools. Because of the R rating, most kids won't get to see this film. No one under 17 will be allowed to see the movie, and the film won't be allowed to be screened in American middle schools or high schools. I can't believe the MPAA is blocking millions of teenagers from seeing a movie that could change -- and, in some cases, save -- their lives. According to the film's website, over 13 million kids will be bullied this year alone. If enough people speak out and ask the MPAA to give Bully a PG-13 rating, maybe we can get them to change their minds. Will you sign my petition to the MPAA asking for a PG-13 rating instead of an R?</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">From what I understand, the MPAA ruled by ONE vote that Bully deserves an R-rating because of "language," robbing many teenagers of the chance to view a film that could change their lives, and help reduce violence in schools. It means that a film documenting the abuse that millions of kids experience through bullying won't be seen by the audience that needs to see it the most: middle school students and high school students. Please sign my petition and demand that the MPAA give "Bully" a PG-13 so this important film can be seen by as many kids and adults as possible. Counselors and teachers must identify those students who are bullies and children who are more likely to be victimized (and both can be easily overlooked). Do not overlook the impact on your bystanders: new research shows that those children are witnessing cruelty and in some cases can begin to display symptoms of PTSD. You'll need to ask the same question for the child who is bullied.
