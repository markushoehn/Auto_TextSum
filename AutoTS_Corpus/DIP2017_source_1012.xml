  <paragraph parID="0">More parents are choosing to homeschool their children because they see the many benefits of homeschooling, differences in ideology and issues with public school policy are only a few reasons why some parents choose homeschooling over public or private schools. Homeschooling is a full-time commitment and to make sure that the child receives a quality education, parents need to invest time and effort needed. In comparison to public schools, where education is free, homeschooling can be costly. Purchasing the newest curriculum and teaching tools can be very expensive. Parents may choose to use a paid homeschooling program, such programs may have added benefits, but may increase the cost of the child's education. There are also other costs to keep in mind, like project materials, stationery, books, computer software, and field trips. Parents who choose to home school their children should be prepared to spend more money than parents who send their children to public schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">Home schooled children may not have as many opportunities to interact with other children in comparison to children who attend regular schools. Forming bonds and socializing with children their own age is important for the child's developmental health and development of social skills. If home schooled, they may be deprived of the chance to form friendships and may suffer socially. Of course, they can make friends with other home schooled children, but it is quite different when special effort has to be made to arrange meetings. The lack of socialization may affect them in later stages of life. Lack of Facilities It is quite impossible that a home can be as well-equipped as a regular school in terms of facilities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">For classes that require experiments like physics and chemistry, it can be hard to get all the necessary chemicals, materials, apparatus, and so on. The home would also lack facilities for sports like swimming pools, running tracks, gyms, and fields. One of the reasons why homeschooling is bad is the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parents may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner. It is may be hard for parents to draw the line between educator and parent in the child's mind. One of the most glaring negative effects of homeschooling is the matter of motivation. Some children need to be challenged to excel in their studies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">In this sense, they thrive when they are involved in some competition. Children who are homeschooled would not have this motivation because most of them are educated separately. Follow these links to learn more about the homeschooling versus public school debate. The Negative Effects and Aspects of Homeschooling When considering enrolling a child in a homeschool curriculum, there are many different factors to consider. While there are many positive aspects of homeschooling, there are also the negative aspects of homeschooling. In this article, we will explore some of the disadvantages of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">When parents take the responsibility of educating their children at home, they may need to set aside time to make it work. The task of homeschooling a child is certainly not easy, especially for working parents, single parents or stay-at-home parents. They have to take time to organize and prepare lessons, teach, give tests, and plan field trips. Homeschooling is one alternative parents should consider when faced with a nonresolvable, harmful conflict. The current public school atmosphere can be detrimental to many students. Private schools still retain, however, the limitations that are intrinsic to the classroom method of instruction. Not all public schools do consistently well in handling children with special needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="5">A conflict with a child's school is never pleasant, especially when the school is unwilling or unable to work with the child's parents to resolve the conflict. Many parents prefer smaller individualized programs for their children, where they can help shape their child s values and belief systems. Last Will and Testament Class size The benefits of smaller classes are now widely acknowledged. Few education issues have been studied more than the effect of class size on student achievement. But until Tennessee s longitudinal class-size study - Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) project - results were contradictory and inconclusive.</paragraph><paragraph parID="6">The STAR project showed that those enrolled in small classes as youngsters were more likely to: Graduate on time - 72 percent of students, versus 66 percent from regular classes and 65 percent from classes with a paraprofessional. Complete more advanced math and English courses. Complete high school - 19 percent dropped out, versus 23 percent from regular classes and 26 percent from classes with a paraprofessional. Graduate with honors. State-determined Education Though many people, if not most, probably think public schools are controlled at the local level, this is only partially the case.</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">State constitutions and governments define how each state's schools are to be organized and run, what subjects are to be taught, what curriculum may be used and how teachers will be trained and certified. Certain federal laws add some requirements, and some federally funded programs also influence what is taught by schools. Besides basic subjects - reading, English, math, science, history - many states also require teaching sex education, drug abuse prevention, "diversity," and so on. The curriculum screening process, while ostensibly intended for quality-control purposes, by reviewing and pre-selecting a few textbooks out of the many available for each subject, has become an out-of-public-view means by which issue-oriented advocacy groups have often gotten their agendas written into the curricular materials mandated for use by a state s school children. The local school s ability to maintain campus and classroom discipline is compromised by restrictions that society (e.g., federal and state courts, threats of lawsuits from civil liberties groups) imposes on the school. Where once teachers, school administrators and parents usually worked in cooperation in the education and discipline of their students, now many parents and "rights" groups defend student wrong-doers, setting up an adversarial relationship between parents and schools where discipline is concerned. And should a teacher prove to be incompetent or worse, tenure rules and teachers unions make removing a problem teacher from the classroom extremely difficult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="8">Non-individualized Mass Education In the classroom, the teacher has a class of 20 or 25 children and textbooks that are supposed to be covered within the school year. At this point, the teacher doesn t know where the students are academically, in what way each student learns most easily or the students interests. The textbooks define what teaching methods will be used and the pace at which the teacher will teach the subject. The size of the class limits how much flexibility the teacher has to slow the pace of instruction or supplement for students having difficulties and how much individual instruction time the teacher is able to give such students. It would be impractical for the teacher and for the class to have individual students or groups of students proceeding through the subject material at multiple paces. Though the supposed intent of education is to prepare students for real life, schools segregate students into classrooms by age, not because this bears any resemblance to real life, but solely for the convenience of the school as an institution and the teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="9">In a public school, most of a student s time is spent with children of the same age. The child may find friends with interests similar to the family s, interests that encourage learning and becoming a good citizen. Likewise, a child may encounter children who decide to bully them or exclude them and make the child s school life generally miserable. And a child may find friends whose interests will lead the child into antisocial and dangerous behaviors. The public school has very limited ability (and sometimes little will) to protect bullied students or guide students away from bad influences and have a difficult time enforcing discipline. What is easily forgotten, however, is that a disruptive child or two can bring so much turmoil to a classroom that even an excellent teacher cannot teach and that students who are eager to learn cannot learn as they desire. Inadequate campus or classroom discipline allowing distractions is not a problem in homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="10">Private Schools At present, private school students are faring much better academically than are their public school counterparts. This reflects several factors. Parents of private school students tend to be more involved in their children's education. Private schools have considerable freedom from government interference, have the freedom to focus on teaching the core academic subjects and select excellent curricular materials without being subjected to pressure from political advocacy groups. Private schools also have much greater freedom to enforce campus and classroom discipline, including receiving greater parental cooperation and participation. Their classes still use a single curriculum that is designed around a single approach to teaching the subject.</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">The teachers still lack flexibility with regard to the pace of class instruction. At a public school (and sometimes a private school), a child does not need to become a troublemaker to find trouble - too often, it comes to the child. Nor do school districts always cooperate with parents who wish to transfer their child to another, better, teacher s class or to another, better, school campus. Homeschooling avoids the risks of poor-quality schools and teachers and with unhelpful school administrators. When you are homeschooling everything you do turns into an educational opportunity. Homeschooling groups abound and you need not worry about a lack of social opportunities for your child. Most homeschoolers avail themselves of a variety of classes to round out the education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">Nightly homework, behavior issues, social concerns, negative behaviors the kids pick up at school, negative attitudes towards learning, trying to get an education that fits a kid who has learning disabilities, who is gifted, or both, or otherwise special. Also kids at school are very peer-oriented, while homeschooled kids are family-oriented. We live in Fremont and have found a wonderful group in the Tri-City area. The group has park days, field trips, social events for parents as well as children. We also joined a homeschool charter school which hosts activities, occasional classes, and provides curriculum help and materials. A few moms of K-aged children in our homeschool group have formed a coop. Every Friday we gather the kids at one house, two moms have the morning off and two moms run a day centered on a theme such as dinosaurs, or apples, space, whatever.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">We read stories and do activities for 3 hours. As for what to do with younger children, somehow you find a way. We have a sand and water table that I put warm soapy water in for my 3-year-old to play with. Sometimes she likes to do workbooks or color or paint while I work with my older daughter. I try to alternate between them so that the little one gets attention, too. How do you decide if it is right for your family? Although she is under the confines of the school district and therefore the State, we would have had a hard time getting started without her.</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">I've been homeschooling my 13yo daughter for 8+ years and her theater/music connections are fulfilled within the larger community, not specifically within the homeschooling community. Homeschooling families in California comply with the compulsory attendance law in one of five ways: * They establish a private school in their home ('48222 exemption). * They enroll their children in a private school that offers an independent study course ('48222 exemption). * They hold, or employ a private tutor holding, a California teaching credential for the grades and subjects being taught ('48224 exemption). * They enroll their children in a public school that offers independent study (public school). * They enroll their children in a public charter school that offers independent study, distance learning, or a homeschool program (public school).</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">Homegrown Kids tends to have younger kids (up to about 8 or 9). It is an overcrowded school in an urban area and the teachers seem too stressed to pay attention to the individual needs of their students. The only thing I felt was missing was academic advisor-which is a function of the principal. Lawerence Hall of Science and the Exploratorium also run homeschool classes. It's one-on-one weekly academic learning meetings, you help your child track their assignments, and they have on-site mentors as well who help track progress. It might be similar to homeschooling. You have to really stay involved, their department also processes homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">We have had various recommendation from professionals (psychological testing, residential schools, tough love). What should the expectations be? But you really, really need to know why he hasn't been going to school. Is he seriously depressed and doesn't think it's worth the effort? Does he have a substance problem? Get professionals involved. concerned My son was in a similar situation last year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">It is FREE charter school that works with students at their own pace, through online courses complemented by teachers. Feel free to contact me if it would be helpful to you. He went to several public schools in Marin K-6, but was often under-challenged academically. He is very creative w/ interests in theater, D&amp;D, math and writing. In Marin ''park days'' were geared more towards younger kids and he has felt out-of-place randomly showing up at parks and trying to make friends. We are trying to figure out the best path to take once we get settled in the east bay. We would like to stick with homeschooling if we can, but might have to consider alternatives.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">Jennifer I don't have any first hand experience with homeschooling but if you "have to consider the alternatives" I hope you consider one of the many fine schools available in Berkeley (and area) that are excellent for drama, the arts and such. As for public schools, our son goes to MLK Middle School, and loves it. There is drama, dance, percussion, band, art, computers, orchestra and chorus, to name a few. Your son's interests match the interests of many of the particants in my after school and summer program. For the last 21 years, the Roleplay Workshop has been providing fun, safe, and supportive programs for youth ages 10 to 18. I feel that 5 days of school 8:00 - 3:00 is just too long for these little ones to stay focused and productive. Then it's the hectic pace of after school programs, having a family dinner, homework and getting ready for bed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">With one day in the middle of the week for homeschooling I feel that it will benefit my children tremendously. First, it will give them a chance to relax a bit in the middle ot the week (my 1st grader asks me every day,''Mommy, how many more days until I am off?'') It will give them a chance to catch up on studies from school that they don't quite understand (and are afraid to ask in front of their peers). And it will give them a chance to learn about things that they are interested in and not just what the school thinks that they should learn. The other day my 6 yr. old daughter asked me to teach her how to sew. Well, that's something we could do on a homeschooling day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">I am not so sure if any school would support this way of thinking and I am not sure why not. (Besides the fact that public schools get paid per child attending classes each day.) If they truly have our children's best interest at heart then I think the schools should look at each child individually. If anyone has any advice on selling this idea to their school please respond. Or if anyone has any other advice about this topic please respond. Thank you. Homeschooling Mom My children attend Wildcat Community Freeschool in Richmond (at the end of Arlington) across the street from Wildcat Canyon and it offers a 3, 4 or 5 school day option.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">Many of us were homeschooling our children until Wildcat opened and it has been an ideal middle ground between homeschooling and school. When we started we sent our son 3 days a week but quickly increased it to 4 becuase he loved being there so much. We still like to keep Mondays open though to go to the zoo or the exploratorium or other outings without the crowds. I think a child who regularly missed school would be somewhat disconnected from the classroom community and the need to bring the child back up to speed every week would be disruptive for the other children. kindergarten parent Thats what I hope to do - either a day at home or taking days as needed to do stuff we love or if he is just overwhelmed and needing to be at home, just like we do now in preschool. So glad you posted this idea...I hadn't thought of it as homeschooling so it is nice to give it a name. A friend of mine is planning on doing the same thing in the fall (K).</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">Seems a 'civilized' way to raise our children - spend time with them...share our values and interests and let them 'be' just kids some times! The school days and weeks are carefully planned out by the teachers and the curriculum is integrated through all subjects. Days are not compartmentalized. It would also be socially awkward for your child because they would not be able to be a stable part of a group of friends. Miss a day, miss a lot I have been thinking about this question a lot over the past week. I am not sure I know what the original poster is looking for. Is she looking for ways to supplement her child's education, and thinks that spending a day at home doing academics would help?</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">Is she looking to spend time with her child? I guess I am wondering why she thinks ''homeschooling'' one day/week would give her what she is looking for. My definition of homeschooling is not merely supplementation; it is a full-time, enriching, educational program involving the whole family. As some poeple have responded, consistently taking a child out of school one day per week, for whatever reason, is a bad idea. The school and classroom is designed to build community, and constant absences would be detrimental in that regard. I don't believe the school would agree to do that anyway, because the school's funding depends on the child's presence in school. Not only that, but your child would be considered truant the days that he or she was absent under CA law, which states that ''[A]ll children between the ages of 6 and 18 must attend a public full-time day school unless otherwise exempted.''</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">It also states that ''Any child who will be six on or before December 2 of the school year is subject to the compulsory school requirements.'' If your child will turn 6 after the December 2 deadline, you don't even need to send your child to school. Kindergarten is not compulsory; 1st grade is. So you may have another year to decide what it is you're looking for. homeschooling parent My oldest daughter doesn't attend Albany schools, but we live in El Cerrito and she attends a small school in the Richmond hills -- Wildcat FreeSchool. All of the kids who attend there are part-time homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">It's a wonderful school and a wonderful system for the kids. Families get to choose how many and which days they attend or stay home. Our daughter goes four days per week. We, too, lack the inclination to homeschool full-time, but we also feel strongly about having our choices and about spending more time together as a family. No stress, no boredom, the best of all worlds. If you'd like to know more about it, you're welcome to email me. You could also attend an open house at the school; there's one last one coming up at the end of this month, March 25th from 2:00-4:00 p.m. Anne</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">We are moving from the UK to Berkeley in April. My son is 5 next dec and will just miss the cut-off for K. I'm actually relieved about that as I think an extra yr will do him good, socially and emotionally, and I'd also like to have more time with him. However he's a bright kid who seeks out intellectual stimulation and also loves music, dance, arts etc. He has been in a Waldorf program for the last year and a half and has loved it. I'm really battling with deciding between finding a (part time) pre-K program for him for sept or keeping him home and following something like the Oak Meadow homeschool program for a year. I'll be home with my toddler anyway and we could certainly use not spending $ on preschool. My biggest concern is that he really thrives in having independent time away from home and connecting strongly with other adults.</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">I'm not sure how I could provide this without school. I also am concerned about not finding friends for him of his own age or older who are not busy in school. And lastly, I'm wondering how he would adjust socially, and academically, to a BUSD K after being in Waldorf and at home. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

You are welcome to join our homeschool group, Homegrown Kids (www.homegrownkids.org). There are a lot of kids your child's age (both boys and girls) who participate in the group. Our group has parkdays every Monday at different parks throughout the East Bay. We also have weekly co-op day at various members' homes, field trips, potlucks, and other fun activities. A good way to meet other kids and families is to participate in afternoon sports, art classes, music classes, etc. Many children do these activities after school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">My children have friends who are private, public, and homeschooled.

Good luck and welcome to Berkeley!</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">Laurel Hi, I can totally relate to what you're feeling right now, my daughter will be in kindergarten for 2 years at East Bay Waldorf School. She did the pre-kindergarten program this year and absolutely LOVED it. Even though I go back and forth between homeschooling and Waldorf, she is the driving force that tells me that staying in Waldorf is the best, even though it will strap our finances in ways I don't care to think about. BUT, there are so many resources for homeschooling around here, this is the place I would do it if any. For my daughter, she gets so much from being exposed to Waldorf...the atmosphere, thoughtfulness of the curriculum, the nurturing of her individual character, and for me the community of parents and teachers is beyond what I think I could provide her, at least in these early years. Maybe I'll change my mind later, or maybe she will show me what she wants if/when the time comes to change. I would say if your son is used to Waldorf, and you're moving from far away, it would be good for him to experience something familiar, to sing a familiar song, or to partake in a familiar activity he enjoyed back home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">If the choice is between homeschooling and public, I think the best would be homeschooling. Good luck in your decision! Melissa You may be unpleasantly surprised when your son enters K in a year, especially if he has a great year homeschooling (which usually advances their academics quickly). I'm not sure what we're going to do with our 4, nearly 5 yo, for this next school year (his K year). He already has 3rd g math skills, reads relatively well, and has phenominal reasoning skills. I've found the Berkeley schools to be extremely ''relaxed'' in their academics, ie they teach skills at a later age than they need to. I'm deeply disappointed that this university town which could be &amp;amp; should be a model for other towns (in the Bay no less!)</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">is so slow to help kids reach their potential. Good luck. Mother of three, wishing &amp;amp; working for better I have an almost 4 year old and am just stepping into the murky waters of school options - public, private, montessori - and am curious about homeschooling in this area.

American and Latino) at two different public schools and chose to withdraw them for similar reasons. Mills is wonderfully diverse- truly amazing for a private school. There are many families of color (it actually feels like the majority) and good socio-economic diversity as well. It is really a gift to see our children thrive in a diverse community.It is also just a progressive, more student centered/project based environment, and the staff (leadership, teachers, and after school staff) are gifted educators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">The curriculum is really designed to build on student interests and based on an assessment of individual strengths and needs. Unlike many public schools, Mills is a school where parents really do have a voice- if there is an issue, there is really an open door policy. The school is always looking for opportunities to be responsive. The number is 430-2053. American families are enrolled in the Hickman Charter School. That might be a way to link up with other families. I was appalled to see that even the Montclair Elementary schools have class sizes of ~30 kindergarteners.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">It's an amazing school, and has just out-performed ALL the Lafayette and Piedmont schools on the State API scores (if you care about that sort of thing). I really like all of the fabulous enrichment the kids gets in class, in addition to the strong academics and strong sense of community. Also, smaller class size doesn't always translate to a better education... Happy Montclair Parent HI I homeschooled at Hickman Charter School - I liked having the homebase office to visit, the staff it upbeat and energetic,like them alot. They offer more socialization for mom and child with classes and fieldtrips. My daughter had a blast doing carpentry and sewing classes ( better for older kids) the other homeschool programs are not as social and you have to find groups to affiliate with.

Susan Both of my children have gone K-8 with Hickman Charter School. The resource center is in Oakland, but it is not actually through the Oakland schools. The first time I went to visit, I was able to ask many questions and talk with teachers, and meet other parents, and it was a great fit for my child instead of traditional K. There are many resources in the area for homeschooling. You can find lots of kids to play with, so the common concern about being lonely is not real. We are currently in an incredible Montessori program for kindergarden (program is pre-school to 6 years) and are considering homeschooling in addition to our public and private school options.</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">I am planning to attend some Homegrown Kids park-days and am devouring resources on-line but am curious to hear from experienced homeschoolers in the BPN community. A public school homeschooling option is with BUSD's Berkeley Independent Study's (BIS) Home School Program. In the K-8 Home School program, parents/guardians accompany students to weekly 90-minute meetings with teachers. Assignments adhere to state curriculum standards while accommodating students' interests and abilities. BIS provides instructional materials, and tutoring is available. Parents/guardians act as home teachers for all of the K-8 lessons. They need to be available to supervise their child's studies at home for 20-25 hours per week.</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">For some students, this program is an excellent alternative to the regular classroom and home teachers can engage in a collaborative approach to learning for their children.

You are right that homeschooling is different for every family. Homeschooling exists on a continuum from ''School at Home'' where parent and child sit down for several hours a day with a premade curriculum to Unschooling where parents provide an enriched environment and plenty of trips and allow the children to pursue their own interests at their own pace. In my experience most people exist somewhere in the middle of this range, using a mixture of curricula, classes, co-ops, clubs, groups, field trips and free time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="39">In our family we have used online math 3 days/week for several months and then not used it for a while. We have a math tutor who does math challenges and math circle type problems once per week. We used Saxon math for a few months and Harcourt math for a few months several years ago. We had a Latin club for half a year that turned into a co-op that lasted a year and now Latin continues as a class for the small group of kids who are still interested. We have gone in and out of co-ops over our 7 years of homeschooling. We try to travel for 2-8 weeks every year and we don't try to do any ''school'' work during our travel. http://trackersbay.com/youth/preschool/tots.php</paragraph><paragraph parID="40">The kids all have music lessons one day/week and some of them ice skate and have Lawrence Hall of Science classes.

We occasionally to math worksheets, and are always reading, but most learning happens throughout the day. We joined Ocean Grove Charter which provides us with state funds for some expenses.</paragraph><paragraph parID="41">We have monthly meetings with a teacher to confirm DD is learning; when she's older we'll be required to do state testing (or opt out same as public schoolers). We do know other HS families with more structure to their day - there are many ways to build YOUR school. Some kids thrive on set plans, others learn readily in a more freeform fashion. What other activities do you do with your kid(s) beyond the fundamentals? The OUSD website states that parents and children must meet with a teacher several times a week, and I'm wondering how that works in practice. I am considering homeschooling because I am very disappointed in our ''excellent'' public elementary school and therefore discouraged about OUSD schools in general. Oakland residents can use hickman charter which offers classes or connecting waters charter which offers more money for materials and classes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">The only requirement is that you take attendance. I use a google calendar and once a year I mark my three pupils present every weekday for the preceding year. Your public school district should provide all the resources you will need, including a supervising credentialed teacher that you and your child will check in with a couple of times a month. The authors - a home-schooling mom and her adult daughter - provide a very detailed outline to an academically rigorous home schooling curriculum. I likely won't homeschool - but I found this book very helpful in understanding what a good academic program should look like, and may well use it to supplement my kid's school education at home.

A homeschooler's dirty little secret is that we can go to parks without sharing it with a mob of kids. Pros of homeschooling: - You can tailor the education to your child's needs - It takes less time to get through a day's lessons - Kids have more time to pursue other interests or just play - No rush in the morning, no homework at night - You set your own schedule, which includes the ability to travel mid-week and off-season - No lost time driving, volunteering, or fundraising - I enjoy the satisfaction that comes with helping my kids grow Cons of homeschooling: - You may not have as much personal time - Substantial loss of my income - Sometimes it's hard to get errands done with kids in tow If the kids stay at home for so many years, won't it make it harder for them to separate when they need to? What a glorious suprise to find that it is easy, joyful, rewarding, successful, fun, and the best education I could offer my kids. We were really concerned that his reading fluency combined with his temperament would result in his disrupting the class, over discipline by the teacher, and resulting low self esteem. Last year was our first year homeschooling and this year our 5 year old is staying home with us as well (instead of going to kindergarten).</paragraph><paragraph parID="45">We discovered over the past year that homeschooling has brought us closer as a family. It is really hard to articulate how wonderful homeschooling has been for our family. It used to be that I could explain our reasons from a typically academic standpoint; now it's becoming more emotionally charged and hard to pin down. While I can certainly see some advantages to homeschooling (protecting kids from bad influences, the options of many educational fieldtrips, more individual attention), and the testimonials given by homeschoolers here were interesting &amp;amp; cogent, there are some real drawbacks that should be considered. Exposure to many other adults - even a few not- so-great ones - broadens kids' understanding of personalities and cultures immeasurably, and teaches trust of the outside world, confidence in negotiating it, flexibility and resiliency. Yes, the world is a scary place, but there ARE excellent schools, and superb teachers out there, who will only enhance your child's understanding of life and relationships and the world. So, some ideas on how to make sure homeschoolers avoid these problems - and I know many smart, community-building homeschoolers already do these type of things: develop a big network of fellow-homeschoolers, and coordinate large-group classes or playdates.</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">My son homeschooled for four years and has just returned to school for 8th grade. We've had a very good experience, both with our homeschooling years, and with the transition back into school, but homeschooling is not for everyone. I would urge strongly that anyone making a decision about it speak directly to people who have done it. Homeschooling is the same thing as public school, but the parent is the teacher in all subject and there is much less peer interaction. Unschooling is a branch of homeschooling. Homeschoolers use different methods. Some are traditional and use regular textbooks or take community college classes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">Unschooling is less traditional, usually interest-driven by the children, who tend to immerse themselves in a topic and explore it thoroughly. I have known many unschoolers who are bright, creative, talented, and socially adept. Homeschooling, any kind, is a wonderful choice. As a parent exploring learning options for my toddlers, I have read extensively about homeschooling and have been intrigued by unschooling. For a thorough explanation of unschooling, I highly recommend Joyce Fetteroll's website at http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/. Whether or not you choose to unschool or even homeschool, the ideas of unschooling can be useful for healthy and happy relationships between parents and children. We tried two years of public school for our oldest, and all my fears came true.</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">So, finally I have convinced my husband to give homeschooling a try. I know about a homeschooling group here in Alameda, but what about field trips, clubs, etc. for girls? My mom recently homeschooled 2 of her kids (my younger siblings) for a couple of years with the assistance of the Berkeley homeschooling group (a great group of teachers and parents). The kids totally resent it now. They are upset that they were kept out of ''regular school''. Also it was not the best thing for my their relationship. Also, it can be very difficult for some kids to go from homeschooling back into the normal school environment so make sure that it's really the best option for you, your family, and most importantly your daughter.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">My father was a school superintendent and worked with local homeschoolers to 'fill in the gaps' in the parents' curriculums (lab sciences, advanced mathematics, team sports, band/orchestra, theater) Granted, this was earlier in the homeschool 'movement.' Poke around your public schools. They may not work overall for you and your family, but you may find aspects complement your efforts. Many in the public school system may be hostile or think that you are nuts, but there are plenty who will respect and support your efforts. Finally, before you make the switch, you need to ask yourself if the all of your fears were realized, because you were looking for them to be realized (are you blowing stuff out of proportion...) or are the problems with the public schools really that big. Maybe your husband isn't jumping on your bandwagon because he thinks that you are making a mountain out of a molehill. Just a thought... -anon</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">You have to be careful about the advice you recieve on this topic. I just decided to homeschool my children, and I have found that many people who are against it tend to be people who don't know all the facts and/or don't have any personal experience with it. Since I don't know your personal situation, I can't tell you if it's a good decision. I have decided it will be best for my family, and many others have too. My best advice to you is to seek support from a nearby homeschool-support group. You can probably find one using google. They can offer so much information, advice, homeschool oppurtunities, and fellowship.</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">You'd probably meet veteran homeschoolers in your area who've been through very similar situations as you have. Good luck-and remember, the right path is not always the easy path. They currently go to a Catholic school, and we are realizing that their current path is not at all what we envision for them. It is really important to us that we raise girls who are not only excellent students (they are), but strong and aware that the world extends beyond Limited Too and Webkinz! Our oldest is in 5th grade,a great kid but a little naive socially, and mucking through the mire of nasty girls who tear each other apart at any opportunity. What we want is to explore home-schooling her, meeting up with other home schooled kids, and supplementing what she is learning with travel to other, less fortunate, but amazing places on our planet. At the same time, we would like to have her enter high school more than well prepared for the academics ahead, as her choice of college is totally wide open.</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">Is there any like-minded group in the Berkeley/Oakland/Lamorinda/Concord area that we can collaborate with? It is so important to us that our girls learn to be strong women who are part of the SOLUTION, not tearing other women apart in this crazy, keep-up-with-the-Joneses society. Why do we do this to each other???!!! Your input is greatly appreciated! I am part of the wonderful homeschooling community in East Bay, and there are a lot of resources and options available for those interested in this educational path-- check out Homegrownkids.org online for a lot of information and links to other websites. My daughter (who will be 11 in September) and I are also looking for homeschooling groups, and we would love to talk with you. She is completing 5th grade this year in public school (Madera) in El Cerrito.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">We are going to homeschool in the Fall. Her younger sister will attend public school (1st grade), but will participate in some of our special projects and travel and outings, as well. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience or advice about home- schooling just one day a week. I have a son in Kindergarten who is pretty bored. We could skip him, he has a Fall birthday and is on the older end of the age spectrum, but I think that might be more stressful for him than the boredom. Neither my husband nor I have the temperament or inclination to homeschool full-time, but a friend of ours has been homeschooling her daughter one day a week in Southern California which sounds intriguing. First,and most importantly, I fervently believe parents should be able to determine how best to educate their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">We, (not the government) will answer to God for the choices that we make regarding our kids, and therefore we should be free to make the one that best fits our family, convictions, and beliefs. There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these options, and it's up to you to decide where your family fits. In this article I am not looking to argue for one over the other, or to make anyone uncomfortable, but to address my concerns regarding the confusion between homeschooling and Charter Schools. It is one way to reclaim lost revenue and undermine the homeschooling system that has developed over the past 20 years, and to regulate and control what is taught in our homes. In my case I wasn't just contacted by Charter Schools that wanted me to enroll my sons, but I've also been contacted by schools that wanted me to combine Grace Prep with them, or who wanted me to teach there. Obviously, there are many financial incentives that would make that very appealing...and believe me, we could have used the money...but we chose to remain independent for a variety of reasons. At a cursory glance it appears that the government has recognized the advantages of homeschooling and has jumped on the bandwagon by establishing independent study programs and charter schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">I am not questioning the value of Charter, Online Schools, or other public school options that allow students to do their work at home, I am just asking that they not be called homeschools Charter Schools versus Homeschooling The survival of the homeschooling movement, from a legal perspective, may come from making a clear distinction between homeschooling and Charter Schools. Choosing to use a Charter is a viable alternative, it is not homeschooling. Charter Schools are public schools, they are funded by the government with tax dollars. When you join a Charter school you are part of the public school system. While the student in a Charter may be doing the bulk of his/her work at home, he is a public school student.</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">School authorities have the final say and oversight. Homeschooling, as I'm defining it, means that you and your children pick the resources and curriculum that you will use. Parents are in charge and have authority and the ability to change the curriculum and schedule at any time, and they pay for their own materials. Homeschools are free and separate from the state system. Homeschoolers have freedom to integrate their Christian worldview into their teaching and to use curriculum that expresses a Christian viewpoint. Traditionally, homeschooling has been defended in the courts under the First Amendment, that it is part of our freedom of religion to educate our children in accordance with our religious convictions. (Secular homeschooling has it's place, but it is harder to defend from a legal perspective.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">Once a third party starts paying the bills, it's their schooling, not homeschooling. They now have the right and the responsibility to regulate, restrict, and monitor what happens in the homes of those who are enrolled. Now, many of these state-funded educational options are billing themselves as 'homeschooling'. The very nature, language and essence of homeschooling are being challenged and even co-opted by a vast array of emerging educational programs which may be based in the home, but are funded by government tax dollars, bringing inevitable government controls....There is the profound possibility that homeschooling is not only on the brink of losing its distinctiveness, but also is in grave danger of losing its independence. We can see this happening with school board members who refer to these programs as 'bringing home schooling under the state's umbrella'. Many leaders within the homeschool movement that have worked hard to obtain and maintain our freedoms have warned of the danger. As Charter schools become the norm, homeschoolers who resist state regulation will be considered a fringe group.</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">Since public schools have provided the 'homeschool' option many will not see the need to preserve the rights of parents to homeschool independently. That means it is unethical and possibly illegal for any religious instruction to occur during the process of teaching an academic subject, even in the home. However, Charters have gotten into trouble in the past few years for not abiding by these rules, and for misusing funds (allowing parents to purchase Christian curriculum with school monies.) If the line between homeschool and Charters has become blurred, it will be difficult to fight those regulating efforts for those of us who wish to remain independent. It is about the right of the parent to be free to make decisions without the interference, oversight or regulation of the government. Both in court, and in studies, parents have proved they are competent to teach their own children and do not require the oversight of credentialed teachers or government agencies. By offering financial incentives through Charter schools, the government has made significant inroads into the homeschooling community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">Over the past few generations the boundaries and responsibilities of our public schools has expanded. I have found that the marketing for charter schools (beyond the financial incentives) often uses fear to convince insecure parents that the government can provide a 'safe' way to homeschool. Some of the most creative and successful options out there have been created by homeschooling families looking for a better way. I want them to be able to incorporate a Christian worldview into their teaching, I want them to be free from the tyranny of standardized testing, I want them to be able to make free choices without government interference...and I think that if the current trend continues the homeschooling ground we have gained over the past decades will quickly be eroded. My daughter is enrolled in a "homeschool" charter school, and although according to the state she is a public school student, we also fall fairly neatly into your definition of homeschoolers. Our county is very unfriendly toward homeschooling families and several Charters by us have gotten into serious trouble for doing just what you have described. Two Articles on Public versus Home Schools</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">Pastor Stein sees the Public Schools artifically inflating their graduation rates by having deadbeat parents "say" they will homeschool their kids. His critique of what Stein says is spot on, though. These kids were already drop-out material. Public schools are some of the most profoundly un-Christian environments around. They teach things that directly contradict the Bible. They teach kids that it's ok to have sex outside of marriage. They teach that it's ok to lust after the same sex.</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">They teach that your kids should keep their faith private and out of public life. They teach history in a way that ignores, and/or lies about, and/or minimizes Christianities influence. I've heard parents say that they want their kids to be lights in the school for Christ. It should be Christian schools first, then private schools, then any other options, then public schools. The idea of the government regulating home-schooling is laughable and defeats the whole point of home-schooling: to get away from government management of the system! If there is no evidence of actual home-schooling or there is evidence of schools lying about why kids dropped out, go after that issue, but do not regulate the whole system. As a long term home-school kid, with 3 home-schooled siblings, parents who sued the state of Texas (Leaper vs. AISD) and now a graduate of a top 40 law school, I am proof that home-schooling generally works.</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">Cost of Homeschooling VS Public School When you compare the cost of homeschooling vs public school expenses per year, you may be very shocked at the difference. well over $10,000! Yes, the government is currently shelling out an average of well over $10,000 for every single child in the public school system . That is per year, not per their entire educational career. Homeschooling VS Public Schooling Expenses for Parents Once you learn that number, you may be quite shocked to hear that many homeschooling families spend less than $1,000 a year to educate ALL of their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">Those only homeschooling a couple children can often do it for just $500 a year, all children included. Then you add in the costs for field trips, school lunches, and paid sports, a public school parent has actually spent more than the average homeschooling parent does on all expenses combined! Cost of Homeschooling vs Public School Costs for the School System It comes down to the nature of homeschooling versus the nature of public schools. Parents are not being paid to teach their children. Public schools have to bring teachers in for money, so it is more of a business transaction. The homeschooling parent is willing to do the teaching for no financial compensation and they do not demand fancy equipment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">For instance, curriculum and textbooks can be passed down from one child to the next or sold to another family at a discounted price. Homeschooling families have proven that with their test scores that outshine students from public schools. If your children go to public school, do you have any idea how much the government is paying to put them through school each year? This may be shocking, so you might want to take a seat before you read this number: Many public and private schools send home a list of supplies and requirements for parent to purchase in the summer each year that actually exceeds this cost! A 2011 survey by the National Retail Federation found out that an "average the American family will spend $606.40 on clothes, shoes, supplies and electronics" for back to school! Considering that the public schools already have parents helping with the costs of supplies, why are these overall costs so different?</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">Here are the basic facts that make homeschooling a more affordable option: They do it out of love and seeing their children grow up successfully is their paycheck at the end of the day. Parents do not have to purchase or rent out facilities to teach their children in. They teach where they live. Public schools have to pay for large buildings, buses, and tons of equipment. Homeschooling parents tend to buy what is needed and nothing more. Schools have a lot of waste in their budgets.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">The real reason public schooling is so expensive really comes down to this final point. Money is often wasted on needless equipment, large principal salaries and large teacher pensions. They put on the hat of Principal and teacher without demanding that huge salary in exchange. Managing the Cost of Homeschooling Some basic things that you will need for homeschooling include: Textbooks and curriculum for each child, each year. A computer with Internet access.</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">Basic school supplies such as crafting tools, paper and pencils. Tables and chairs with space for completing the teaching sessions and work. Field trips as needed. Another thing that brings the cost down for homeschooling is the willingness for parents to share and recycle. The library can be used for Internet access if needed. Field trips can often be carried out for free or very low financial investment. It does not have to cost more than $1,000 a year to educate a child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">Parents that are willing to purchase secondhand, network with other homeschooling families, and cut expenses wherever possible, will find homeschooling to be a very affordable option. There may be more extra expenses as a child gets into the high school years and needs more resources from outside the home, but the total yearly expenses should still be very close to $1,000. In many cases, it will remain under that even during the high school years. More Money Does Not Equal More Success in Education He who has the fattest pockets does not always produce the most talented, most successful, talented child! Class size The benefits of smaller classes are now widely acknowledged. Private Schools At present, private school students are faring much better academically than are their public school counterparts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">Private schools have considerable freedom from government interference, have the freedom to focus on teaching the core academic subjects, and select excellent curricular materials without being subjected to pressure from political advocacy groups. Private schools still retain, however, the limitations that are intrinsic to the classroom method of instruction . At a public school (and sometimes a private school), a child does not need to become a troublemaker to find trouble - too often it comes to the child. All it takes is for a bully to choose that child for their target or for the child to be in the vicinity of a violent person or group at the wrong time. While this obviously is not a problem at all public schools, homeschooling avoids this problem pretty much entirely. Nor do school districts always cooperate with parents who wish to transfer their child to another, better, teacher's class or to another, better, school campus. Homeschooling avoids the risks of poor quality schools and teachers, and with unhelpful school administrators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">Special Needs Children Not all public schools do consistently well in handling children with special needs. Thus, a child with a learning problem that requires some sort of special type of instruction or learning environment may not find the public school amenable or even able to satisfy that need. Likewise, the parents of a child who is gifted may find the public school unable (sometimes unwilling) to provide advanced instruction to help the child develop their giftedness. While homeschooling a child with special needs presents challenges to the parents, homeschooling enables the ones who know the child best and care the most for the child, the parents, to use their knowledge and love for their child in directly educating their child. Homeschooling is one alternative parents should consider when faced with a non-resolvable, harmful conflict. Flexible homeschool curriculum and full service homeschooling help and support is available at Bridgeway Homeschool Academy. The public school has very limited ability (and sometimes little will) to protect bullied students or guide students away from bad influences , and have a difficult time enforcing discipline.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">What is easily forgotten, however, is that a disruptive child or two can bring so much turmoil to a classroom that even an excellent teacher cannot teach, and that students who are eager to learn cannot learn as they desire. Parents need to know how to recognize whether a problem is resolvable, or whether it will go on being detrimental to their child's education and growing up process. When the latter is the case, parents urgently need to look around for alternatives to what isn't working for their child. A recent study reported that adults who were homeschooled are more involved in their communities (71 percent participate in community service versus 37 percent of traditional public school graduates) and more vote in elections than public school grads (76 percent versus 29 percent). Not only are they active in the community, they are 35 percent more likely to attend college than their traditional-school counterparts. Refugee homeschoolers are parents who never thought they'd homeschool, but took the plunge because, as one mom put it, "attending traditional school was actively hurting my child." &amp;gt; Personalized, natural learning A homeschooled child can move from one task to another when the time is right, not when the bell rings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">Homeschooling allows a child to begin where he or she is - at, above or below grade level - and master each skill before moving on. &amp;gt; Family values can be taught Many parents want to be able to read Bible-based stories during reading time or discuss historical events through the lens of their faith. Homeschooling allows this. Homeschooled children get the opportunity to interact with all ages of people, often making them more comfortable in diverse social situations than their "regular-schooled" peers. Homeschool 101 A primer for your family Are you considering homeschooling your child?</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">If so, you're not alone. The number of families in the U.S. who homeschool their children has increased 34 percent since 2000. It is the fastest-rising trend in education, though homeschooling is no longer considered a fad. In fact, many of the major thinkers of the 20th century were homeschooled, including Albert Einstein, Plato, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. Today's homeschool graduates are doing well. Who homeschools? Homeschooling is no longer only for the wealthy elite or the devoutly religious.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">Homeschooling families have become very diverse with one key commonality: a desire to provide the best education possible for their children. There are many reasons that families choose to homeschool, but these reasons generally fall under two distinct categories: native homeschoolers and refugee homeschoolers. Native homeschoolers are parents who either have dreamed of homeschooling since the day they found out that they were expecting or those who had a personal epiphany at some point while raising their children. These parents often want their children to learn in a more comfortable, natural environment. Others want to be able to tailor the curriculum to their child and avoid time wasters like busywork. These children may have medical conditions, might have been bullied or may have attention issues. Why homeschool?</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">&amp;gt; A flexible schedule Do you want to travel with your child? Does your child's chronic illness make regular attendance at school difficult? Maybe you need more time for your child's outside interests (acting, modeling, motocross, etc.). In today's fast-paced world, many children are not getting adequate rest. Since one-on-one tutoring is so time efficient, your child has more time for sleep, recreation and family. Since the parent knows the child so well, homeschooled families can modify the curriculum to meet the unique needs of their child. &amp;gt; Master, then move on!</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">What happens in many traditional classrooms if your child has mastered his grade's content standards in the middle of the year? Often, he is given more of the same work to do (but now it's called "enrichment!") It's very hard for traditional schools to accelerate a child who is ready, just as it's hard for these schools to make progress with children who are significantly behind. In addition, home education can protect children from a fast-paced media culture in which they are often forced to grow up too quickly. What about socialization? This is probably the most common question homeschooling parents get. Most homeschool parents I know have kids who are involved in league or travel sports, drama, youth groups, Scouts, 4H and many other social endeavors.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">Many homeschoolers have packed schedules every day from 3 to 8 p.m. in extra- curricular activities. Also, homeschooling families are wonderful networkers. Almost every community has an organized homeschool group with park days, community events, activities and even co-op classes. Homeschooling options &amp;gt; District Independent Study Program (ISP) Most school districts offer limited numbers of spaces for what they term "independent study" students. These district programs offer the same curriculum as the local school, which can be helpful if you think you might only homeschool for a semester or two. Sometimes, district programs provide classes and events for their homeschooled students.</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">&amp;gt; Charter Schools Charter schools are free, state-funded public schools that are allowed to operate with more flexibility than traditional public schools. There are a number of "personalized learning" charter schools in California that specialize in supporting homeschoolers. These schools usually offer learning center classes, field trips and enrichment course options throughout the community, along with a wider selection of curricula than most district ISPs. &amp;gt; Private Independent Study Program (ISP) Many private schools offer secular or sectarian-based curricula with or without the support of a qualified teacher. These schools charge tuition, but are often much less expensive than traditional private schools. &amp;gt; Independent Homeschool Any family can homeschool independently by filing a "Private School Affidavit" form with the California Department of Education . This option provides the most freedom but no support.</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">IS HOMESCHOOLING RIGHT FOR YOU ? Homeschooling is not a decision that should be made lightly. It takes a tremendous commitment from the parent opting to take on the role of teacher. Here are questions to help you make this important decision: &amp;gt; Do you have sufficient time? Obviously, you must be home for a large part of the day and able to devote several hours to instruction, monitoring and assisting your child with his or her studies. &amp;gt; Do you have the necessary knowledge?</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">While it's easier to teach lower-level students, homeschooling can challenge a parent who is not proficient in a particular field of study. Consider enlisting a tutor for help. &amp;gt; Do you have enough patience? You must also have the temperament for teaching. Patience and understanding are key requirements. Readers Feedback: I really like this article!</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">I plan on homeschooling my children, and this is such an encouragement for me. I have observed that most homeschoolers are more confident than most of their peers. Now, the homeschooling philosophy is quite different from traditional schooling, it's more about learning life skills and to go into something that you're interested in, and not merely take up say, hard Science subjects just for the mere goal of taking it. And that homeschooling is a an alternative to traditional schooling. It is critical that one enroll in a DepEd Accredited program because this allows for lateral entry into traditional schooling at any point should the parents decide to put the child back in a traditional school, i.e. the parents may want to just finish primary / elementary levels then put the child back in a traditional school come highschool. Academic performance wise, I recall a presentation about the achievement of our homeschool students over traditionally schooled students. Our homeshoolers were about 1-2 years ahead overall in academic performance over their peers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">Bullying is certainly a big factor, especially since the school admin and teachers might not be able to ensure the safety of every child that goes through the school doors. Please read more about the socialization process...because that is not a process that exclusively happens between peers. It is critical that the homeschool program is DepEd accredited because that will enable one to do lateral entry...meaning, you can choose to put the child back in a traditional highschool if the parents desire so. One of the proponents of this unschooling philosophy is John Holt. Homeschhool parents can and do have learning cooperatives ( http://homeschool.lifetips.com/cat/64324/homeschool-co-op/index.html ) where they pool skills and resources, including group teaching where one parent can teach those Science subjects you mentioned. Perhaps if the quality of education was better, there maybe less homeschoolers, but that is merely a guess. Homeschoolers too can and do opt to have learning cooperatives.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">This is where they can pool resources to create say a DIY laboratory with one parent who is a Science major to teach the class. There are also homeschool providers that offer additional services for parents who feel they can't teach rigorous subjects. In addition, the curriculum is accredited by a certified U.S. curriculum program, thus, our program is doubly certified by both DepEd and a U.S. accreditation system. It's true that homeschooling in general includes more contact hours at home, but it doesn't mean that learning is solely done at home. The whole world can literally become the student's educational oyster. Thus, you are not merely confined to teaching your child from a book (although standard instructional materials will most likely be assigned by most homeschooling providers). In fact, you can teach more, over and above available instructional materials, topics, and formats.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">Best of all, you can delve into topics your child is interested in as well. For example, to promote Science learning, aside from teaching the child what's in the book, you can bring him/her to the Mind Museum, NIDO's Science Center, Museo Pambata, a planetarium, or a microbiology lab. In a microbio lab, a child can don a lab gown, wear protective plastic for his/her shoes, peer under a microscope, and discuss with lab researchers and technicians. Then again, home-schooling will only work for families that are ready for the all the challenges that come with it. everything that one can learn in homeschooling is available in regular mainstream. I believe that since homeschoolers have more opportunities to interact with real life experiences, with more people of different kinds, they can have an edge over conventionally taught students. Teacher to student ratio - traditional school anywhere from 20-100 students to 1 teacher versus 1 child: 1-2 homeschool parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">No need for security guards in a homeschooling system. Socialization with people of all ages (note: parents can easily opt to always bring out their children everyday and not have them cooped up at home). Homeschool days can include week ends and holidays. One will not be affected by class suspensions due to bad weather. Safe food - cafeteria food can be the cause of food poisoning. Vacations are also opportunities for learning. You can study as many books as you like, added with the instructional materials provided by the homeschool provider.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">No more need for things like raising one's hands just to go the bathroom. Homeschool parents need not worry if their child learned something in school. The latest "fads" which may not be appropriate for your child does not reach a homeschooled child, including gangs, drugs, bullying, religious indoctrination, cults, etc. There is more emphasis on life skills, accounting, keeping chores, cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, over and above merely academic stuff. Individualized instruction - There's always time to go into the interests and competencies of the child. No worries about epidemics like the recent AH1N1 which forced many schools to close for long periods. Education is more fun for the children - you can go anywhere to learn; a park, a museum, an indie gig, a science center, a local laboratory, city hall, govt buildings, historical sites, cultural festivals and events (music, dance, visual arts), etc. etc.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">In fact, a big part of homeschooling is experience-based (experiential) learning outside the usual four corners of traditional classrooms. Another question that crops up is whether homeschooling is illegal. In some countries it is, but luckily for the Philippines, it isn't. Again, homeschooling would fall under a non-formal kind of education (granted a choice of only formal or non-formal education). Formal education comprised "regular school and university education"; non-formal education (NFE) comprised "out-of-school and continuing education, on the job training, etc."; and informal education comprised "family and socially directed learning". Another common concern is the socialization process. Despite that definition, there seems to be this thinking that children learn more from other children close to their ages (as exemplified by schools artificially grouping children into grade levels) than when children are exposed to other children and people of different ages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">What can commonly happen in schools is that traditionally schooled children who spend most of their waking moments in school will most likely look to their peers as role models. Homeschooled children, on the other hand, have more contact with their parents and maybe other older children (siblings, cousins, neighbors) and just different kinds of people, affording them more opportunities to meet with and observe social norms from older children and adults than if they were relegated to the classroom. While strong advocates for FE and die hard supporters of NFE and IE have cited conflicting results about the socialization of homeschoolers vs tradional students, a more recent paper by Koehler, Langness, Pietig, Stoffel, and Wyttenbach ( http://murphylibrary.uwlax.edu/digital/jur/2002/koehler-langness-pietig-stoffel-wyttenbach.pdf  ), seems indicative of the potential promise of better socialization skills of homeschoolers over traditional students. The Social Skills Rating System (SSRS), a reliable and valid assessment tool of social skills, contains fifty-five questions that probe into social skill subcategories of cooperation, assertion, responsibility, and self-control. The SSRS was administered to a total sample of 23 children (7 homeschooled versus 16 traditionally schooled children). Results "indicated that the homeschooled population demonstrated above average overall social skills with a mean score of 63.143. The traditionally schooled children demonstrated average social skills with a mean score of 55.125" (Koehler et.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">al: p 472). In addition, using the t-test for independent means (a test to show if there is significant quantitative differences between two discrete groups), it was reported that "a statistical difference was found when comparing the means of the two groups in relation to their overall scores at the .01 level, with the homeschooled children scoring higher. With regards to the subcategories, the results were mixed. In the area of responsibility, a statistical significance was found at the .01 level, indicating that the homeschooled population scored significantly higher than the publicly schooled population. No statistically significant differences were found in relation to other subcategories." Further, Koehler and company also cited earlier studies which also supported their findings, including that of Stough (1992) who said that, "it would appear that few homeschooled children are socially deprived, and that there may be sufficient evidence to indicate that some homeschooled children have a higher self concept than conventionally schooled children " (as cited in Aiex, 1994). They also cited the work of Smedley, (1992) who found that, "home educated children are more mature and socialized than those sent to school."</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Granted that the sample size is low, and thus, future studies must include a bigger sample size as well as similar local studies. As a parting note, homeschooling has afforded me several other benefits, not the least of which include more family bonding, less cost (no uniform or daily transportation costs), less worry about my son fitting in school, bullying, or even infection from recent epidemics (like the last AH1N1 scare). At worst, sectarian schools will constrain and indoctrinate children with unconstitutional school rules and guidelines and superstitious mumbo jumbo. With homeschooling, my son and I can be out having nature walks and talks, identifying plants, trees, and insects. while homeschooling has its advantages, it's up to the parents to weigh these and the things that their kid will surely miss. and if family up to the second degree is "social" enough, i say it's the child who will manifest this later. Philippine traditional schooling versus homeschooling - the differences are a lot more apparent when they are compared:</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">I find it hard to imagine how homeschooling can cut it when the child lives in a scholastically competitive society like Hong Kong or Singapore. Also, some parents may not be equipped to teach rigorous subjects like Physics, Chemistry or Math. If the quality of education was better as a whole, then probably, there would be less homeschoolers in the first place. According to some stats provided by our homeschooling provider (which I cannot mention here), generally, the homeschoolers in our program are about 1-2 years ahead of their peer groups. This category is for questions relating to the methods, theories, or general needs of educating your child from home. For questions on specific school subjects, please see the related category: School Subjects. Public schools, in general, are failing our children academically, morally, and philosophically.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">Given the documented success of home schoolers versus their public and private schooled peers, no one can legitimately claim academic deficiencies as a basis for opposing home schooling. The question is too simple. What kind of socialization is preferable? As a wise person once told me, proper socialization comes from modeling adults, not other children. The public school environment is an artificial one where our children only interact with, save their teacher, other kids their age. This amendment will help protect your parental rights whether you send your children to public school or private school or if you homeschool. The Imperfect Homeschooler informs us that home schooling allows us to raise children who are not peer-dependent and who thus do not become peer-dependent adults, using the amusing story of parents concerned about one-upping each other for their kids' birthday parties.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">In Home Schooling , Klicka makes the point that we cannot expect our children to think and act like Christians if they spend their whole day, five days a week, in an environment that teaches them to think and act like a secular humanist. Klicka notes the Biblical principles supporting home schooling, the benefits of home schooling, and the large number of influential Americans who were home schooled. Home Schooling goes on to recite the victories won against those with an interest in a public school monopoly. No other setting in society is like that. We tell someone that we're homeschooling our children and that person says, "But what about socialization? Faced with irrefutable evidence that homeschoolers do better academically, the educators will say, "But school is not just about academics. Children learn socialization--how to get along with others."</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">Why I Plan to Train My Children At Home Category: Homeschooling Christ-centered home education is not merely one educational alternative. As for me, I have seen enough of public and private schools to know that I do not want my children in those environments. The bait of free materials or the perception of getting help from "real teachers" seems inviting, but having public school employees overseeing your homeschool dramatically alters the spiritual dynamic of the home. More than that, they discovered that biblical homeschooling changed everyone in the family, bringing them through God's refining fire and helping strengthen their relationship with Jesus, and with each other. Not only that, but the behemoth of public education was taking a financial hit whenever a child was withdrawn from public school or never entered in the first place. Strategies to stop homeschooling failed, and homeschooling was proven to be legal in all fifty states. We urge bible-believing Christians to refrain from becoming yoked with government homeschool programs for many reasons, and to instead discover the blessings of a non-government biblical home education:</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">There is no free lunch -- when you take public school money for homeschooling, you are agreeing to allow the state be the head of your children's education. In private homeschooling done biblically, the buck stops with the dad (or mom if there is no dad in that family). If the dad decides he doesn't want his kids taking a certain standardized test, does he have the ultimate authority? If he picks out the textbooks and decides they are to all be Biblical, is he able to do this? If he decides he wants a child of his to skip a certain subject this year to concentrate on another, does he have the power to make that call? Only in private biblical homeschooling does the father have this authority. Government homeschooling puts the mother under the counsel of humanists.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">In contrast, a family that chooses private Christian homeschooling can tell their neighbors they are a blessing to taxpayers -- and they do not have to feel guilty about contributing to the delinquency of America. Since government homeschooling vouchers are only supposed to go for non-sectarian materials, the homeschool marketplace is experiencing pressure for more secular texts, even from Christian households that otherwise would purchase decidedly Christian materials. And a look at the writings of children in those days shows they were more educated than modern children who have bountiful fancy equipment and curriculum. With government homeschooling, you become unequally yoked with the unsaved. Not just in the task of educating your children by being guided by a humanist system, but in the other associations you and your children make. There are meetings and activities sponsored by the government homeschooling programs. These expose your family to ungodly peers -- both for Mom, and for the children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">Is this about homeschooling or is homeschooling a means to an end (in our case, raising up a child in the Lord Jesus?) But unbelievers are homeschooling for very different reasons -- to create what the public school is creating -- a worldly child. When you are meeting with a public school teacher or have unsaved homeschooling friends, it makes you less likely to follow your Christian convictions. Also, Christians who join government homeschooling usually stop supporting the Christian homeschooling movement and Christian homeschooling conventions. If a public school employee picks out and pays for your curriculum, and they have their own social activities -- why associate with other Christians at conventions and support groups? If you enroll in government homeschooling, you are agreeing to follow the agenda of a system that does not recognize Jesus as Lord. In private biblical homeschooling, you follow God's standards.</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">Government homeschooling weakens our parental rights by drastically reducing the number of homeschoolers willing to put up a fight politically. Once you accept government money, you give up your rights -- dependents have no motivation to fight the system that feeds them. You have agreed to homeschooling on their terms. Anti-homeschooling liberals have made it plain they will want all homeschoolers under their authority. Discover the blessings of a non-government controlled, private biblical home education. Christians in government homeschooling have other activities they must attend, and when they do attend private biblical homeschooling groups, there often is tension. In a homeschool support group, Mom tends to talk about her head, her goals, the activities they do and the curriculum they use.</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">The spiritual disparity between the freedom of private biblical homeschoolers versus the bondage of the government homeschoolers becomes evident and can easily explode a good support group. The first set of standards strives to raise up a child loyal to the state, who views all of life from an evolutionary worldview. The other seeks to raise up a child loyal to Jesus, who views all of life from a biblical worldview. Or, does the public school mentor suggest the next logical step for a government homeschooler -- the brick and mortar public school? Government homeschoolers are a very short step away from the physical public school, and many wind up there within a short time. Currently, there is no greater threat to the biblical homeschooling movement than Christians enrolling in government homeschooling programs. The hard-fought parental rights won by the "pioneers" of the homeschool movement are at risk from Christians who are being lured into public school homeschooling programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">Since he who controls the curriculum controls the hearts and minds of the children, there is a deliberate push to get all homeschoolers under the control of the public school system. Why shouldn't all homeschoolers be evaluated by a public school teacher? Once there is a "critical mass" of government homeschoolers, there will be no one left to hold back the onerous regulations that all homeschoolers will be subject to. The politicians know that government homeschoolers pose no threat to their humanist agenda. The Christian family, and thus the nation, is in disarray, largely due to parents allowing the government to raise their children. Since public school has been such an abysmal failure both spiritually and academically, why do you think it possesses some mystical truth that you need them for? Shouldn't you have a Holy Spirit led homeschool instead of a public school led one?</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">Earlier generations made such great sacrifices -- they were hauled into court, almost had their children taken away -- they fought for your right to be free of the public school bureaucrats. Instead of becoming a dependent on government educational handouts, become an advocate of protecting our God-given rights to give our children a biblical education, free from government control. The good news is that we have found that most Christian parents who homeschool will NOT go into public school homeschooling IF they are educated on the biblical reasons not to before they get into it. Once parents are under the control of the public school system -- whether it be in a brick and mortar school or a government homeschooling program -- they are often fearful to leave even when they see the problems with it. Private biblical homeschooling is worth so much more than getting a government controlled voucher for materials. The parent who is homeschooling, however, would be better served to go out and get a job so that private school would be affordable, versus staying at home. Public schooling is at the bottom of the list and between my wife and myself both are probably more qualified to teach than alot of teachers in the public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">You can't compare a kid with low ability in the public school system to a kid with high ability in the home school arena. The studies supporthomeschooler passes the public school students at a greater rate at higher grades. So in your unsupported arguement of the negaitve influence for homeschoolers with lack of social interaction, which is very unfounded, demonstrates that homeschool parents who are concerned with negative social interaction may be on to something since academics in the public school drop drastically in comparison to homeschooling during the middle grade years. Because as students progress upwards to 12th grade the curricullum should require more distinct material, which in return should require more specializing teaching, which as you have pointed out parents are unqualified to teach. That public school students continue to digress and it becomes more specialized and homeschoolers progress greater and the disparity gap is wider. Pro's/Cons and overall do you think the pro's outway the cons? Does the school tell you that?</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">"Hey, Mr UAinAthens, we just want you to know that of the four teachers your kids have, one of them is great, one of them is good, one is average, and one is outright bad.

My wife scored over a 1500 on her SAT and received her HS diploma when she was 16. She finished her Bachelor's degree when she was 20 with summa cum laude honors at UNC. She is now back in Grad School at UNC and because of her community involvement and her 4.0 has the chance to graduate top of her class and receive egregia cum laude honors. She has no issues with social interaction and like I stated his heavily involved with many community organizations and while in undergrad was a national officer for a fraternity she was in. There's no significant difference in SAT scores among students of the same ability level. If I can find that study I'll post it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">The study does not identify the top homeschoolers. It takes into consideration all demographics. You may need to read the numbers again. It is not selective as your want to suggest. It takes the student in both settings from the same peer group and matches them. I understand the numbers are derived from averages but it is not like those averages are close to each other. There is a huge variance between the two.</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">It would actually be hard to make a fair correlation between the top because of the disparity between the two. I would actually take a guess and say in most studies the top public school performer would be considered an outlier in that comparison. The studies show the homeschooler out performs the public school student. Achievment is derived from ability. Ability comes from being prepared and taught how to articulate in the classroom. Based on the studies my conclusion would be the public schools fail in preparing the student to achieve success as they progress upward in grades. If you look at the numbers it would actually disagree with your assumptions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">At k-4 the disparity between the two is not that big of a gap. It demonstrates the gap with homeschoolers are 1 grade ahead. But between 5-8th grades the disparity grows from 1 year to 4 years. In high school that disparity continues to grow but not at the middle rate. I would have to think social interaction and peer pressure play a huge role between the 5th and 8th grades. Years that most experts will tell you are the most important for social development and can be the most detriment. Also these numbers discredit your assumption that specialty teaching should be a concern with homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">But yet the studies have shown that it is complete opposite. That even homeschoolers with parents that have no college edcuation or are certified fair just as well as those with. But yet in the public school it seems even with specialized degrees many teachers still may not be qualified to teach because so many students are falling behind. This is demonstrated by lower test scores which continue to decline along with lower acceptances rates compared to those that homeschool. I am a public school teacher. The major problem with homeschooling is I am great at teaching science. That is what I am certified in.</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">I could teach some low level Math and Social Studies wouldn't be a problem. With Language Arts I would be in trouble. There is no way I could teach all subjects and be good at it. Most parents who home school are not qualified to teach one subject let alone all of them. I know there are problems with public education. I could write all night on that but saying someone who has not had a single college level class is qualified to teach and prepare their child for college is absurd. Why I Pulled My Son Out of Public School</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">I have a lot of beefs with public school - even though some of my good friends teach public school. However, for my kid, the best place for learning has been at home. Here's why I pulled my son out of public school, and some of these might help you do so as well. There are many different reasons that someone pulls their kid out of a public school and begins the homeschooling journey. The decision to homeschool was made for many reasons. Taking my kid out of public school was the best decision I made. The decision to take your kids out of public school and teach them at home is not something that should be made lightly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">If you homeschool, what helped you make your decision? If you're thinking about homeschooling, what is making you consider the decision? It's a great place for some kids. "Your son makes himself a target for bullies." While this sentence wasn't the only reason that I pulled my kid out of the clutches of the public school in the small town we lived in, it was one of the many reasons behind my thinking. For one, I thought "Way to blame the victim here!" For another, I thought, "If the teachers aren't behind my kid, advocating for his fair treatment from classmates why is he going to this school?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">As a single parent, it's not a decision I thought I'd ever make - I mean, time is limited enough as it is. However, I still believe it was the best decision I could have made for his own growth and development. The Public School Story My story begins with a very eager student and a school system that was looking hard to place a label on him. I'm not sure if this is just my experience, but I found that being a single parent automatically raised the eyebrows of administrators in my son's two public schools. Perhaps it was because it was small town America; perhaps it was because I've been going it completely alone on the parenting path from the beginning. Whatever it was, my son became a target.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">Before the schools realized I was parenting solo, I got compliments, "He's sits so still;" "He listens well;" "He seems attentive." Shortly after parent teacher conferences when I had to explain, "No, the other person contributing to the DNA of my child will not be in attendance," things began to change for us. The "attentive" child suddenly had something wrong with him - I was told this was because he was "high risk" because, after all, I was a single parent. When I pointed out that I was also a graduate student, with a graduate student assistantship who rarely went out and worked two jobs while attending school full-time as an undergraduate, this didn't faze them. They began testing for learning disabilities. Never mind that my child was pulled out of class because he disagreed with a teacher's political views in one instance, argued that religion wasn't supposed to be in public school, and was able to do math at a higher level than other kids. They were convinced there was something wrong.</paragraph><paragraph parID="115">When we switched schools for second grade I thought, "Things are getting better" after the IEP meeting where I was told "I don't understand this diagnosis. There's nothing wrong with your child." However, my son would come home and tell me of more reasons he was pulled from class. When I asked the teachers why they were continuing this even though they'd determined he did not have a learning disability, they told me that it was because he seemed to do better when pulled from class. The Decision One reason was that my otherwise outgoing and happy child started seeming despondent, depressed, and withdrawn. He'd often come home from school either in tears or close to tears.</paragraph><paragraph parID="116">He was being bullied. He was tired of being pulled out of class and feeling like he had no clue what was going on in school. He said the words "I hate myself" to me. Something needed to change. I looked into private schools, but they were overpriced and not close enough to home. As an 8th grader, and again for the first semester of my 11th grade year, I had been homeschooled. My brother had been homeschooled from fifth grade on.</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">It seemed like a natural choice - especially when I was called in yet again about a bullying incident at a school that had a "no bullying policy" to be told that my kid made himself a target. I was afraid he'd grow up to feel like there was something wrong with him that made people and administrators pick on him. I was afraid that he'd be lost in the system. I was afraid he'd get put into the public school's dumping ground of special education. So, in February of 2007, I lined everything up. My child did not set foot in his classroom again, I had a curriculum purchased and lesson plans set up, and we began our journey at the kitchen table in my small grad student apartment. The Reflection</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">It was very difficult to homeschool as a single parent , I won't lie. However, within three months, my son went from struggling reader to working at grade level in every subject except reading - where he'd jumped from emergent reader to reading at a fifth grade level. Since then, we've been through ups and downs, from falling behind because of life stuff, to catching up within a matter of weeks, to being ahead. At the time of this article, he was in "7th grade" working at a high school &amp;amp; college level in reading, history, and science, learning four languages, and working through an algebra book. Kids develop at different rates - and the administrators at the public school were right, he did thrive with individual attention - my individual attention. Instead, it should be done with a lot of forethought. While to some people it seemed impulsive, I'd been studying methods for homeschooling for a while and implementing them when I could after school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">Be sure you understand your state and local rules governing homeschooling. Most of all, have fun! Your kids only have one childhood. How do you want them to remember it? Homeschooling through charter schools or public school independent study programs is actually a form of public education, and thus falls outside of HSLDA's mission. HSLDA support tax deductions for all educational expenses, similar to deductions for charitable giving or educational tax credits. Recently, several states have enacted legislation requiring public school access for homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">HSLDA takes a neutral position when legislation of this kind is introduced, unless the legislation would impose additional regulations on all homeschool students not participating in the public schools. What is HSLDA&#146;s position on homeschool students&#146; use of special education and related services benefits through the public schools? HSLDA believes the parent whose child receives related services at the public school is still a home educator. HSLDA will not assist homeschool students to obtain access to special education in the public school ( see number 6, below, for the reason ). If the investigation focuses on homeschooling, we will represent you until the matter is resolved. HSLDA membership benefits do not extend to representation should court action result on non-homeschooling matters. HSLDA is frequently contacted by individuals or associations in foreign countries asking for help with homeschooling issues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">The types of inquiries range from individuals who are being prosecuted for homeschooling to those who are seeking to change their country&#146;s law to improve the atmosphere for homeschooling, or who are establishing their own homeschool association. We have assigned Mike Donnelly, HSLDA staff attorney, to assist, wherever possible, homeschoolers in other countries where the law is difficult or does not provide for homeschooling. HSLDA has provided information to parents in many other countries who want to set up homeschool legal defense organizations. We are currently working with homeschoolers in South Africa, Brazil, Germany, and Sweden among others, to establish the freedom to homeschool in those countries. Why doesn't HSLDA represent the parent seeking to homeschool in divorce cases? HSLDA's primary mission is to protect the legal right of parents to homeschool from agents of the state. In truancy and educational neglect cases it is the state versus the parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">One exception to our basic rule is if a judge rules that homeschooling is illegal, which would have consequences statewide and not just for the parties to the divorce case. In those cases we will defend the legality of home education in that state. You may periodically receive mailings from the Home School Foundation , which is a nonprofit organization directly related to HSLDA. It is common for public school districts to disqualify credits of homeschoolers transferring into public high school. Consistent with our mission to conserve our resources for helping parents who continue to homeschool, we are not able to extend our advocacy to situations where parents are enrolling their students in public school. Please be aware that this limitation extends to public charter school programs. HSLDA's mission is to advance the cause of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">We provide professional legal representation for your homeschooling. You&#146;ll receive email e-lerts on local, state, national, and international homeschooling issues. You&#146;ll be able to participate in our Online Curriculum Market, where you can save a lot of money buying and selling homeschool-related materials and books. In it, we report important information about new laws and court cases that affect homeschoolers, as well as other information about HSLDA&#146;s activity on behalf of our members and items of interest to the homeschooling community. Access to HSLDA's Homeschooling Thru High School Program: Two high school coordinators are available to our members for personal consultations regarding questions about homeschooling through high school. This includes consultations with coordinators who can assist you in diagnosing and developing a plan for addressing your homeschooled child's special needs. Access to HSLDA's Homeschooling Thru the Early Years Program: Our Early Years coordinator is available to our members for personal consultations regarding questions about homeschooling from Pre-K through middle school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="124">However, in practice, we have come to the aid of our members and many non-members to protect and advance the right of all to homeschool. Despite society&#146;s doubt and skepticism, homeschoolers have become a significant demographic in America with impressive, consistent academic achievement and post-graduate success. HSLDA has initiated research and compiled statistical evidence of homeschool achievement in conjunction with the National Home Education Research Institute. We do not have an official position regarding the United Nations. However, it is accurate to say that we've become more and more concerned about the sovereignty of the United States vis-&#224;-vis the United Nations as expressed by its policies on religious liberty, human rights, children's rights, and the family. The UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child is an example of the UN's view of the family. We oppose the UN Treaty on the Rights of the Child because it would strip parents of much of their authority to educate, train, and nurture their children according to the dictates of their conscience.</paragraph><paragraph parID="125">We do not take a position on gun ownership. In 12 states, homeschoolers operate as private schools under the private school law of that state. Many states and the federal government have laws that make it illegal to have a gun within 1,000 feet of any school. After concerns expressed by member families who live within 1,000 feet of a school and own guns, we asked the United States Attorney General&#146;s Office whether this law applied to private homeschools or not. The United States Attorney General&#146;s Office has indicated that the law does not apply to these private homeschool situations. In every contact with a social worker/police officer regarding allegations of abuse or neglect, HSLDA provides assistance and advice to our member families. HSLDA has in the past, and may choose in the future, to take cases where there has been a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</paragraph><paragraph parID="126">We reserve the right to accept such cases at our sole discretion. On the federal level, we oppose legislation that would reduce parental freedoms and promote legislation that would increase parental freedoms and strengthen the family. In state legislatures, we work in conjunction with the state organizations towards the same goals. In representing the best interests of our members, we build consensus with the state leadership before we attempt any legislative initiative in a state. As a result of that cooperation, we have worked together with many homeschool leaders to improve the law. What is HSLDA&#146;s involvement, if any, in the international growth of home education? We will not establish a branch of HSLDA in a foreign country.</paragraph><paragraph parID="127">The giving of legal advice by an HSLDA attorney establishes an attorney-client relationship which places upon the attorney certain ethical obligations toward the client. Normally, an attorney would require payment of a retainer to establish this relationship. HSLDA establishes this relationship through membership. Providing legal advice to non-members requires a commitment on our part without a return commitment on the part of the client. In divorce cases, however, it is father versus mother. Because they cannot agree, the judge must decide what's best for the children based on the evidence before him. Also, divorce cases involve many issues besides education and are often protracted and bitter.</paragraph><paragraph parID="128">And they are very costly. After careful consideration, we long ago determined that we simply do not have the resources to represent parents in divorce cases. Additionally, on many occasions, the breakup of the marriage comes after the parents joined HSLDA as husband and wife. Because both parents either are or have been HSLDA members we cannot represent an interest contrary to either spouse, even though one may be trying to keep the other from homeschooling. What are the benefits of joining HSLDA? * We also offer several other benefits for our members.

After a family joins HSLDA, there are no further charges of any kind for defending them in court. HSLDA pays in full all attorney fees, expert witness fees, court transcript cost, travel expenses, and all other court costs permissible by state law for us to pay. We offer a discount to families who are members of a participating discount group, a full-time pastor, full-time missionary, or active/retired/disabled military.

This is because we automatically debit the account information for you each month. No, HSLDA does not send out reminders or bills. The payments are directly debited from your account on the date designated on HSLDA's membership application. You may cancel the automatic charges at any time by paying the balance due for the remainder of the current membership year. Please note that we are unable to refund your setup service fee. For example: If you are paying $10/month (which works out to $120/year), and you have made two payments totaling $20.00, your remaining balance will be $100.00.</paragraph><paragraph parID="132">Membership is for a minimum term of one year.

Your application will need to be reviewed by the legal department. HSLDA reserves the right not to approve any membership application. All we ask is that you keep a record of what your child learns so we can defend you should your homeschooling methods come under scrutiny. To date, most charter school programs and all public school independent study programs have been enacted with restrictions regarding religious education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="134">This means that it is unethical and possibly illegal for any religious education to occur during the process of teaching any academic subject through these programs. Keep in mind that programs receiving government funding can be directly regulated by governmental standards. We understand that the financial pressures faced by families today make publicly subsidized educational programs very attractive. But if accepting government subsidies forfeits your right to teach your children in the way you desire, that price is very high indeed. The College's distinctives include a deliberate outreach to home schooled students; practical apprenticeship methodology; financial independence; a general education core based on the classical liberal arts; a dedication to mentoring and discipling Christian students; and a community life that promotes virtue, leadership, and strong, life-long commitments to God, family and society. What is HSLDA's position on charter schools and public school independent study programs? The mission of Home School Legal Defense Association has always been to defend the rights of families who desire to privately homeschool their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="135">It is our longstanding policy not to accept as HSLDA members families whose children are enrolled in such a public school option. Parents have the right to choose whatever form of education they wish for their children. However, we urge those considering charter schools or public school independent study programs to count the cost, making sure they are fully informed. For example, religious content in a history or English class covered by the official program would be a statutory violation. (This would not be a constitutional violation by the parents&#151;only the government can violate the Constitution. The Constitution has been interpreted to permit but not require states to fund religious education as a component of a broad general program. This means that whatever the state statutes say is binding.</paragraph><paragraph parID="136">If the statutes ban religious instruction in programs funded by the government, then program participants&#151;including homeschooling parents&#151;who teach religious content are violating the law.) For example, teaching homosexuality as an acceptable alternate lifestyle may well soon become a universal requirement for public schools&#151;including charter schools and public school independent study programs. But even tax deductions would be unacceptable if the mechanisms adopted allow any governmental interference or regulation of content in homeschool programs. Both HSLDA's experience and the combined history of our nation and western civilization continually demonstrate that with government funding comes government regulation. The price is too high. What is HSLDA&#146;s position on access to public school facilities and activities? HSLDA&#146;s board of directors has remained steadfast in focusing our resources on maintaining and advancing the freedom of homeschoolers from public school oversight.</paragraph><paragraph parID="137">Therefore, the board will not allow HSLDA to use our resources to force public school districts to allow homeschool children access. If I stop homeschooling, will HSLDA help me persuade public school officials to accept my child's homeschool credits? To this end, we advocate for homeschoolers when the legitimacy of their diploma is questioned, for instance, by colleges, employers or military recruiters. As a general rule, homeschooling only becomes an issue in a divorce case when the parents cannot agree with each other about the children's education. What is impossible, because the numbers posted demonstrate that is wrong, college acceptance is at a higher % for homeschoolers in the top tier institutions, and many posters have stated from personal experience your though here is wrong. Question: Homeschooling? For instance, there are circuit court of appeals opinions that have held that once you drop your children off at the school house door, the school has absolute control over what your children are taught.</paragraph><paragraph parID="138">Before I had children, I admired parents who home schooled their children. Once Hannah was born on April 8, 2004, home schooling her and our future children weighed more and more on our minds. In time, my wife and I became convinced together that home schooling was the right choice for us. Originally published in 1995 and updated in 2000, Home Schooling is less a defense of home schooling than it is an argument for why you, too, should home school. Home Schooling begins with an indictment of public schools, underscoring its propositional rather than defensive nature. He also sets forth practical steps to successful home schooling--providing the encouragement you need to realize that you can do it--as well as the success home schoolers have in college. The book also includes a number of helpful appendices, including "The Difference Between Christian Education and Humanistic Education," "Fifteen Reasons to Home School Your Teenagers," and "The Social Worker Skit: How to Handle a Visit From a Social Worker."</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">The one criticism of the book that I can muster is Klicka's reliance on substantive due process arguments for the constitutional right to home school. In any event, Home Schooling is the perfect book for people already home schooling who will be encouraged that they have made the right decision and will gain a greater appreciation of the sacrifices those who started home schooling in the 1980s made, for people thinking about home schooling but are not sure they can do it, and for people trying to understand why their friends and family are home schooling rather than doing what just about everyone else does. I enjoyed this post in part because this particular homeschooled student writes better than most students in grad school. Fire in Mine Ears , a recent homeschool graduate, discusses "The Question." This colors our way of thinking about many things. Fundamentally, it is reflected in what we believe is truth. All truth is God's truth.</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">Man's knowledge is limited. We think we know something only to find that future generations have found that we really didn't know what we are talking about. The truth is that God created the family. It is God's view of the family that is reflected in our western civilization and in our law until very recently. If we tear down this God-based view of the family, then all of the God-based principles in our society are ultimately at risk. The reason we have parental rights is because our law assumes that God gave children to parents, not the state. If we eliminate the assumption of God from our law, parental rights and human rights themselves are impossible.</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">They asked, "Where are such rights based in any international legal document?" I answered, "If rights are based on man-made documents they are not rights, they are privileges. What man makes, man can change." Related services, on the other hand, are aids to a child&#151;like speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. These services indirectly improve a child&#146;s ability to learn, but are separate from traditional academic curricula. HSLDA may assist homeschool families seeking related services that have been denied because of homeschooling. We view this as a basic fairness issue in that homeschool students in private school states are entitled to related services according to the U.S. Department of Education, but those in homeschool states are not.</paragraph><paragraph parID="142">We homeschool our children because we believe it is the best path for their own future and for the impact that they can have on our nation and the generations that follow.

If you are mailing your application, you must use overnight mail to ensure expedition. Many people who consider themselves advocates of children's rights and of the protection of children from the limitations or abuses of their parents argue that children should regularly be under the supervision of and in contact with agents of the state or otherwise qualified professionals. As another example, some scholars argue that state institutional schools provide a forum that frees children from the regressive, selfish, or antipublic influences of their parents and gives the population at large a way to evolve into a more benevolent or broad-minded societal state (Apple 2000). In other words, it is argued that one of the chief functions of state schools is to protect children from the behaviors, beliefs, and world-views of their parents (Richman 1994).</paragraph><paragraph parID="143">Most homeschool parents, on the other hand, think it is better for children to remain under their guidance and supervision and be protected from the state (Klicka 1995; Mayberry et al. 1995). The family, they explain, is the natural and nurturing buffer between the child himself and the state and the wider world. They think that they, rather than the state, should be training their offspring, the future citizens and leaders of the nation. Advocates of institutional schooling, state-controlled in particular, continue to promote these schools as the key opportunity of advancement for disadvantaged persons and families (i.e., lower class, poor, minorities). Homeschooling - State Versus Family In the United States about 88 percent of all citizens are educated in public schools for their primary and secondary school years. Homeschooling is the antithesis to this arrangement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">Home-based education moves the locus of control over academic education, skill training, and indoctrination to the parents and the family system, both nuclear and extended. These parents would agree with the political scientist James W. Skillen (1998, p. 3; see also Carlson 1993) that free societies should have a high view of the relationship between parents and their children as opposed to the state's intervention in families' and children's lives (Adams, Stein, and Wheeler 1989; Arons 1983; Klicka 1995; Mayberry et al. 1995). At the same time, however, it is ". . . true that every public-legal attempt to 'liberate' minor children from parents makes the minors subject to whatever legal, medical or other authority is then authorized to direct or influence their actions." Homeschool parents and advocates argue that parent-led, family-based education retains parental authority and primary influence over a child's education, protects the child from the state, and increases the familial bond between children and their parents, siblings, and kin groups. In contrast, when the state takes power and authority over education for itself and away from parents in the form of state-run schools, children are not only not liberated from all external authorities but one of the most important nongovernmental institutions of society-the family-is weakened by the ample power of the state (Adams, Stein, and Wheeler 1989; Klicka 1995; Apple 2000). Home-based education is consistent with the concept of the natural and strong family with human beings identified, as Skillen explained, ". . . as persons-in-community and the family as the foremost community for children. . ." (p. 5). Home-school parents are reclaiming for the family at large in society, and for their families in particular, the powerful and influential political, social, philosophical, and generational role they once had by reclaiming the education of children (Farris and Woodruff 2000; Lines 1994; Ray 2000a).</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">In fact, the largest teachers' union in America, the National Education Association (2001), believes that state-controlled schooling is the cornerstone of social, economic, and political structure, and homeschooling cannot provide students with a comprehensive education experience. Now, however, an increasing number of scholars (Carlson 1995; Loberfeld 2001; Ray 2000a) and parents (Aizenman 2000; National Black Home Educators Resource Association 2001) are considering the proposition that keeping education under the direct authority and control of parents may better ensure an offering of intellectual, social, political, and spiritual freedom to individual children and youth-regardless of class, minority status, or advantage-who will eventually be the political citizens of any nation. For example, although state (public) schools had been desegregated in the United States since 1954, black (African American) students are still far below their white peers in terms of academic achievement in public (state) schools a half-century later. During the early 2000s, a new wave of parents, internationally (Large 2000), are expecting homeschooling to raise their children's academic achievement, improve their social success, increase their thinking skills, and enhance their potential for personal and national freedom.

The only reason they avoided actually sagging the drop-out statistics even further is because, allegedly, of the Public school unethically unloading them as fraudulent "home school" kids. No drop-outs on our books!</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">1) These kids were already drop-outs as public-schooled kids. Their failure is the Public School's failure. Their failure is the State's failure. 2) Many of the flunkies would have ended up on social welfare programs anyway, however they were schooled. The only thing that has been improved here, then, is the Public School's drop-out statistic. Think about it for a bit, part of the reason the schools are using this loophole, is because they have failed to teach the kids. Why do Christian parents send their kids to public schools?</paragraph><paragraph parID="148">Kids going to public schools spend most of their time fellowshipping with unbelievers, and sleeping. I find it offensive to suggest the overwhelming failure (up to 50% or more national drop out rate in some areas) should regulate the market whose success is far higher. Homeschooling is not easy, and I will admit that I have my days when I want to quit, but then I remember that I would be throwing them to the wolves. McDurmon's personal critisism of Stein should be ignored unless you know Pastor Stein personally. But then, that's the original issue, isn't it? Please note two things: The schools are regulated by the Government.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">So, how can you expect that extending that regulation to homeschools will help? Anyway, that's not what I really wanted to emphazise. See this quote from McDurmon: People worship God on Sunday, speak of God and family-then willingly herd their children into largely pagan asylums all day for five days a week. In these prisons of Statist corruption and vice, children are desensitized to everything about God and family. Christian parents willingly render their children to Caesar. This is something that has puzzled me for a long time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="150">My response in my mind to that is very rude. How is it possible to believe that kids with little life experience, who are barely making their faith their own, to resist the un-Christian influence of the Public School system? Think about it, how do you strengthen your faith? By spending time in God's Word, and by fellowshipping with fellow believers. That is not healthy. So, I believe that Christian parents should only send their kids to school if they can't homeschool them. And public schools should be the absolute last choice.</paragraph><paragraph parID="151">I agree with you. I don't understand why Christian parents are so set on public schools, either, depending on their location. In North Dakota, where my husband grew up, they do things differently. They have higher standards than the rest of the country, and they are more likely to have Christian teachers in their schools that do not teach Evolution as fact. However, that is the exception, not the rule. Expecting your children to be able to "evangelize" in public school is foolish. Youth groups at church don't seem to be able to keep the children in the pews, either.</paragraph><paragraph parID="152">How can we expect our children to grow up in faith if we do not immerse them in it before they are old enough to be sent out on their own? Which is more important? To be a math whiz, history genius, and science guru? Or to have saving faith in Jesus Christ? Our children don't have to grow up to be doctors and lawyers to be productive members of society. We need trash collectors and UPS truck drivers, too. What is most important is that they are grounded in Jesus Christ so that their eternal life -- the most important life they have -- is sure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="153">Great brief review. As I was reading your blog I thought to myself what a huge statement you made in such a simple response, noting yourself as a well educated man. The hard work of your parents has paid off. I am a homeschooling Mom of three children. But I really liked how you put it when you said, Public schools are some of the most profoundly un-Christian environments around. His response? No problems here!</paragraph><paragraph parID="154">Good points! Many parents as well as students are often concerned about the Socialization factor when considering home schooling. Parents sometimes feel their children might miss out on the social contact or interaction between students in a traditional school setting. However, some see the possibly detrimental side to today's public school system. So many children find themselves and their studies actually suffering due to social complications that would not exist in a home school setting. Socialization: The S Word My objection to the social life of almost all schools . . . is that it is for the most part mean-spirited, competitive, ruthless, snobbish, conformist, consumerist, fickle, heartless, and often cruel. Most children come out of school with far less self-esteem, less sense of their own identity, dignity, and worth, than they had when they went in.</paragraph><paragraph parID="155">Perhaps of most importance are the opportunities simply to spend time with people of all ages, experience, and points of view. One fascinating aspect of the society described in The Continuum Concept is that the children, included from infancy in the business of the village, have a smooth transition into adulthood without what has come to be accepted as the universal truth of adolescence: rebellion. The vast majority of children are segregated in school by age (leaving aside the obvious fact that by virtue of their geographical location and economic background, they are also usually segregated by race, culture, or class). They spend a large proportion of their waking time learning from, competing with, and being compared to each other, jockeying for position among their peers and approval from their teachers. The pressures to fit in and to succeed are very powerful to children and when the seal of approval comes from outside the child and not from his or her own sense of achievement, an important element of self-trust, of knowing inside when something is right or true or good or valuable, may be compromised. The other regrettable byproduct of this system is the Us versus Them mentality it fosters. And the brains - sometimes by choice, sometimes by proclamation, are rarely part of the in-crowd.</paragraph><paragraph parID="156">It's our class against their class, and the students versus the teacher. The big kids versus the little kids. And, of course, kids versus parents. This lays some pretty effective groundwork for an worldview attitude of my beliefs versus theirs, my people versus yours. If you're considering homeschooling but are worried about your child's social development, you'll soon find that your community is full of resources where homeschooled children interact with other kids. Just for starters, there's the YMCA or YWCA, local community centers and sports teams, Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs, church or synagogue groups, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire, and coordinated activities with other homeschooled kids. Being out in the world engenders in children a sense of reality.</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">They see what goes on all day in the business of life, and where they fit in. They see how adults manage day-to-day details and long-range plans, and they learn to handle and accept the balance of success and failure, of struggle and recreation. Children recognize their value to the community as they do their part to contribute, and they understand the role of the community in their own lives, as a resource and support. There are the cool kids and there are the dweebs, dorks, and losers. Worried About Social Activities?

Will my Home School child be a social outcast? Think about it. What we want is to see the child in pursuit of knowledge, and not knowledge in pursuit of the child. - George Bernard Shaw by Jay Ambrose How do you spell "home-schooling"?</paragraph><paragraph parID="161">With respect. The winner of this year's Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee is Sean Conley, a 13-year-old educated at home until he started private school this past year, just as last year's winner was also home-schooled. Those facts would not say much about the value of home-schooling if there were no broad-based studies showing that children taught by their parents - usually the mother - are more academically accomplished on average than children taught by professional teachers in public schools. There are. Home-schooling, which used to be legal in just a few states, is now legal in all of them and is growing rapidly; it is the path being taken by more than 1 million students. Parents, it is noted, are taking advantage of all kinds of resources - websites, special publications, libraries, community colleges, tutors for some subjects, various associations where their children can acquire social skills - and are doing so at a cost much more affordable than private schools. The parents, it is also noted, are usually college-educated members of the middle class aiming above all to enrich their children's minds to a degree unlikely to occur in public schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="162">Simultaneously, they are trying to afford those children the best protection they can from the worst of the popular culture. Review articles on what has been happening and naturally enough you will find critics. You will also find they are having to eat their words as these disciplined, self-sacrificing parents do what public schools could not do even if they shook off their bureaucratic fetters and resistance to change: tailor lessons to individual talents and enthusiasms, inculcate cherished values and strengthen family life. Home-schooling has its drawbacks, it is not a success in every instance and it is not something all parents are suited for. All of that should be obvious. But it should also be obvious that certain self-interested parties should not be allowed to strangle it with too many regulations, as is reportedly being tried in some states, and it should be obvious that it is an educational option that is serving our society well.

My mom home schools me because she wants to spend her time with me. That makes me feel good.</paragraph><paragraph parID="164">My mom also doesn't push me to do something too hard or too fast because she understands my feelings. I don't like being pushed past the limit of what I want to do at that moment. (But if she knows I can do something which I think I can't, she may push me a little.) There are normally about 30 kids in a class and only one teacher so the teacher doesn't have spare time to spend with each and every one of the kids. When one of kids does something wrong, the teacher may send the kid off to the principal instead of talking to him or her and trying to put things right. Teachers are able to dish out homework and make the kids do it even if it's too hard or too much for them. The teacher doesn't know each child well enough to know what is and what isn't too hard, but with home schoolers it is always their mom who gives them homework or assignments to do and what I think is that kids' mothers should know more about what is too hard or too much for their kids than teachers do.</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">I say "should know" because some parents don't really seem to know their own kids very well. Well it's not surprising, since they may not see them very much! I have heard some kids (especially boys) are given Ritalin to keep them calm in class because too many kids are hard for only one teacher to control. Another good thing I like about home school is that I have good equipment at home: my own computer and educational software and musical instruments and other things like that. These might be in school but if there were things like that in school, then the kids would probably have to take turns. At my home, my brother and I don't have to fight over who goes first because we each have our own. (I am not meaning to brag about the things my brother and I have.</paragraph><paragraph parID="166">It's just that if kids DO have their own stuff at home, it's better.) At school the kids don't usually do chores. I live on a boat. On a boat, there are a lot of chores to do. I get school credit for everything I learn, including how to do chores correctly. In school the kids are controlled by a bell. When the bell rings the kids have to stop whatever they are doing, whether they are finished or not, and run to the next class, hoping to be on time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="167">Kids usually go to school five days a week for up to six hours each day whereas I don't even spend six hours a week on schoolwork and I learn just as much as they do. School wastes too much time!! If I or my brother want to learn something that my parents don't feel qualified to teach us, then we get a private teacher to help out. We have had music and art teachers come by our home and we have also gone out for karate, music, acting and ice skating lessons.

Some will add that they would like their children to be able to make moral and ethical choices and to contribute to society in some meaningful way. Most of these outcomes are pushed aside, however, in any discussion of education. Then, the discussion shifts to talk about standards (which are invariably seen to be falling), a lack of accountability (by school staff, education authorities and so on) and a call for a return to the basics. Institutions offering courses which promise increases in results draw large numbers of children, providing extra assistance or enrichment in core areas such as reading and mathematics. Few parents or teachers stop to notice the contradiction between the long-term outcomes they want for their children, and the methods being employed. A clarification needs to be made at this point.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">This is not another diatribe against Outcome Based Education. Nor is it a criticism of already de-motivated but hard-working teachers. Rather it is a critique of the institution of school per s&#233;. As far as curricula go, our new one is not too bad. It looks for outcomes similar to those mentioned in the first paragraph. The reason it cannot work to achieve those goals has nothing to do with it's contents or structure. The problem is systemic embedded in the very structure and ethos of the institutions mandated to deliver it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">The public school as we know it was inherited almost unchanged from Prussia, where it was invented to serve two markets: the demand of industry for compliant workers who would be prepared to perform repetitive and mindless tasks on a production line; and the demands of the army for even more compliant soldiers. As the Generals had discovered at the Battle of Jenna, soldiers who think for themselves tend to run away when the odds are against them. This system was quickly adopted by Britain, and later transferred to its colonies, including South Africa. This little tidbit of history is well-known. What is less well understood is it is not the curriculum, the actual content of what is taught that makes the difference. Rather, it is the way the day is broken up into short periods, the way in which children are denied control over their own bodily functions, the rigid hierarchy, the denial of personal choice and autonomy, quality control (in the form of regular, extrinsic assessments), the lack of meaningful representation, and the reliance on a crude behaviourialist system of control that make schools what they are . Society has become so used to the institution of school that we find it difficult to conceive learning happening outside of a traditional classroom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="172">The facts, however, give a very different picture. Schools as we know them are a relatively new invention, and the largest proportion of the population generally didn't attend school until well into the 20th century. Neuroscientists and educationalists researching just exactly how learning takes place in the context of how the brain functions are now showing that most of what children learn, they learn when they are not in school because the very system is such that it discourages the cognitive functions necessary for learning to take place. In order to learn more, children need less teaching, not more. They need more movement, more hands-on activity, more interaction, and probably the most surprising, more play. A father liked to read his young son fairy tales at night. Having a deep-rooted sense of humour, he often ad-libs parts of the stories for fun.</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">One day his son was sitting in his first grade class as the teacher was reading the story of the "Three Little Pigs." She came to the part of the story where the first pig was trying to acquire building materials for his home. She said, "And so the pig went up to the man with a wheel barrow full of straw and said 'Pardon me sir, but might I have some of that straw to build my house with?'" The teacher then asks the class, "And what do you think that man said?" My friend's son raised his hand and exclaimed, "I know! I know! - 'Holy smokes!</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">A talking pig!'" ... the teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes. When reading the following article, bear in mind that, though middle class homes have members that use a wide variety of vocabulary words for children to absorb, the children may, in fact, be spending the largest portion (up to 10 hours) of their waking time each day with their caregiver , who may have a large vocabulary - but probably doesn't... The Vocabulary Deficit by Andrew Wolf Why do poor children have so much trouble learning to read? One of our nation's great educational theorists, E D Hirsch Jr, and a number of other researchers, writing in the American Educator , the magazine of the American Federation of Teachers, have an answer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">They present a compelling argument that the primary reason these children fall behind is a huge vocabulary deficit. This deficit puts them at an increasing disadvantage as they get older and the material they must read becomes more complex. Mr Hirsch is the author of The Schools We Need and Why We Don't Have Them , the book I generously purchased for the schools chancellor, Joel Klein, when he assumed his job last summer. Unfortunately, Mr Klein seems to have lost his copy. None of the educational decisions he has made so far reflect an understanding of Mr Hirsch's sound ideas. According to Mr Hirsch, "A 12 th grade student who scores well enough on the verbal portion of the SAT to get into a selective college knows between 60,000 and 100,000 words." If we average this out to 80,000 words, and assume that the period of vocabulary acquisition of our high school senior is the 15 years between age 2 and 17, our student needs to learn an average of fifteen words a day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="176">This is not going to happen in school alone. "Most vocabulary words," Mr Hirsch argues, result "incidentally, from massive immersion in the world of language and knowledge." The shortfall in vocabulary is easy enough to explain. A study by well-regarded researchers Betty Hart and Todd Risley, which also appears in the American Educator , concludes that the number of words children hear addressed to them increases dramatically with family income. A child of professionals is likely to hear as many as 50 million words by age 4. The child of a welfare parent may be exposed to just a quarter of that number. The benefits will far outweigh the problems.</paragraph><paragraph parID="177">As violence in the schools escalates, more and more people are choosing this method of educating their children. Perhaps in due time there will be less opposition and more understanding. Always remember when you run into problems that someone else has probably had the same problem and may even have found a solution. Another reason people quit homeschooling is because it takes so much time and energy. There will undoubtedly be pressure from many sources to put your children into "real school" meaning the public or private school system. In Louisiana, you can register as a home study family or you can register as a private school. I n most cases, Mom is the Teacher and Dad functions as Principal though it may happen that your circumstances are different.</paragraph><paragraph parID="178">You will now be purchasing textbooks (possibly for several children your first year) where before their school supplied these. If, on the other hand, you see that your child is just enjoying being a child, and doesn't seem interested in formal learning yet, is not bothered by the fact that his peers are reading and being schooled, and it doesn't bother you, put it off and wait. Just be sure that at the end of the year you have the number of days the state requires&#151;in Louisiana this is 180 days. If you follow the public school year closely, this might mean that you teach on a Saturday or take a shorter Christmas or Easter break. Once again, the choice is yours so long as you follow the state regulations as to number of days. Some people choose a very relaxed school atmosphere. Some like to "have school at home."</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">There are usually workshops on different subjects and the speakers can help you with problems you may be having as well as give the good or bad points of a particular curriculum. Many of these dealers are families just like yours who found a need and sought to fill it and get some additional income to help defray their own homeschooling expenses. When you begin to homeschool, another thing you need to consider is testing. Do you intend to test your child using a standardized test at the end of the year? Some allow parents to administer tests under specific conditions. For Preschool I used Sonlight's preschool packet and Rod and Staff's preschool books. For First Grade for Kati I used Calvert .</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">If I had it to do over, I think I would continue with Calvert as it was a good program, easy to use, and comprehensive though it only goes through 8th grade. For Science we have mostly used A Beka , but one year (3rd) we did Eagles Wings, which was good but it's basically a one year text. note: I am planning to get a Chemistry video from The Teaching Company for next year. We've used ' Wordly Wise, Analogies and Megawords by EPS , Creative Writing, Wordsmith, Word Roots, Easy Grammar, Daily Grams, Learning Language Arts Through Literature, and Learning English through the Bible. My son also attends AWANA and is doing much better this year in Bible memory and, in fact, everything. :-) I am using the Explorer Bible Study on Genesis this year with him. For Foreign Language I've used The Learnables and Power-Glide .</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">We've used the Critical Thinking Press books like Mindbenders, Dr. Doriddle, Thinkagrams. I've used the Ed Hirsch books on occasion. My kids have done well on standardized tests and our school runs pretty smoothly - most of the time. You may be disillusioned by the public and/or private school system you&#146;ve been involved with. You may begin homeschooling for religious reasons &#151;to integrate your belief in God into your curriculum. You may do it for financial reasons. You can't afford private school and don't want to send your children to public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="182">You may want to protect your children from exposure to the violence and drugs sadly present within today's school systems. You may want to strengthen your family life. You may feel that through homeschooling your children will get a better education, academically, socially, and spiritually. You may simply feel that this is what God is leading you to do. The greatest thing about homeschooling is choice . Commitment is essential to successful homeschooling. There are many reasons why people decide to homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="183">Your reasons are your own. You can choose to share them. You can choose to join with other like-minded families for support. You can choose to keep them to yourself. You have such a multitude of choices and they are all yours to make. Do you have to make them alone? You have information as close as your state and local support group and your library.</paragraph><paragraph parID="184">Of course the final decision must be yours. Both parents should agree, whatever the decision. Do you have a commitment to your children's education? Do you have a need that homeschooling can meet? I'm not asking if you're smart enough, or if your kids listen to you&#151;do you really want to do it? Why do people sometimes decide not to homeschool, or give up after one year? One reason might be that they need to have two incomes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">While it is possible to homeschool when both parents work, it is more difficult. Another reason might be a lack of confidence in their ability to teach their children or make their children do their lessons. With experience and a firm hand, this problem usually takes care of itself. HSLDA, for a current fee of $100/year, will defend you against any accusations you may incur from the school board or child welfare, such as truancy or child neglect. If you are not teaching your own child, they will not accept you as they defend parents ' rights. If you are a member of a qualifying group, (ask your group leader), you get a discount of $15.00 on your HSLDA membership. They will also supply you with the current laws of any other state if you ask them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">Perhaps you're thinking of moving and need to know the laws there. Once you have this information in hand, you can do your homework. Research, contact other homeschoolers and find out if anyone has dealt with the same problem you have and what materials worked best for them. The best place for a child who needs special help is obviously with the people who care the most about him&#151;you, the parents. Probably, you are the one who noticed the problem in the first place. Different disabilities require different strategies for teaching. You want to be challenging but not frustrating just as with any other child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">Use your library to learn what the symptoms are&#151;don't take your doctor's word only, though certainly don't ignore him. It may be a challenging prospect for both of you and you may need extra help, encouragement and prayer but, in all likelihood, you can do it. Sometimes students in a group can get together for testing if they are using the same grade tests. Ask other homeschool parents or your support group officers, what is accepted in your state. Science - 3-4 credits which might include Biology, Physical Science, Chemistry - you can also go on to Earth Science, Physics, Geology, Oceanography, Astronomy etc. if you really like Science and use these as electives. Elections are taking place, newspapers keep us abreast of current events, TV shows often will use historical references during their story lines, the History Channel, historical fiction etc., study of opinions versus facts, journalism vs. creative writing. If you homeschool throughout the high school years and buy books from different publishers your child will not get a diploma unless he takes the GED test or you make your own.</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">The GED or proficiency tests can help with employers who are unfamiliar with homeschooling and require proof of graduation. If the vouchers people ever get what they want, look out home schoolers. In fact look out any place where the people there think they're doing education, but which the government does not now control. I'm worried that they're not learning much, but there's no way of finding out. They don't take the national curriculum tests. All that Kent County Council does is send an educational psychologist round once a year. Are there no national standards?</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">Don't we care about home-educated children? Or as she puts it, "Home "Educating"(?)" Alice also included a link to something called Choice in Education , although in a manner which suggests that maybe this was a temporary error on her part. I've categorised this as Home Schooling, because this is me, schooling myself, at home. My husband and I never (and I mean NEVER!) thought of home-schooling our kids, but I used to threaten them with homeschooling from time to time and it really put 'the fear of God into them' as they say. The Political World seems to indulge in a regular pattern of focussing in on a particular category of people who between them will Sort Out The Mess in whatever situation is now a mess, Get A Grip, Take A Lead, until such time as this group of people are likewise revealed as being only human and just as incapable of doing the impossible as any other group of people.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">But instead of recognising that no one is omnipotent or omniscient, and accepting the necessity of a free society in which no one is even pretending to be omnipotent or omniscient &#65533; because that would be too humiliating, and would involve admitting that too many disreputable people had been right all along and too many respectable people had been wrong all along &#65533; the answer to each crisis of failed omnicompetence is "solved" simply by appointing another category of persons who this time, this time, will work the miracle. His wife said: "It's a relief to have him home. We were worried out of our minds. Give it a few years, and they too will find themselves under that special form of intense public scrutiny &#65533; more like the bitter row between lovers falling out of love than a serious policy debate &#65533; that happens when yet again, education nirvana has proved elusive and yet another Omnicompetent Group is dethroned. After all giving Head Teachers nervous breakdowns is not quite the same as making education any better, now is it? There is a real danger that Home-Educating Parents will, eventually, any decade now, be identified in Britain as education's latest Omnicompetent Group. The people who now choose to do Home-Ed, in defiance of the conventions of their time, are mostly doing amazingly well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">It&#65533;s just astonishing how easily they take to these things &#65533; I never showed her how to shut the programs down, but she figured that out; she figured out how to return to the home screens, how to tell the program she doesn&#65533;t want to save before quitting, how to double-click to launch a program. Write out a hundred times: What Children Learn From Computers Is Computers. And since practically every job in the modern world involves, if you are badly paid, punching stuff into and getting stuff out of computers, and if you are better paid, making computers do even more than they do already, learning about computers is really something. And half the battle with computers is knowing what they can do. "And when mum says that is enough for the day, I moan that there's time for just a bit more." David Farrer reckons the difference was made by TV. They live in the wildest wilds of Scotland, and they can't get it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="192">Let's allow him an elastic meaning to "going to school", and agree that if by learning to read and write "naturally", we mean children learning these things without anyone or anything laying them in front of them or making good noises about them, then indeed, children do indeed have to "go to school". We were in no position to follow up on this threat, but the kids didn't know and the thought of being stuck at home with one of us instead of at school often helped 'bring them around'. It kind of puts a new slant on the relative attractions of staying at home or going to school, doesn't it? One of the French Members of the Assemble during the debate claimed that children who did not attend school were subject to the influence of sects and that the children were at risk of being marginalized and incapable of developing an independent spirit. As Britain prepares to sign up to an EU Constitution drafted by the French and the Germans (where home-ed is almost totally illegal ), the need for vigilance by British home educators who enjoy relative freedom compared to their continental friends will become even greater. It is vitally important that Home-Ed be pushed not as the latest Omnicompetence Delusion, but merely as one version of freedom in action, with all the least-worst type disappointments that freedom involves. If Home-Ed parents do get installed as an Omnicompetent Group, and then revealed as being unworthy of such status and dethroned, and then subject to the kind of bureaucratic oversight that's now piled upon Head Teachers, then education.guadian.co.uk will in due course be running Home-Ed disaster stories similar to the story of the wretched Mr Ironmonger.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">Teachers fret &#65533; and teachers' unions pretend to fret &#65533; about what they children are "learning" from all this stuff. "I just love lessons," he said. Good for mum. Because she was the one doing it with Jack, of course. No mere school could have allowed Jack to get this far this quick. Mike worries that as home-education spreads the System will react with laws to compel attendance for all. But I can't see any government wanting to stick red-hot pokers into the lives of some of the most intellectually self-confident and mouthy people in the country.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">Might not the dream of compulsory state education for all wither away like the old USSR did, not with a bang but with hardly a whimper? Some parents educate at home through active choice, whereas for others it is a reluctant decision taken as a direct result of school-related difficulties such as school phobia / anxiety, bullying or special educational needs. I've seen children learn to read, with only the help they ask for in learning about how letters sound and what a word says, and being read to when they want to be, much later than they would have to learn in order to be accepted as 'normal' in a school. Professor Alan Thomas, of the Institute of Education at London University, complains that home schooled children can become "socially isolated". But of course, the last thing many home schooling parents worry about is that their children will miss out on the socialisation process of the average school. For many, that's the whole idea. But more interestingly, Thomas reflects on how home schooled children seem to learn.</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">What excites him is the discovery that children at home do not learn in the same way as those in school. He says they learn in fast, unpredictable bursts which are not amenable to conventional timetabling; this, he says, could bring about "the most fundamental change in our understanding of children's learning since the advent of universal schooling in the 19th century". If the lessons and benefits of home-education could be understood and taken on board by the system, fewer people might want to do it and the system might benefit. The child in kindergarten is not yet reading, but he has learned his complete alphabet now. The homeschooled child, on the other hand, surprised me by reading at an error-free fifth-grade level on the San Diego Quick Assessment test. Suddenly, it was not so hard to understand how homeschooled children, on the average, test four years ahead of their public-schooled counterparts. (The nice thing about homeschooling is that we can still observe our 5 daily prayers together) and I'll be able to teach them some history that wouldn't be available as curriculum in public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">Our public schools over here are very overcrowded and riddled with gangs, drugs and the like. I think, as an educated woman I can find many resources to enrich my children more so than the public school. These hate-crimes and incidents have targetted many school children. Parents really appreciate the option to homeschool, especially if they feel that their child is in danger. School work is all about individually getting ahead and showing promise. The complaint about home education is that it isolates children from "reality", and from the wider world, and smothers them in a protective cocoon. The right and the wrong way to teach literacy &#65533; but what exactly is the right way?</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">Lew Rockwell writes about home schooling versus school schooling, and about phonics versus whole word literacy teaching. Long-time readers may recall a column titled, " A Tale of 2 Children ," wherein I compared two 3-year old children, one of whom was being taught to read by his parents and one who was destined for public school. The two children are now 5 years old, and I recently examined their progress. I verified his competence by asking him to read selections from C.S. Lewis' "Prince Caspian" to me, a book with which he was previously unfamiliar. While he occasionally stumbled on words such as versification and centaur, (he pronounced them "versication" and "kentaur"), his comprehension was reasonably good as well. The problem with public schools and reading is not hard to grasp. Whole language, the favored method, is a disastrous approach to reading that is destined for failure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">Children who learn to read while being taught this method learn to read in spite of it, not because of it. Yes, that's how it seems to me also. Read more about the phonics method here . By the way, every time I visit a phonics site, such as the one linked to above, I look for a step-by-step description of how to teach reading in the best phonics way possible. After all, these people are adamant that there is a best way. So what exactly is it? I want to have a how-to guide to read.</paragraph><paragraph parID="199">First do this. Test it like this. Then do this. Test this like this. Then do that. Practise it like so. Reinforce it like so.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">Learn to spell this list of words. And so on. The trouble is, when I think I may have found such a guide, I either find I have to pay for it, which seems odd given that these people are trying to spread literacy and not just to make money. Or else I find myself reading yet another argument about why the method they favour is the best one, or, even more tangentially, why other methods are bad. Which is absolutely not the same thing as the best method itself. These arguments are important, and it is important that the best team wins them. But an explanation of why a method works is a quite distinct matter from the thing itself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">Can any of you phonics-persons help me? Please note that I will fisk you/it mercilessly if you merely show me yet another argument about why your particular brand of phonics works, or indeed any method which ever digresses into this related distraction. I want the thing itself, and nothing else. This must be available, to read and to link to, somewhere on the Internet. If it isn't, then it damn well ought to be. I think this is a good discussion. I like the freedoms involved in homeschooling my kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="202">I really support everyone's freedoms to do this. I happen to be a Muslim and even though I wear the headscarf, I am by no stretch an extremist. I have quite liberal views about human rights and social justice and as a Muslim I plan to give my kids more than just a religious education. In fact we'll focus on secular materials most of the time. Even though I'll be homeschooling, I will especially teach my children respect for other people's belief systems and cultures. I feel very committed to that. I think that most people, no matter what religion they are or what culture they come from, try to teach cooperation and acceptance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">Lately, there has been a lot of post September 11 backlash against the Muslim community. A couple of months ago I reported on Mean Girls , basically because I had just introduced my Gratuitous Picture policy, and this was a fine excuse for pictures. (And of course mentioning this movie again is another picture opportunity. This time I've chosen a snap of one of the boys in the movie for my lady readers.) However, quite aside from its pictorial possibilities, it seems that it is also quite a good movie . It certainly, according to 14-year-old Ellie Veryard, serves up many lessons about the joys of all that socialisation that home schooled kids miss out on. The heroine of Mean Girls was home schooled before then being school schooled.</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">And I'm guessing/hoping that if this movie does well in Britain, it will get more people thinking about home schooling, simply because home schooling is an important part of the story. Plot Summary: Raised in African bush country by her zoologist parents, Cady Heron (Lohan) thinks she knows about "survival of the fittest." But the law of the jungle takes on a whole new meaning when the home-schooled 15-year-old enters public high school for the first time and falls prey to the psychological warfare and unwritten social rules that teenage girls face today. It's the way that "home-schooled" is now a standard feature of American life, needing no explanation. I intend to check this out on video, if only to see how the whole home-schooled thing is treated. It's Mean Girls . And as is all very proper for a Hollywood movie, not many of us can remember sharing a school with girls like this :</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">Again, I've been wandering the Internet looking for pictures to decorate this. Although, perhaps this about the educational vibes of combining home working with home educating. And I reckon if I had to leave it at that, that would suffice. Put it this way. Here are two big current trends on the up: home working and home educating. Between them they reunite children with the world of work, something educators have been wanting to do ever since an earlier generation of idealistic educators finally succeeded in wrenching these two things apart from each other.</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">In the present world, where work is work and school is school, all too many children emerge from their schools with their brains reasonably well exercised by year after year of school work, but with a basic ignorance about work work and about how work work is done. That was me, definitely. I remember it distinctly. Cooperating at school verges on cheating, because the point is that you must do the school work. The point of work work is merely that the work gets done, and so long as you pull your weight in some capacity or another, you earn your pay. Work work is cooperating, and if you cooperate successfully no one expels you for cheating. No, they praise you for cooperating.</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">And the other thing that school work systematically separates you from is economic reality. The school spends money &#65533; the way it spends it. And you do your school work. The connection between work and wealth creation is severed, during a human being's most impressionable years. (One of the points I make in this Libertarian Alliance piece , of which I am very proud and which people often link to still, even though it was written a decade ago, is that children who grow up in families where money is a constant worry and a constant battle grow up systematically more economically savvy than do those children whose parents are economically more comfortable and less burdened.) It seems to me that all of these myopias are likely to be somewhat and perhaps even completely corrected if kids are educated in a home where real work work is also being done, even if the only regular message they get is that Dad is now busy and must not be disturbed, because if he is disturbed this will cost the family money. What an irony if it was actually this exact trend that reunited education with reality.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">Apologies to all home educators reading this who have known about this for years, but the thought has only just occurred to me. Home work work plus home school work anecdotes welcome. I've just got around to reading this from the BBC, about the rise in Britain of working at home. The key change has been the arrival of broadband connections for millions rather than for a few thousand. One of the big breaks on the rise of home education in Britain has surely been the rise, at about the same time, of the two-wage/two-salary family, with both parents needing to be away from home during the day, and needing old fashioned schools simply to keep an eye on their kids &#65533; even if actual education there is something of a bonus. The rise of working at home is surely, therefore, going to help home education. Anything which makes it easier for at least one parent (maybe by the two of them taking it in turns) to stay at home, as in this case, is bound to encourage it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">And before commenters tell me that there are all kinds of problems with trying to combine working with child minding, I can fully appreciate that. I didn't say it necessarily makes child minding easy; I merely say that for some parents, it makes it easi er . And it surely does. l'm thinking in particular of children who are old enough to work undisturbed for quite long periods of time (something at which home educated children often excel), but who are nevertheless too young to be left at home entirely on their own. That way, Mum or Dad can also get some serious work done. Homeschooling in the USA &#65533; it works and the politicians can't mess with it This story from last month reminds me of something Tim Evans said to me at that meeting I talked at a week ago.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">He said he'd met this American lawyer who'd been representing/lobbying for Home Schoolers in the USA, and the message was that Home Schoolers are a political force that a US politician crosses at his peril. Despite this threat, I'm optimistic about the future. There is great cause for all like-minded Americans to be optimistic. A new political force is rising up that will prove to be extremely powerful. The "vast right-wing conspiracy" is indeed growing and becoming more organized, as an unlikely group of political activists arise. Homeschoolers are a group that will soon be a force the left will have to contend with. Unfortunately, in the past, conservative organizations have always fallen short of the effectiveness of liberal groups.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">The biggest problem with conservative Christians is not their ideas, but their leadership and organization. The culture wars have been fought by highly organized liberal groups and by dozens of unorganized conservative groups lacking commitment and strength. Yet, that is changing, and homeschoolers are leading the charge. It certainly doesn't sound as if Peter Williams is going to degenerate into a vegetative state if he pursues those educational studies that he so much enjoys at home, with his parents, rather than at a school which is determined that he must fit into their routine, no matter what. One of the real benefits of homeschooling is that the student learns from the beginning that his/her education is his/her responsibility and not the responsibility of the parent/teacher. Homeschooled children are usually self-starters who are very flexible. They learn to do research, to look for information on their own, and to make good use of whatever resources are available.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">As a result, they are able to educate themselves far beyond the level of the typical public schooled child. Another is that teaching means inflaming and then encouraging and assisting the above quality, of self-starterdom. In practice that means: when they are concentrating on learning something that they have chosen to learn do not interrupt . I've had another busy day today, but I did manage to find this depressing news from Germany : A German school official has ordered seven families homeschooling their children in Northwest Germany to enroll their children in public schools immediately, or the children will be forcibly removed by police and taken to school. Any resistance on the part of the parents will result in the children being removed from their homes, according to a Home School Legal Defense Association report. The families argued that, as Christians, they wanted to protect their children from the godless and humanistic values being taught in public schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">They also assured officials that they were providing an adequate education through a German correspondence school. County education director Heinz Kohler dismissed the families' beliefs, stating, "you and your children are not living in isolation on some island but rather in an environment posing intra- and extracurricular situations where you'll have to accept that your world view will be curtailed." Kohler further explained that homeschooling could not be allowed as "children should not be encapsulated or kept apart from the outside world. In these cases, the parents' rights to personally educate their children would prevent the children from growing up to be responsible individuals within society&#65533;" You will be socialised! I found this at an American anti-abortion site. Americans can contemplate this kind of thing with relative detachment, but here in Britain, for anyone who favours the right to homeschool, it is different.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">Homeschoolers here must have in the back of their minds the thought that the EU might one day decide to "harmonise" the rules about homeschooling, and something tells me they probably wouldn't harmonise them in such a way that Germans would be allowed to homeschool. I interrupt my Christmas holidays with news of Peter Williams, and of the battle that his parents are embroiled in with Hampshire LEA. Who is Peter Williams? Well, among other things, he is a chess champion : A seven-year-old chess champion has been pulled out of school by his parents after a row over skipping lessons to practise the game. Peter and Carol Williams decided to teach their son Peter at home in Alton, Hampshire, after the local education authority refused to give him time off for training sessions. Peter's school, St Lawrence Primary in Alton, had blocked a request to give him a day off every week to play chess.</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">Peter has dazzled experts with his talent for chess since the age of five - beating scores of older children and adults. Most recently, the prodigy won the top prizes of &#65533;100 and &#65533;120 respectively in the Central London Adult Rapid Play and Adult Long Play championships. He has also won several junior tournaments, including the mini squad under-nines championships last year. Peter said on Tuesday: "I like the money and the trophies. I want to be the best." His father added: "Peter is the best chess player of his age in the country. "We just want him to have the very best chance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">"We wanted him to have time to study and, as children of his age learn best in the morning, we wanted to take him out of school one day a week. "But the school and the local education authority were treating it as truancy. Mr Williams said he expected Peter will remain out of school until he is old enough to go to secondary school, where he hopes the timetable will be more flexible. Peter is a great Harry Potter fan, and often believes he is a magician himself when facing a chessboard. Peter smiles and tells me cheekily he plays because "you can make loads of money". So what else do you enjoy other than chess and reading Harry Potter? "That's easy, educational studies," came back the reply.</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">Both of those reports are somewhat out of date, the first one dating from the summer of 2003. to Sean Gabb's recent piece entitled Home Schooling: A British Perspective , but better late than never. (Only very recently has our Royal Family not home schooled.) He makes the point that estimating the exact number of people involved in home schooling in Britain is difficult, because these are not people who volunteer details of their child rearing arrangements with the kind of people who do research into such things. He itemises and expands upon the various reasons why people choose to home school, under the three headings of: discipline and safety, curriculum and quality of instruction, and religious and ideological dissent. He describes the slow build-up among the meddling classes of the desire to meddle in and evntually to expunge home schooling, which is particularly strong in Scotland, and, given that there don't seem to be many harmful educational effects from home schooling, Sean speculates about other motives for this meddlesomeness, mainly, he suggests, ideological. There can be no doubt that - whatever may be the numbers overall - the number of children educated at home has increased and is increasing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">During the next few years, it is also at least reasonable to believe that there will be a debate over whether the numbers ought to be diminished. On the one side will be the supporters of an activist state, divided as to their motivation, but united in their belief that education should be supervised by the authorities. On the other will be the home schooling parents. Those who are visible can be expected to fight all efforts at regulation with a passion not seen in British politics within living memory. We may, then, be returning to something like the debates of the middle and late Victorian years, when education was considered more than just a matter of funding and standards. Here are two more reports, about how home schooling is on the up and up, in Scotland : The latest figures produced by the Scottish Executive show there were 480 children educated outside school in Scotland, who were known to the authorities, in 2002/03.</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">The number represents a 38% increase compared with 2000/01, when there were 349 children in the same category. Over the past five years, the number of children excluded from Scottish schools for violent behaviour has increased by almost 18%. A study of young people in Glasgow last June revealed that 20% of young boys, including primary children, carried knives to protect themselves. A spokeswoman for the Home Education Advisory Service (HEAS), told Scotland on Sunday: "The most common reason which people give us for considering home education is fear of violence and bullying at school. They fear that their learning is being disrupted, and that it&#65533;s making their lives miserable. "Many fear that the system is unable to cope and keep the small number of children who cause problems from ruining it for the rest of them. In Florida, the number of home-school students has nearly tripled over the past ten years.</paragraph><paragraph parID="220">Nationally, the United States Department of Education says the number has swelled to more than a million kids. Oregon researcher Brian Ray, of the National Home Education Research Institute, estimates two million kids are now taught at home. "In the last four years, we think home schooling has grown at least 30 percent," says Ray. "Study after study, many of which I've done, have shown that home-schooled children are well above average &#65533; 15 to 30 percentile points above on standardized achievement tests." Ray points to last year's first and second place winners of the National Spelling Bee &#65533; both home-schooled. And now even Harvard University says it accepts home-schooled applicants. Sir, I'm a 15-year-old, home-educated student and for me, leaving school was one of the best things I've done.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">I left about a year ago, thoroughly miserable after being bullied for three years and after various meetings with teachers about it, which achieved nothing. I am now doing a correspondence course. Contrary to the popular belief, it is actually quite easy to make new friends outside of school. I've kept in touch with one friend from school and I play the violin, so I go to an orchestra every Saturday, where I've met new friends. I'm also a member of " Education otherwise", which is a home-ed organisation, where I write to various pen-pals. How sociable is school anyway? You have all your cliques, but if you don't fit in you can be ostracised.</paragraph><paragraph parID="222">Yours faithfully, DANIELLE SHANKS, 56 Vaux Crescent, Walton on Thames, Surrey KT12 4HD. Bryanna Rosenblatt says her public school friends envy her, because they all think she's home in her pajamas all day. But she keeps herself on a regular routine: up, showered and dressed by 8 a.m., tackling a curriculum of her own design. Home-schoolers who don't correspond with online high schools are creative in how they document what they do, so that they can demonstrate to school districts - and later to colleges - what they are learning. Many are diligent in logging daily activities, with each tallied in a different column. And they must be, almost by definition, among the most intellectually self-confident people around. I believe the system is a brutal failure, but parents must decide for themselves.</paragraph><paragraph parID="223">New Jersey's child welfare system, like most state child welfare systems, is a corrupt and deadly mess. Children are lost in the shuffle, shipped to abusive foster homes, returned to rapists and child molesters, and left to die in closets while paperwork piles up. So whom does the government decide to punish for the bureaucracy's abysmal failure to protect these innocents? A crackdown on innocent homeschooling families to cure the incompetence of government child welfare agencies is like a smoker lopping off his ear to treat metastatic lung cancer. Cyber and homeschooling charter schools have suddenly become a prominent part of the charter school movement. Such schools differ from conventional schools by delivering much of their curriculum and instruction through the use of the internet and minimizing the use of personnel and physical facilities. This paper examines how these alternative charter school models are emerging within the larger public school and charter school communities with particular attention to recent developments in California and Pennsylvania .</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">In these two states public scrutiny of cyber and homeschooling charter schools has led to considerable debate and demands for public accountability. Of particular concern is the need to modify the regulatory framework to accommodate cyber and homeschooling charter schools as well as consideration of the differing financial allocations that are appropriate for schools that operate with reduced personnel and facilities and the division of financial responsibility between state and local educational agencies. It is no exaggeration to say that the Internet could be the difference between home-schooling becoming an ever bigger and more significant movement, and being wiped out by its implacable state-education-equals-education enemies. However, after much discussion it is clear that school is no longer beneficial, and she is becoming increasingly stressed and upset in that environment. A system of education that treats children as an undifferentiated mass will either end up wasting huge amounts of time in teaching subjects at too early an age, or will deprive children of knowledge they should already have acquired. One of the lessons of home education is that full time formal education for children is largely a waste of time. Most obviously we lost acquaintance with other children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">By the time I was ten I was used to adults taking me seriously but was only on tentative speaking terms with boys and girls of my own age. Add to that the new nationwide standards &#65533; uniform curriculum and more testing &#65533; which some educators say penalize children with special needs, whether they are gifted, learning disabled or merely eccentric. More women are abandoning careers to stay home with their children. And many families yearn for a less frantic schedule and more time together. How easy is it in the UK to switch to homeschooling and do GCSEs from home? I am unsure of the regulations in the UK, maybe you could tell me: can she be homeschooled for the last six months before her GCSEs? Although dressed up as places of learning, the primary function of schools, especially government schools, is child minding &#65533; keeping children off the streets while their parents do other things.</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">Far from efficient teaching and shorter school hours being a desirable goal, it is probably the last thing most parents want. Some time afterwards Hephzibah attended this same school for a whole five days, at the end of which the superintendent asked for a private interview with my parents to tell them their daughter was backward; whereupon Hephzibah too was whisked home and within the year fluently read and wrote. The academic gains and losses of the system are harder to weigh. If we didn't take mathematics beyond the beginnings of algebra and geometry, nor even study physics or chemistry, nor learn Latin and Greek, I believe that the languages and literature we did concentrate on were taken beyond the levels offered by most schools. They come to home schooling fed up with the shortcomings of public education and the cost of private schools. "The presumption of home schooling is that children's distinctive needs come before the managerial needs of the schools," he said. In addition to dissatisfaction with schools, Mr. Stevens and others say, social trends have fed interest in home schooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="227">Theirs is a post-1960s America, a nation now sensitized profoundly to the fact that state officials and school bureaucrats can abuse their powers, a nation that has grown rather more accustomed than it used to be to groups that do things unconventionally, to people who live their ideals. At the end of the second, we find Jeremy saying, of a computerised home schooling set-up of some kind that the regular teachers somewhere or other in America are getting angry about: This new model may be bad for teachers, but what about kids? I didn't really understand Stephen's logic a couple of weeks ago when he said that homeschooling was a bad idea because many parents are not qualified to teach. The idea that none should be allowed to because some can't do it well seems a bit absurd, and the public system is in the midst of trying to figure out what it means to get "qualified teachers" when funding keeps getting cut and districts face teacher shortages . And what if they had good curriculum to use with their kids, online collaboration tools and all kinds of extra-curricular social activities available - sports, clubs, friends, travel, etc - wouldn't that have the potential to be an excellent learning experience? PARENTS who take their children out of school have been accused of "kidding themselves" they can educate their children from the kitchen table.</paragraph><paragraph parID="228">In a hard-hitting statement a teaching union leader claimed home educators are jeopardising their children&#65533;s future. And, in a separate attack, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council (SPTC) has accused ministers of putting children at risk of abuse and poor teaching by agreeing to cut down checks on those who are not enrolled at school. Yesterday, Pat O&#65533; Donnell, a Scottish official of the NASUWT teaching union, insisted that the Executive should adopt a strong line on home education. He said: "Gone are the days when well-educated parents could do at home what teachers do at school. They&#65533;re kidding themselves they can educate their children from the kitchen table. "This is a movement driven by romantic anti-establishment views of the world." Ronnie Smith, the general secretary of the EIS, Scotland&#65533;s main teaching union, said school allows children to interact with peers and teachers, which plays a major part in pupils&#65533; social development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="229">But Alison Sauer, of the home schooling group Education Otherwise, rejected the criticism. She said: "If you are a professional teacher you don&#65533;t know what you are talking about when it comes to home education. We don&#65533;t do any teaching. Our philosophy is self-directed learning. "They can say what they like until they are blue in the face but the evidence shows that home education is the most brilliant thing." After two failed appeals two years ago, we were forced to send our daughter to a school we did not want. Despite support from us, our bright daughter is bored at school, and we can do nothing about falling standards and discipline issues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="230">We now have a second child at the same school, and she is disliking it intensely. We cannot afford private school fees. All the better state schools are full. We are aware we may be curtailing our children&#65533;s future if we leave them where they are. You have no alternative &#65533; other than to educate your children at home. If you do not feel able to take this radical step there is nonetheless a great deal you can do to support your children. Encourage them to read as much as possible, offer them varied educational experiences after school and in the holidays, and, if you can afford it, employ a private tutor.</paragraph><paragraph parID="231">You do not have to be a qualified teacher to educate your child at home. Any parent dissatisfied with formal schooling can take responsibility for their child&#65533;s education, and growing numbers are. The state won't help parents who want to teach their children at home, so parents have pooled resources to help themselves. The state regarding something as rather bad, but not bad enough to be actually illegal, is the ideal arrangement to ensure that this something flourishes. Just think how much better school schooling would be if the government stopped trying to help with that also. Home schooling is not easy, but it is expanding all the time, with more and more resources and advice, both legal and educational, being made available to help it along, and I mean really help it along. "People get a false impression of the type of family that educates at home &#65533; they imagine they allow their children to loll around all day, doing nothing apart from the occasional piece of arts or crafts work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">In fact, many families work to a rigid timetable, geared to academic success. Some, particularly in London, withdraw their children for extended periods to give a quick spurt to learning because they are progressing so slowly at school." Personally, I still think that even this sort of home school is an improvement over children being just dumped unthinkingly at school school. But isn't it a huge risk to meddle with your child's education in this way? We all know smart people who would make better teachers than many of the ones that the government says are qualified. Olivia Daly of Leeds said: We feel we have nowhere to turn.</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">What can we do? Woodhead's reply: Sadly, you find yourselves in the position of many parents. I appreciate this is a far from ideal solution but until standards in state schools are lifted nothing else is possible. Government "help" is the kiss of death to any activity. It means that eyes are taken off the ball (in the form of doing it yourself with likeminded collaborators) and fixed instead on politics (in the form of trying to get hold of government money). Home schooling grows in popularity and credibility</paragraph><paragraph parID="234">The article makes the point, though, that having only one parent at work is usually a precondition. One way or another, the parents are taking back control of their children's education from the wider culture, which has been failing them both so badly, for so long. Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids. In fact their primary purpose is to keep kids all locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done. Many children are living pretty much the life they want, given the choices they now have, which explains why quite a lot of officially compulsory schools are actually quite nice places, instead of being run by the nastiest psychos in them. (In particular, many children would surely be horrified if obliged to stay at home and be mucked about by their parents. Freedom and home schooling are absolutely not the same thing, however large the overlap may often be.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="235">I don't know how much encouragement it has given to home schooling over the years, but this piece will definitely help. Lots of homeschooling blogs have already referenced it, and really that's my point. There's no doubt that homeschooling in the USA is on the up-and-up. Teach your children well &#65533; at home Do teachers expect too little? Not surprisingly, a lot of black parents are now moving to home schooling. And because home schooling is a much bigger thing in the USA than it is here, yet, black home schooling is becoming very big there.</paragraph><paragraph parID="236">Venus and Serena Williams are perhaps the most famous among those who call home their alma mater. The tennis stars were educated at home after their father withdrew the pair from middle school to teach them himself. The Williams family has become a visible part of a phenomenon that can be seen across the nation &#65533; an increase in the number of black families who are choosing to homeschool. Homeschooling has come a long way since it first came on the scene more than 30 years ago. In fact, homeschooling has become a viable education option for families across the country and has seen a 4,000 percent increase in 20 years. The fastest growing demographic of homeschoolers is the number of families, where black children are five times more likely to be homeschooled than they were five years ago. There&#65533;s really a shift in the African-American community,&#65533; said Jennifer James, a homeschooling mother in Chapel Hill, N.C., who founded the National African American Homeschoolers Alliance in January.</paragraph><paragraph parID="237">"Parents are taking hold of their child&#65533;s education. As I say, the real story here is surely black do-it-yourself education rather than merely black home education. Let's home that in a couple of decades time the question will be at least, and at last, moving towards: Who should get the credit for black education in the USA? I'm reminded of an essay by Paul Graham about school society. It's ostensibly about why smarter than average kids are unpopular at school, but it touches upon some deeper truths about what school is really like. Public school teachers are in much the same position as prison wardens. Wardens' main concern is to keep the prisoners on the premises.</paragraph><paragraph parID="238">They also need to keep them fed, and as far as possible prevent them from killing one another. Beyond that, they want to have as little to do with the prisoners as possible, so they leave them to create whatever social organization they want. And as for the schools, they were just holding pens within this fake world. Besides which: what happens during the school holidays. Kids are sent off to spend six years memorizing meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run after an oblong brown ball, as if this were the most natural thing in the world. It seems to me that any curriculum, no matter what combination of activities it contains, will be meaningless and stultifying to many children. The idea that you can solve the problem of a compulsory curriculum by having a different compulsory curriculum is to concentrate on tinkering with the wrong half of that phrase.</paragraph><paragraph parID="239">(The trouble with "progressive" education is that it grants the child every freedom imaginable, except the freedom to go somewhere else if the child thinks it's horrible or a waste of time. To make a more general point, many regular readers of this blog may be puzzled by the way I oscillate between arguing for children's liberation, as in this post, and quite polite discussions of this or that school or teaching method, often of a highly disciplined and "structured" sort, for example as done in the British Army , or as might be involved in them being sent away to a school in Romania . And I believe in good teaching, which can most definitely involve highly structured teaching. Practically any half-decent teacher is welcomed by some children, and is simultaneously experienced as a tyrant by other children who are forced to submit to that teacher against their will. Hence (a) my unswerving belief in freedom for children, combined with (b) my eagerness to discuss sympathetically the work of many apparently "compulsory" teachers and teaching systems now. Graham, it seems to me, is honest enough to see what many schools really are and what many schools really do, but he draws back from the conclusion that, it seems to me, ought to follow. Arran Fernandez surprised educationalists two years ago by passing a GCSE aged five.</paragraph><paragraph parID="240">Yesterday, he was celebrating again after becoming the youngest person to get an A* grade in the exam. "Homeschooling is more like college than a public or a private school is," said Cassandra, who lives with her mother in Southbury. I think homeschooling will continue to outperform the state and even private school alternatives by any measures you care to dream up, provided the comparisons they make are half way fair. It seems that when the state and its regime of forcible compulsion is absent, children who enjoy their self-directed, self-paced learning in a nurturing and supportive family environment can actually make progress in learning the kind of challenging and comprehensive academic material that has driven highly stressed Japanese school-children to committing suicide in that nation's high-pressure state-run school system. The Surrey schoolboy was seven when he took the higher-tier GCSE maths paper and topped this GCSE roll-call of young achievers after scoring the highest possible grade. Like 12-year-old Jonathan Prior, who last week became the youngest person to pass an A-level this year, Arran, now eight, does not attend school but is taught at home by his father, Neil Fernandez. Arran said: "I'm very proud of myself and so are my family and friends."</paragraph><paragraph parID="241">But he added that he planned to take a break from exams and would not move straight on to A-levels in 2004. "I study English and French and also I'm studying geography and astronomy," he said. "Daddy doesn't think I should go to school. We've done topics that aren't in the syllabus, such as complex numbers and groups." Sounds like Daddy, who sounds like an interesting guy, has a point. And note the telling little detail "and friends". Home schooled children are often accused of not being able to make those.</paragraph><paragraph parID="242">Incidentally, school is not the only arena to display ranking slippage. He feels that the Taiwanese government has been favorable toward homeschooling families because of the commitment of the homeschool movement to work with the government in a peaceable and respectful fashion. He also reports that the media has given homeschooling positive coverage, both because of the academic and social success of the children, as well as the additional time homeschooling parents are able to spend with their children. A father was recently denied his right to homeschool because of his lack of higher education. Fortunately, this denial was reversed after the Chinese Christian Home Educators Association sent a prayer alert throughout the island. Taiwanese homeschoolers have expressed thanks to the pioneer homeschooling families in the United States who have successfully homeschooled their children. Statistics from the U.S. have enabled the Taiwan homeschoolers to deal with the government and convince officials of the value of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="243">One of the greatest needs facing homeschoolers in Taiwan is the need for higher education opportunities. Because the homeschool movement in Taiwan is relatively young, few homeschool graduates have sought admission to Taiwan's colleges. As a result, most higher education institutions have not developed policies that are favorable to homeschoolers. Most homeschool graduates are then forced to seek admission to a college in the U.S. or some other country that is more favorable to homeschoolers. Please pray for Taiwan homeschoolers as they continue to expand public and legal recognition of homeschooling. Cassandra Stevenson isn't old enough to drive or vote, but she's already a college graduate. Five years ago Cassandra, now 15, entered her freshman year at Danbury's Western Connecticut State University before most of her contemporaries had hit middle school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="244">She and her older sister, Samantha, who at 19 has a master's degree in astrophysics from Wesleyan University in Middletown, never went to high school -- or elementary school for that matter. Like a small but growing number of Connecticut youngsters, they were homeschooled. No wonder homeschooling is spreading. Cassandra attributes her academic achievements to the home instruction her mother, Deborah Stevenson, provided around the family dining room table. "You learn what you want to learn and what you need to learn. The curriculum is fitted to you." While off-the-charts success stories like Cassandra and Samantha's are relatively rare, a National Home Education Research Institute study showed that the majority of home-educated children score at or above the 80th percentile on statewide standardized tests.</paragraph><paragraph parID="245">Such statistics may account for why the number of home-educated children in Connecticut has increased six-fold since 1990. Despite such gains, only about 2,100 of the state's about 630,000 school-age children are being educated at home, according to data provided by the state Department of Education. About 250 Fairfield County youngsters are homeschooled, the state Department of Education's Student Census Report shows. The statewide increase is part of a larger national trend, said William Lloyd, a researcher for the home education institute who estimates that last year about 2.1 million children were homeschooled &#65533; up from 500,000 in 1990. What all of the above means is that in the short run, homeschooling is going to grow and grow, to the point where homeschoolers will exist in such numbers that their abolition, or even their excessive harrassment, will become a political impossibility. For as long as homeschooling is done by mums like the mum of Cassandra and Samantha, it's pretty much bound to do really well. That at any rate will the retrospective put-down from the critics.</paragraph><paragraph parID="246">But what if Mrs Typical Homeschooler starts to be Joanne Schmo rather than Alberta Einstein? After all, being well educated means learning how to find out about things that your teachers have no idea about. The issue I really want to focus on, though, is the level of acceptance that bullying, teasing and related behaviors that demonstrate poor character are 1) expected 2) normal and 3) demand early and repeated exposure to by our youngest citizens. Public schools are in a unique situation. They provide an ever increasing program of diversity training while at the same time tolerating a high level of teasing and bullying. At the same time, talk to almost any educator or parent who has (or has been) a child of the system, and you will hear version after version of "kids will be kids". The transalation is "You can't stop all teasing, you need to accept that it's going to happen."</paragraph><paragraph parID="247">The fact that teasing and bullying happens at schools is given as an argument that our children *should* attend. So &#65533; to sum up my poorly communicated incredulity: teasing and bullying happens. But we will honor our children's needs to behave as they do in under-supervised packs. And not only is this a good thing, you need to throw your children into the mix at an early age. Children as young as 10 are being robbed of their childhood by pressure to copy scantily clad pop stars such as Kylie Minogue, the leader of a teaching union said yesterday. And I can tell you that the home-thinged children whom I've been getting to know (a) get "pressure" from their parents that is much less frantic and antagonistic, to the point where it hardly seems like pressure at all, because the matter is settled between the children and the parents, day in day out, without third parties piling in with other agendas for six hours every day, and (b) they don't get pressure from feral-gang peer groups. They do, however, (c) go out and make friends as and when they feel the need.</paragraph><paragraph parID="248">The idea that home-schooled children don't know how to socialise is, in my experience of socialising with them and on the basis of what they say about their lives, tosh. The difference is that the very lives of these children are not ruled by the aggregate of their friends' opinions. Home education is a perfectly legal form of educational provision in the UK; furthermore, it is always a parent's responsibility to make sure that their child receives a suitable education. Yes, I've read that before, but it can't be said too often. Home education is open to all parents, whatever their race, creed, income, social class or level of education. - You don't have to have any teaching qualifications. - You don't have to follow the National Curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="249">- You don't have to keep to school hours, days or terms. - You don't have to give formal, school-type lessons - You don't need to use a timetable. - Your child will not take Key Stage tests (SATs) "First of all they have to like them, enjoy their company ... enjoy all their talk and questions ... have enough confidence in themselves, scepticism about experts, and willingness to be different from most people &#65533;" (Holt p. 38) I preferred the earlier stuff, the bit about what you didn't have to do. From my contact with homeschooling parents, it was not unusual for children who enjoyed their self-directed, self-paced learning in a pressure-free environment, to freely choose to struggle and learn extremely challenging, rigorous and even comprehensive academic material that was of interest to them. This was especially the case when the material was arranged to begin with the basics, then progress in a very logical sequence to higher levels of complexity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="250">All one parent did was to provide encouragement, reassurance and emotional support as her child freely chose to struggle through such material, which came packaged in a series of CD-rom discs, VCR's and work books. Yet state education bureaucrats in several North American school districts remain adamantly hostile to the concept of homeschooling, harassing and victimizing homeschooling parents, even arresting and laying truancy charges against homeschooled teenagers. Home schooling is apparently being talked about up there in the same breath as Fred West, mass murderer. So, the question is, will the critics of home schooling succeed in persuading Scotland that home schoolers are mad, or will the critics of home schooling persuade Scotland that they, the critics of home schooling, are the mad ones? Aaron was talking to a friend on the phone, "I just finished washing my parents' car," he said. His friend asked if he was getting money for doing it. Aaron said, "No, I just like doing it - I like doing car and bike work .... basically I'm the little work ant of the family."</paragraph><paragraph parID="251">Good description - he's always doing something ... he doesn't care for reading or writing but compensates in so many ways. I'm glad he's learning a good delight-driven work ethic rather than having paperwork forced on him in the public schools. Last week I dined with some home schoolers. They are, after all, home schooling their children, not protecting them from schooling as such. The Internet features prominently, as the means by which parents can obtain educational materials, and of course it is also one of the ways that parents learn about the home schooling option in the first place. But what the piece also illustrates is just one of the many ways in which a school can be deeply unsatisfactory, and thus home schooling loom larger as a preferred option. It's linked to by Glenn Reynolds here , to illustrate how easy it is now to educate yourself, wherever you are.</paragraph><paragraph parID="252">It's the same observation as the one about why homeschooling works so much better now than it used to. The average home is now better informed than even the best university a couple of generations ago. In some ways the French system of education appears to be in worse shape than the British one. But the real problem is that there is no "unofficial" system of education that remotely resembles the unofficial sector in Britain. The French system of education seems to suffer from all the same difficulties as the British one of falling academic standards and declining standards of behaviour, and from all the same worries caused by wanting to combine social inclusiveness with keeping order in the only way that order can actually be kept, which is by excluding some children. Teachers are civil servants with jobs for life, which probably makes bad ones even harder to avoid than in Britain. The fundamental difference is that the French system lacks the self-corrective balance supplied by educational mavericks simply being allowed to do their own thing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="253">This private sector seems to be quite good, but of course it is expensive, and that vital power to simply remove your kid altogether from any school is unavailable. But as the practice of home education and home schools spreads in Anglo-Saxonia, as it is spreading and surely will spread more, it is likely to result in huge educational improvements, which could in the longer run leave continental Europe as far behind educationally as it already is in things like computer making and computer programming. I remember discussing with them how any government which took on the home-schoolers of Britain would have got itself the Political Enemies from Hell. Consider the fact that many home-schoolers have considerable demonstrating experience. So, no, I rather suspect that education otherwise will remain a legal fixture in Britain for some time to come, and that this difference between Anglo-Saxonia and the continent will continue to be a fact, and a fact of great significance. I briefly met the two daughters (aged 8 and 5), who seemed to be happy, confident, well educated people. Whatever is being done, something is being done right.</paragraph><paragraph parID="254">The first concerns the motivation of this couple in opting for home schooling. They did not opt and are not opting for home schooling out of any radical or ideologically-based disapproval of the principle of schooling as such. What they are protecting their children from is what they believe to be bad schooling. It began as a one-off holding operation in response to one especially neglectful teacher, and has continued because it seems to be working okay, and because other better alternatives still do not seem to be available. They had a very traditional idea of what "good" education ought to consist of, and they felt that they could supply this better at home than any available school now could. The local state school seemed to be bad in all the ways you would expect, such as discipline, unambitious curriculum, and so on. And what they particularly didn't like was that had they gone there, their girls would have had to work too hard , doing solidly academic stuff not only all the morning, but for most afternoons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="255">These girls get solidly schooled by mum all through the morning, but after lunch their time is their own. Getting into the habit of spending long hours keeping themselves interested seemed also to have developed their powers of concentration. The second especially interesting thing I was told was that the girls seemed to be much happier with their own company than did their regularly schooled friends. Partly this was because, they said, they weren't being driven too hard, and wer being allowed to grow intellectually at their own pace. But there was also, she said, none of the "I'm bored" stuff that other parents got from their kids during the school holidays. In other words, what I found was a family which believed in our old friend, a broad-based "humanities" education &#65533; a liberal education in the old fashioned sense. These people agreed with Sean Gabb about what education should consist of and what kinds of virtues and insights it should inculcate, and home schooling was their way to achieve this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="256">But, inevitably, the "socialisation" objection to home schooling is also raised. With the resources of the internet it is easy to replicate classroom work at home, but harder to provide the teamwork and playground games, the fallings-out and makings-up, that are as essential to a child's growth as mental maths and basic literacy. Some home schooling, and some regular schooling. Look west and you will find a primary school in Devon that takes one child in for two days a week, and another for three, under an agreement with their parents that the rest of the children's education will be at home. The head's view is that half a week in school is better than none, and that it works if everyone co-operates. But, as any home schoolers reading this will not need to be told, it is precisely the "socialisation" offered by many schools that they are often anxious to avoid. The kinder, gentler rhythms of family life are not merely preferred on narrowly education grounds, but precisely because it provides a superior sort of socialisation, in the form of a more gradual easing of children in to the wider world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="257">Children as young as four are being traumatised by a regime of formal school instruction in the Three Rs that has turned early learning into a straitjacket, teachers said yesterday. They were not ready to accept regimented lessons at four. They called for the formal school starting age to be put back to six, as it is in most European countries. They provide a softer social landing for children in the transition between home and school. All that actually happens is that their socialisation is messed up, in other words it is exactly where schools are supposed to be superior to home schooling that such regular schools actually fall down. The more familiar form in which regular school "socialisation" is so often found wanting is that schools are too full of bullying not, as in the above case, by teachers of tiny pupils, but of pupils (and teachers) by other pupils. That just may be somewhat of an exaggeration, but it makes the point yet again that many schools are, precisely in their "socialisation" effects, deeply unsatisfactory places.</paragraph><paragraph parID="258">Children don't have to go to school to learn to walk, talk, recognize objects, or remember the personalities of their friends, even though these tasks are much harder than reading, adding, or remembering dates in history. They do have to go to school to learn written language, arithmetic, and science, because those bodies of knowledge and skill were invented too recently for any species-wide knack for them to have evolved. Stick a clutch of babies on a desert island with lots of food and drink readily available, and come back in ten years time. By then they will have their own language, crude yet effective, and they'll be speaking it fluently and grammatically. What they will not be doing is reading or writing in it, because that is not "natural". It is in the nature of children &#65533; little children especially &#65533; to pay attention to adults and to copy them and to learn from them and even to hero worship them, their parents especially of course. It is in the nature of children to tune in to the culture around them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="259">And all of that means that going to "school" is only one of several ways to learn to read and write, and not necessarily the best one by any means. Surrounded by a world with words everywhere, where people get around by reading signs and know what to buy by reading the labels on packages and where the information from the words on the video games helps to play the game and where people enjoy reading books and newspapers and magazines, learning to read as one is interested in learning it happens. Having someone to read things to them, when they can't read it for their self (books, games etc), to ask if this letter makes what sound, to think up and play games about letters/words with when the interest is there- helping a child learn in ways that are interesting to them- I think that is the way to 'teach' reading. Once governments seize control of children at the beginning of their learning-to-talk period rather than at the end of it, as they are now starting to do, multi-lingualism will then become a most tremendous problem, and fifteen per cent of the population (including most particularly those who have been confused by the government in more than one language) will grow up unable to utter a single word and in a state of intellectual malformation such as we can now only guess at. I always felt that schools were a wretched way to educate. Even the best schools tend to bore their pupils half to death, teaching irrelevant nonsense, badly (and I was lucky &#65533; I went to one of the &#65533;best&#65533; schools in the country). But as time has passed, I&#65533;ve begun to appreciate more and more one of the indirect benefits of home education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="260">I&#65533;m almost embarrassed to admit it, but for me the fact that we control what goes into our children&#65533;s minds is a very big plus. There&#65533;s always the risk that when they are older they will resent me for it, but I&#65533;d rather our children learned their values at home than from the knowing pre-teens who inhabit the modern school playground. By "easier" I don't mean that British children are genetically predisposed to learning at home. I mean that the State puts very few obstacles in the way of British home educators. Here, if you want to home educate your children, you just do it. There are no forms to fill out. You don't need to get permission from anybody.</paragraph><paragraph parID="261">You may get the occasional visit from the Local Education Authority, but that's rarely a problem. You don't need to follow any particular curriculum (or any curriculum at all). If your children have never been to school then you don't even have to tell the authorities you're doing it. And as that happens, the pressure will grow for the State to "do something" about "the problem" of home education. It will come from the Press (all it will take is one scare story about a home educated ten year old who hasn't yet learned to read). That's the point at which home education will become a major libertarian issue in the U.K. A while ago I did a posting saying that I was in favour of Muslims having the right to home-school , on the grounds that Muslim families are less likely to be Islamofascists than Muslim schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="262">The Saleem family is part of a small but growing number of American Muslims opting to teach their children at home. As do home schoolers of other faiths, Ms. Saleem says teaching her children herself ensures they absorb a strong religious identity. But since Sept. 11, she says, a newer set of fears is pushing Muslim parents toward home-schooling: Concerns about their children's safety in public schools and, on the flip side, the possibility that they'll be exposed to extremist views in private Islamic schools. "Any of our children can get caught in someone's rhetoric." It's not just that these good people are in my opinion less likely to be Islamofascists than the people running Muslim schools. Meanwhile the presumption of liberty did me proud, and I said the right thing anyway. So it is with extreme pleasure that I introduce the first of what I hope will be many contributions to this blog by Julius Blumfeld .</paragraph><paragraph parID="263">"But what will you do about socialization?" It turns out that we were wrong. It's not like learning a second language. Now we tell people that you'd have to keep a child locked in a room for ten years for it not to become 'socialized'. There is an interesting story in the latest TES (that link is to the publication website but not to the piece itself), under the headline "Congestion fee forces teachers to quit jobs" (TES Jan 10 2003 page 12): In general, I suspect that one of the reasons why homeschooling may be growing in popularity in Britain is that our transport system is becoming ever more shambolic and clogged up. This topic was briefly mentioned in the discussion that followed my talk last Friday , but the general notion that homeschooling is an economic as well as just an educational phenomenon (which I had hoped to talk about) didn't really get much of a mention.</paragraph><paragraph parID="264">But it surely isn't just that the schools themselves that are a problem; there is also the increasingly fraught battle to get the kids to school every day. I regard modern mass education as an economically ridiculous arrangement, never mind how nasty and mind-dumbing it is. Why on earth do schools have to be so big, and as a direct result, so far away from most of their "customers"? Why can't children, especially younger ones, just gather in someone's front room to learn things? Michael Peach , who, by the way, has moved to Movable Type, reproduces the full text of a press release from Schoolhouse , the Scottish homeschooling group. According to the results of a New Year poll, 30% of parents would home educate their children, which is hardly surprising when we consider research findings which demonstrate the superiority of free range learning compared to the factory schooling model. Homeschoolers tend to be rather intellectual types, not given to instructing children in the delights of violent physical activity, or so I guess.</paragraph><paragraph parID="265">There's recently been a row buzzing along in the USA about whether homeschooled children should be entitled to participate in school sports teams. However, what homeschooled children clearly should be allowed to do is apply for membership of sports teams/clubs/classes that are happy to welcome them. If they wanted out, then out they could go, with no blots on their copybooks or markings-down on their CVs. Accreditation does nothing to measure a student's knowledge or what he was taught, it only reflects where he was taught. Homeschoolers are not drop-outs, but talented, conscientious students who have completed their high school education. If a transcript is required, colleges should have flexible guidelines for records and documentation of the basic credit hours for high school completion. Some colleges supply homeschoolers with a "Homeschool Credit Evaluation Form" that may be completed in lieu of a transcript.</paragraph><paragraph parID="266">As the primary instructors, parents should be recognized as capable of evaluating their student's academic competence in letters of recommendation. SAT/ACT scores and portfolios or performance-based assessments provide schools with a solid basis for admission. Like most colleges, the University of Missouri-Columbia relies heavily on test results and the dozen or so homeschoolers they have in every freshman class "tend to have excellent test score results." In addition, UMC emphasized that a GPA is "not a factor in admitting homeschoolers." Mandatory SAT II testing in specific subjects is an unnecessary roadblock. Requiring only homeschool students to take these tests, in addition to the SAT, is discriminatory. Colleges will discourage homeschoolers from seeking admission by holding them to this unreasonable standard.</paragraph><paragraph parID="267">SAT/ACT testing is more than enough to indicate the academic proficiency of the student. A bibliography of high school literature and an essay are two admission criteria, which accurately evaluate a student's life experience and thinking skills. "These homeschoolers write fabulous essays!" Interviews and a review of extracurricular activities are two ways to determine overall student proficiency and leadership qualities. HSLDA hopes that it assists college admission offices in adopting reasonable policies for homeschool applicants, taking into account their unique circumstances and talents. Many Christian colleges are eager to obtain more homeschool applicants because they find the homeschooled student generally has a strong Christian foundation and excels academically. The average homeschooler had an ACT score of 24 and an SAT score of 1005, consistent with the average score for all ORU students, but higher than the national average.</paragraph><paragraph parID="268">Mitchell&#146;s report also found that the average ORU homeschooler&#146;s GPA was 3.02, while the overall average ORU student&#146;s GPA was 2.76. Mitchell reported that 88 percent of ORU homeschooled students were involved in one or more outreach ministries. Many served as chaplains in the dorms and virtually all embraced the ORU honor code as an already adopted way of life. In addition, over 90 percent of ORU homeschoolers participated in intramural sports and nearly 80 percent in various campus clubs and organizations. Homeschoolers were active in all areas of college life, debunking the myth that homeschoolers are largely unsocialized. On October 10, 1997, Drs. Rhonda Galloway and Joe Sutton released the results of a four-year study to find out how homeschoolers fared in the college setting as compared to Christian and public school graduates. The study tracked 180 students, 60 graduates each from homeschools, public schools, and Christian schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="269">Five success indicators were used in the study: Academic, Cognitive, Spiritual, Affective-Social, and Psychomotor. Galloway and Sutton found that in every success category except psychomotor, the homeschool graduates excelled above the other students. Out of 12 academic indicators, the homeschoolers ranked first in 10. Out of 11 spiritual indicators, homeschoolers ranked first in seven. In cognitive skills, homeschoolers ranked first in 17 of the 23 indicators. Out of 63 total indicators, homeschoolers ranked first in 42. In analyzing college aptitude, Galloway and Sutton found that &#147;homeschooled students demonstrate similar academic preparedness [and] achievement in college as students who have attended conventional schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="270">&#148; They concluded that, consistent with the success of homeschoolers at the elementary and secondary levels, &#147;homeschooled students can perform adequately in the different, and more advanced, academic setting of college-level study. Formerly homeschooled students enrolled at Boston University in the past four years have a 3.3 grade-point average (out of a possible 4.0) giving a good indicator of their overall success. Similarly, at Georgia&#146;s Kennesaw State University, homeschooled students had higher-than-average GPAs as freshmen. As a result of the Oral Roberts study, the University created a unique Homeschool College Preparatory Program for homeschooled students to earn a semester of college credit at home in advance and established a $6,000 scholarship especially for homeschool graduates, above and beyond all other financial aid. Eager to attract these bright young students, other colleges are developing homeschool scholarships. Belhaven College (MS) grants $1,000 a year to qualified home-educated students. Nyack College (NY) says their &#147;experience with homeschoolers has been a positive one&#148; and awards up to $12,000 to homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="271">College of the Southwest (NM) which awards up to $3,150 a year per homeschool student says that the general rule for homeschool students at the college is that they are &#147;very involved in campus life in addition to doing well academically. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and the National Christian College Athletic Association both have guidelines for homeschoolers. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has "guidelines to help standardize eligibility for homeschooled athletes. According to the guidelines, homeschooled athletes who have sufficiently high standardized test scores and proof that they took at least 13 courses that meet the association's core course standards may be automatically awarded freshman eligibility." An NCAA spokeswoman said that from 1988 to 1993, as many as 10 home-taught athletes applied for waivers each year. "In each of the past three years [1994-1996]," she said, "that number has grown to more than 20." The number is now as high as 75 students a year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="272">This year spokesman John Morris said that, during the 1998-99 school year, all 49 homeschooled waiver applicants for Division I and all 20 for Division II were approved. The number of homeschooled students taking Advanced Placement tests has more than tripled in the past five years. In the year 2000, only 410 homeschooled students took Advanced Placement tests, as opposed to 2005 where 1,282 homeschooled students took Advanced Placement tests. These are courses that are available online that provide rigorous study in various subject areas, like history, language, and literature. If the student scores well on the exam, it will enable the homeschool student to obtain scholarships from the university the student is seeking admission to. How Are Colleges Recruiting Home Schoolers? Attending state homeschool conventions and making specialized presentations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="273">Developing college preparatory programs targeted at homeschoolers. Sponsoring on-campus recruitment activities and visitation opportunities. Communicating regularly with statewide home school organizations. Joining homeschool radio network broadcasts. Conducting workshops for homeschoolers and their parents to help them plan for college admission (like Pennsylvania State&#146;s Home Schooling High Schoolers Conference). Offering special scholarships and grants. Advertising in brochures and homeschool publications like Teaching Home , Practical Homeschooling , Homeschooling Today , and other magazines.</paragraph><paragraph parID="274">In times past, colleges and universities have often&#151;and unnecessarily&#151;insisted that homeschoolers obtain a General Equivalency Diploma (GED) for financial aid. Because this requirement was usually based on the institution&#146;s concerns about federal funding regulations,HSLDA addressed the situation at its root. The Association drafted federal legislation to place homeschool college applicants for admissions and financial aid on the same footing as traditional applicants. This language was included in The Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998 (Pub. Although these amendments, enacted in early October 1998, changed what post-secondary schools could require of homeschool applicants, these new guidelines have only slowly reached local financial aid offices. Additional confusion was caused by the 2001-2002 Federal Financial Aid Handbook, which indicated that colleges would lose their institutional eligibility if they admitted homeschool students. Not wanting any institution or student to be caught uninformed, HSLDA has put together the following information for financial aid officers and applicants.</paragraph><paragraph parID="275">Once accepted by a university, a homeschooled student may be eligible for financial aid or an academic scholarship. When a college receives federal funds, its financial aid and scholarship programs are subject to federal regulations. In the past, these colleges instructed that, pursuant to federal law, homeschoolers must take a GED exam or an ability-to-benefit test to qualify for federal aid. However, this has all changed. The law now simply states that, in lieu of an accredited high school diploma or GED, a student is eligible for federal financial aid if "the student has completed a secondary school education in a homeschool setting that is treated as a homeschool or a private school under state law." Homeschoolers do not have to produce a GED or take an ability-to-benefit test any longer. This is affirmed by a recent revision in the 2005-2006 Federal Financial Aid Handbook which now states that a homeschool diploma is self-certifying, thus establishing that colleges can accept homeschoolers and still maintain institutional eligibility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="276">Some state legislatures and departments of education, recognizing the abilities and achievements of most home educated students, have written laws or regulations addressing the problems a homeschooler may face at college entrance. As studies consistently demonstrate, home educated high school graduates offer an academically successful and socially diverse background. As early as December 1991, U.S. News &amp;amp; World Report recognized that an &#147;estimated 50 percent of homeschooled students attend college, about the same rate as their public-school counterparts. &#148; According to a nationwide study published by Dr. Brian Ray in 1997, homeschool graduates continue to pursue either post-secondary education or employment at similar rates to public school graduates. In particular, these researchers discovered that college freshmen who had completed their entire high school education in a homeschool had a &#147;slightly higher overall . . . critical thinking score&#148; than students educated in public or private schools. He found the nationwide grand mean in reading for homeschoolers was at the 79th percentile; for language and math, the 73rd percentile. This ranking means home-educated students performed better than approximately 77% of the sample population on whom the test was normed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="277">Nearly 80% of homeschooled children achieved individual scores above the national average and 54.7% of the 16,000 homeschoolers achieved individual scores in the top quarter of the population, more than double the number of conventional school students who score in the top quarter. Current estimates place the number of home-educated students in the United States at 2 million and growing. Homeschooling is now a legal option for parents in all 50 states. Every year a significant portion of these students seek higher education. Individualized training with its multiple and varied alternative approaches cannot be measured accurately by traditional transcripts. Homeschoolers have a distinct advantage because of the individualized instruction they have received. The following comment, made by Jon Reider, Stanford&#146;s senior associate director of admissions concerning the success of homeschoolers, was reported in a recent article in the Wall Street Journal : &#147;Homeschoolers bring certain skills &#150; motivation, curiosity, the capacity to be responsible for their education &#150; that high schools don&#146;t induce very well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="278">During a fall 2004 interview, Phil Caffrey, Iowa State University's (ISU) director of admissions, stated that "homeschool students, on average, have higher grade-point averages" than the student body as a whole. Research has shown that homeschoolers on average do better than the national average on standardized achievement tests for the elementary and secondary grade levels. Statistics demonstrate that homeschoolers tend to score above the national average on both their SAT and ACT scores. This score is slightly higher that the 1997 report released on the results of 1926 homeschool graduates and founding homeschoolers maintained the average of 22.5. This is higher than the national average, which was 21.0 in both 1997 and 1998. The 1996 ACT results showed that in English, homeschoolers scored 22.5 compared to the national average of 20.3. In math, homeschoolers scored 19.2 compared to the national average of 20.2.</paragraph><paragraph parID="279">In reading, homeschoolers outshone their public school counterparts 24.1 to 21.3. In science, homeschoolers scored 21.9 compared to 21.1. Iowa State University's admissions department data shows that homeschoolers had a 26.1 mean ACT composite score as compared to a 24.6 mean score for all entering freshmen beginning fall 2003. The cumulative admissions data from UNI reveals that the average ACT score for homeschoolers was 2 points higher than that of regular freshmen: 25 versus 23. They concluded that overall, homeschoolers perform "as well as, if not better than, their conventionally educated counterparts." Homeschooling vs Public Schools: The pros and cons of homeschooling vs public schools is, quite frankly, an unfair contest, at least as far as your child is concerned.</paragraph><paragraph parID="280">There's no doubt in my mind that, in most cases, public schooling cannot match the advantages of homeschooling . The fact is, however good the teacher or the school, there is no substitute for the pros which come with homeschooling: When we look at the pros and cons of homeschooling vs public schools, you can see that schools are stuck in a trap. When it comes to the pros and cons of homeschooling vs public schooling, what are you hoping your child will get out of education ? If you think I'm suggesting that by choosing homeschooling over public schooling one of the pros and cons you have to weigh up is giving up any academic aspirations for your child, you're wrong. One look at the homeschooling statistics will show you that one of the pros of homeschool is that homeschoolers typically score 15 to 30 percentile points above public schools on standardized academic achievement tests. If I've done enough to rock the boat and show you why schools are not the place to send your child, see Part Two of my article on the pros and cons of homeschool vs public schooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="281">When it comes to the pros and cons of homeschooling vs public schools it's well worth knowing that you do have a choice and school isn't necessarily the right answer. See what John Taylor Gatto has to say: "School is a twelve year jail sentence where bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned. I teach school and win awards doing it. I should know." (John Taylor Gatto, Dumbing Us Down ) So how come public schooling has got so many cons ?</paragraph><paragraph parID="282">"We need to realize that the school institution 'schools' very well, though it does not 'educate'...It's just impossible for education and schooling ever to be the same thing." The Pros of Homeschooling The ability to follow your child's interests . One look at our homeschool lesson plans will show you just how far William and Catherine's love of dinosaurs has taken us. See how homeschool scheduling gives you a unique chance to organize your time in the way that best encourages your child to learn. I'm going to call on another iconic figure, John Holt , to explain more: "We like to say that we send children to school to teach them to think.</paragraph><paragraph parID="283">What we do, all too often, is to teach them to think badly , to give up a natural and powerful way of thinking in favour of a method that does not work well for them and that we rarely use ourselves." (John Holt, How Children Learn ) There's no getting away from the fact that there's a teacher with the task of schooling up to 30 children who may or may not want to learn. "The truth is schools don't really teach anything except how to obey orders ," (John Taylor Gatto, Dumbing Us Down ) The Cons of Public Schooling When you really look hard at the task public schools face, you begin to realize that it's not about the cons of one bad school or a few poor teachers. There are lots of very good schools and very good teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="284">But look what they're faced with: "One of the fundamental ideas behind most of what we do in school is that children should and must spend many years memorizing a lot of dull facts before they can begin to do interesting things with them. This is a foolish way to go about things, and it doesn't work," says John Holt. "Most children get so fed up with learning the dull facts that they quit before they get enough of them to do, or even to want to do, anything interesting with them. And even of the children who do learn all the facts, most have their wits so dulled in the process that they can't think of anything interesting to do with them." So I'm going to throw at you a bigger question. I'll leave you with another John Taylor Gatto quote:</paragraph><paragraph parID="285">"Formulaic schooling...must be killed , not modified. Attempts to tinker with its ruthless algorithms prolongs our society's agony and makes the situation worse," (John Taylor Gatto, Weapons of Mass Instruction ) In my opinion, this website is largely Reconstructionist, while those that link to it for furthering homeschooling might not be themselves. A Google search on Schanzenbach reveals his ministry is listed at the Reformed and Theonomic World View Index ( http://www.hisglory.us/ ) that describes itself as, "A Networking Tool for Cultural Leadership and Biblical Dominion." Religion seems the overwhelming criteria in homeschooling. These parents want a "Christian centered" education for their children and feel public education is hostile to their beliefs. But homeschool parents also set high standards in academics as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="286">The news articles show homeschoolers outscore both public and private school students on college entrance exams. Homeschoolers scores' fell between the 75th and 85th percentile, while public school students scored at the 50th percentile and private school students scored between the 65th and 75th percentile, according to the news articles. Homeschooling parents have an advantage in taking a direct part in their children's education. In fact, homeschooled people are the most balanced and well-rounded people I have ever met." There are also many homeschoolers in Virginia who have claimed religious exemption and are not reported...Those who are not registered with government schools (which are the vast majority) do not receive any help at all from the government schools. But as it has been pointed out, most homeschool families aren't high income at all. Isolation from the mainstream public seems the rule, except in the case of the Blankenbeckler family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="287">Warhurst believes the Bible requires parents to provide their children with a Christian education. In May 2005 the Bristol Herald Courier did a excellent series of reports on home schooling in the Bristol region. But their scope was narrow and the articles failed to point out several underlying issues. Tri-Cities Christian Schools for example pledge their allegiance to the American flag, the Christian flag and to the Bible every morning. Education and learning have always been a cornerstone of the Protestant ethic. Every year since the tracking began (1997), homeschooled students as a group have earned a significantly higher average composite scores than the national average. Less than 1 percent of all ACT-tested students are homeschoolers and they have no idea whether homeschooled test-takers are representative of the entire group.</paragraph><paragraph parID="288">The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) doesn't release data on homeschooled students. This was not a controlled experiment; what happened to those that drop-out or disappear from the system? The comparison to public school is unfair. Private schools can be selective and weed-out many problem students where a public school has to take everyone. By losing so many better students to private schools and homeschooling also drags down the overall average for public schools. In other words we measure society in general in public schools, not so much in private schools and homeschooling who tend to have better educated and higher income households. Who pays the cost for homeschooling?</paragraph><paragraph parID="289">Washington County, Virginia has about 222 homeschooling students costing the system $1,020,0000 per year ($4600 each) in state funding. Bristol, Virginia has 28 costing them $130,000. The students register with the school system, their curricula must be approved by the division, and they must be evaluated yearly. What isn't clear is does this continue once the students are pass the age to legally drop out of school? They take standardized tests and schools (public and private hoping to get the students back) help families with used textbooks or participation in drivers education. At least 1,000 students are homeschooled in this region according to state records. Nationally, 2.1 million.</paragraph><paragraph parID="290">Finally, we should note the articles showed homeschoolers do well in college, but these tended to be small private and/or religious colleges such as Emory &amp; Henry or King College in Bristol, Tennessee. A home schooler can go through their entire childhood and college life and never even meet anyone outside their own church or social class. But according to www.tricitieshomeschool.org , "Nearly all homeschooled people I know are highly successful in the "world" and among other social classes quite often. I've known some very successful Christian people that do fit in the outside world very well. That have confidence and an outstanding work ethic. On the www.tricitieshomeschool.org website there are 20 or so support groups for homeschooling. For example, we pay for all registration fees, books, supplies, field trips, and any other costs associated with our children's education."</paragraph><paragraph parID="291">Most had college and professional degrees themselves, so were qualified and their higher income also gave them the free time to accomplish the task. One article suggested this could be useful for low-income or problem students to get ahead, but this isn't realistic when most problems in the public schools originate in the home to begin with. And when do working-class or low-income families have the time when both parents work multiple jobs to pay the bills? Income is also indicative of education in most cases. The most extreme case here is that of the McRea family. Their main reason is "other children had a negative social effect on their children." They didn't like the school telling them what to do or having their lives revolved around the schools schedule, they claimed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="292">"We do not specifically get them involved in a social setting so they can meet other kids...we really don't think children have a good influence on one another." Quoting their daughter Donna, "I don't know how to act when I'm around other girls..." While the McReas complained that academics weren't rigid enough in a private Christian school, it's obvious isolating their children was the main motive. These people have their own 4H Clubs, Scout troops, etc. To quote, "the area's home schooled, who participate in all the usual activities of youth without ever interacting with traditionally schooled students." All outside activities, including cooperative classes in things such as chemistry and Latin, are through certain churches, usually Baptist or Presbyterian. There's a good reason for this. Political Agenda</paragraph><paragraph parID="293">The Tennessee Baptist Convention is one of ten state conventions advocating removal of children from public schools they see as hostile to their brand of militant fundamentalism. (PCA) Westminster Presbyterian's Rev. Steve Warhurst in Kingsport, Tennessee was behind that effort at the PCA convention. And he says they're not getting it in public school systems. However, the PCA's General Assembly in Chattanooga voted to reject Warhurst's resolution that encouraged parents to home-school or place children in private schools." To quote Warhurst, "a truly Christian education begins with fear of the Lord, and teaches children to think biblically about all of life...The public schools are not doing that...people on both sides would say that's obviously not happening...We believe there is a Biblical way to think about history and literature and science, and it has a different perspective than what would be taught from an atheistic perspective, or even a Muslim or Jewish perspective...We think the children should be taught to think biblically." He continues, "I'd say that's a good reason to home-school children...I'm not really interested in the socialization...When I see the effects of socialization on children, it seems to promote rebellion...30 hours of public, anti-Christian education a week are hard to override in an hour of church..." But what's the problem with private Christian schools? I was homeschooled myself; we had a big family, so we had plenty of social interaction, but I felt the one thing that we lacked was discipline.</paragraph><paragraph parID="294">If I had been more disciplined, I would have achieved more. I've been looking at a lot of websites, and all of them say that usually the one con to homeschooling is not having enough social interaction (and that's only if you don't have a big family; trust me, I know). But there are programs that you can enroll in, sports programs, scouts, extra curriculum programs - there are options. I don't want him to have to put up with all of the crap that's out there; its one thing to explain it, so that he's educated , and knows what to expect, and it's another to put him right in the middle of it. So many kids lose their way, because they are thrust into the world, at such a young age, and some kids go down the wrongs roads, and there's really nothing you can do about it, because some kids choose for themselves what they will do, no matter what their parents say. Yes, a con of homeschooling could be not having adequate social interaction. However, as you state, there are many programs and opportunities for homeschooling children, from having friends over to visit, to participating in organized sports, co-ops, etc., so social interaction really isn't an issue.</paragraph><paragraph parID="295">As far as discipline, yes, you do need it! I like that you can see where your family struggled in their homeschooling journey; as a parent, you can choose to do things differently. I don't think anything can compare to the one-on-one learning experience your son will have with you as his teacher and mother. The vast difference isn't seen until students reach the later elementary through high school years; it is then that many homeschooled student stand above their public schooled peers. Benefits to Homeschooling: Making The Right Choice Young mom wants to share some of the benefits to homeschooling with her public schooled husband... Hi, I have one son, he's a year and a half, and I'm trying to figure out what is the best choice for him: public school, or homeschool?</paragraph><paragraph parID="296">I don't want that to happen to my son, and yet I know that homeschooling is so much more beneficial to the individual if you do it right . My husband was public schooled, and so you know his preference. :) I guess my dilemma is trying to convince him the benefits to homeschooling versus public schooling. I love the thought that I can be with my son everyday, and help him with his education, to see him grow. I want something better for my son. I will help my son rise.

An excellent source of support and encouragement for homeschooling! For the past several days we have been working on a summary of the recent suit filed in federal court by HSLDA, requesting that home schools not be considered private schools under the Gun Free School Zones Act.</paragraph><paragraph parID="305">We feel this action is unwarranted, unnecessary, and potentially threatening to home schooling freedoms everywhere. The Home School Legal Defense Association has filed a complaint in federal court requesting a declaratory judgment that "home schools are NOT private schools." HSLDA alleges that their plaintiffs, along with home schools in 16 other states where home schoolers operate "private schools," have "no adequate remedy at law" as "it is unlawful for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm . . . in a school zone." "Home schools" are not defined in either Texas or federal statute. According to the Leeper decision, Texas home schools are legally considered "private schools." The obvious danger in being treated SEPARATELY from "private schools" is that home schools may no longer be able to continue enjoying EQUAL protection with "private schools." Given the leeway allowed private schools (which home schools in Texas legally are) to approve any firearm program at all, it's clear that the plaintiffs have sufficient relief from any alleged prohibition in their private residence.</paragraph><paragraph parID="306">Will the court dismiss the complaint, or will it decide to recognize a difference between "home schools" and "private schools?" HSLDA asks that home schools be excluded from the meaning of "private school" -- for the purpose of this Act only. This one judicial decision could revoke the "private school" status of nearly half the home schools in this country without the vote of a single State representative. Even if "home schools" are exempted in the statutory definition of "school zones," eliminating any potential problem at the state level, it's an open question whether federal enforcement will be a problem. Only statutory home school programs operating under the supervision of the public schools, i.e. complying with an explicit Home Education statute, will have cause for alarm should they own any firearms. Magaw wrote that "Should a 'home' school be recognized by State law as a 'school' as defined by section 921(a)(26), the possession of a firearm on the grounds of such school or within 1,000 feet of school grounds would violate the law." For statutory home schools, private property and the school grounds are one and the same.</paragraph><paragraph parID="307">The term "school" is defined as "a school which provides elementary or secondary education, as determined under State law." It is unclear whether Magaw is referring to "private schools" as HSLDA alleges, or statutory "home schools." Perhaps Magaw is unfamiliar with the difference between "private" and "statutory" home schools. Statutory home schools are not treated equitably with respect to private schools. There is certainly significant government interest in REMOVING the disparity in treatment between home schoolers in "private school states" versus home schoolers in "home school states." The government can not regulate "private schools," only statutory "home schools." If home schools are NOT private, then they are open game for State regulation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="308">Home schools are safe from regulation as long as they remain under the protective umbrella of "private schools." If home schools are EXCLUDED from the definition of "private schools" as requested by HSLDA, regulation will follow. The results - 35.2 percent of blacks viewed public education as excellent/good while 53.7 percent of the general population viewed public education as excellent/good. The best research on homeschooling indicates the total number of children who are homeschooled is 1.5 to 2 million, and that number is growing by 10 to 15 percent per year. But not everyone recognizes the academic and social success of homeschoolers and some criticize the movement as being white and elitist. While it's true that the large majority of homeschool children are white, the number of black homeschoolers is growing rapidly. Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, estimates that there are 30,000 to 50,000 black children being homeschooled today.</paragraph><paragraph parID="309">Others estimate that black homeschoolers make up 5 percent of the total homeschool population. Most importantly black homeschool movement is growing at a faster rate than the general homeschool population. One of the chief reasons for this growth is the general dissatisfaction among blacks with public schools. In a 2002 survey conducted by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, 850 black adults were polled concerning their views on public education. As part of the same survey, 850 adults in the general population were asked the same questions. Of the black population surveyed 25.4 percent said public education was poor, versus 14.3 percent of the general population. The study shows that many black families have concluded that government-run schools have failed them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="310">For 50 years since the Supreme Court decided the case of Brown v. Board of Education, minorities, especially blacks, have been told that public schools would "save them." With 57 percent of blacks supporting school choice, it's clear that black families are seeking alternatives. To facilitate the growth of the black homeschool movement, several organizations have been established recently. The National Black Home Educators Resource Association (NBHERA) was founded by Joyce and Eric Burges, veteran homeschoolers living in Baker, Louisiana. Explaining why they started the organization, Mrs. Burges says, "Black families have always valued education - this is one of the reasons many black families taught and teach their children at home. Black families felt, and still do feel, that education is the door to our people's freedom. Many families across the nation are returning to the old- fashioned method of teaching learned years ago from our ancestors."</paragraph><paragraph parID="311">Homeschooling for black families is not a new idea, it's an old idea revisited. While homeschooling is experiencing rapid growth, the decision to homeschool is a significant one. Successful homeschooling requires time, effort and commitment. Almost every parent considering homeschooling experiences is nervous to some extent. A little voice inside asks, "Can I really do this? What if I ruin my child's life? Is it really legal?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="312">But black families face an additional obstacle. Mrs. Burges explains it this way. "Because black Americans were part of the civil rights movement who had to fight and struggle to gain a place at the table of public education, they find the idea of not having their children participate in a public education system as turning their back on the civil rights movement and their friends and relatives, as well." Gilbert Wilkerson, founder of Network of Black Homeschoolers in Richmond, Virginia, explains that the primary goal for starting his organization was to bring black people out of the mentality that they have to settle for government programs. "Why are we waiting around for somebody else, like the government and others, to give us a hand for something we can do ourselves? I know we can do better," he says. The future looks bright for minority homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="313">In a survey of selected classes at Vanderbilt University and Nashville State Tech, almost half (45.3 percent) of black students said "yes" or "maybe" when asked if they would homeschool their own children. Among other non-Caucasian groups, two-thirds indicated "yes" or "maybe." By contrast, less than one-fourth of the white students said they would homeschool their children. The changing attitudes of minorities indicates that public educators can't count indefinitely on the loyalty of ethnic minorities as the backbone of big city schools. The percentage of minority homeschoolers will grow rapidly in the future and one day might equal non-minority homeschoolers. We look forward to the day when large numbers of minority children experience the American Dream by receiving the education they need for success.

How Homeschooling Ruined Us For Public School When my husband and I lived abroad, we made the decision to homeschool our daughter. Homeschooling has also allowed time for such interesting topics of study and opportunities in the community the we never seemed to have time for when she was taking the school bus. Local schools were out of the question because of their competitive and atheistic underpinnings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="316">The price of international schools was exorbitant compared to the quality of education. Since I had an education background, homeschooling was an easy choice to make. Fast forward nine years. We returned to our native country and were faced again with the choice of schooling options. For the sake of a smooth transition into American life, we decided to continue homeschooling our middle schooler. But over the months, I've been asked several times why I don't send Sprite to public school now that it is an option again. Little do these people know that Sprite has been ruined forever for public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="317">After all of our years of homeschooling, I don't think she could survive in "normal" school. Or if she did, it would be at the expense of precious character traits. Creativity My creative daughter is forever imagining skits and craft projects. The "fill in the bubble, walk in a straight line, write it this way" formula for learning would rub against the grain of her right brained thinking. With homeschooling, we can harness her creativity for projects that promote learning. There are no right or wrong answers to be ferreted out, just experiences to be had. In order to succeed in school, my daughter would have to stop being so creative and learn to conform.</paragraph><paragraph parID="318">The emphasis on outward structures would mystify her since we have always valued meaning over form. Fine Arts Along with her creative bent is a love of fine arts. There is no way that a public or even private school could offer her the wealth of art instruction we have had. Field trips would be few to none; drawing instruction would be rare if at all. Fostering her passion for fine arts would require a lot of work on my part, work that I'm already doing. But with the schedule of public school and the demands of homework, we would not have nearly as much time to devote to the arts. Competition Instead of using grades with my daughter, I focus on improvement, learning, and diligence in our homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="319">Because she has no classmates to compare with, Sprite is free to grow at her own pace without feeling like a loser when she is "behind" or a geek when she is "advanced." In public school, the constant feedback of numeric grades would be a huge paradigm shift for her. Would she feel inadequate when her grades were not all As? Or would she become prideful and scorn those with lower grades? Would she start working for the sake of the grade instead of for the joy of learning? Popular Culture If my daughter were in public school all day long, I can only imagine the influence that popular culture would have on her as she absorbed from the children who are saturated in television, movies, and video games. Just being in American church has opened up new worlds of television stars, pop singers, and online games that we never knew about before.</paragraph><paragraph parID="320">How would public school affect my media-sheltered child? Or would she be constantly traumatized? Or would she become calloused to the violence and occult that are so common in popular books and videos? Flexibility Years of setting our own schedule has given us the freedom to travel, take extracurricular classes, and pursue personal passions. The rigidity of a traditional school schedule would lock us out of the freedom we've grown accustomed to. No longer could we rearrange the academic timetable to suit our preferences or tangents. Sprite would constantly feel the chafe of being a cog in the wheel of an institution.</paragraph><paragraph parID="321">She would resent the artificial constraints of school schedules and scope and sequence charts. Yes, I admit it. My child doesn't fit into public schools. She probably could have if she had started off in Kindergarten seven years ago. But we've ruined her through years of homeschooling. I'm sure that if life demanded public school, she would learn to cope. She would comply and give up some of her creative thinking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="322">She would grow less involved in fine arts and would grow more desensitized to the worldliness of our society. She would evaluate herself through the lens of a numeric grade and conform to the pattern of school life. Looking at the big picture, though, I'm quite happy with her ruin. In fact, I plan on ruining her right on through high school. Are your children "ruined?" I'd love to hear how you've ruined them by homeschooling. Just leave a comment below.</paragraph><paragraph parID="323">Jimmie is a former public school teacher turned homeschooling stay-at-home-mom.

There's no way she could participate in her beloved snowboarding if she was in school. Wow what a beautifully written post! Everything you stated is every reason why I continue to consider homeschooling my 6th grade daughter.</paragraph><paragraph parID="326">Everything leads me to doing it until someone convinces me about the possibilities of ruining her. Well now, after reading this, I can smile and say," that's the idea!" In Instead of Education (p. 19), Holt uses the spelling S-chool to denote "[t]he schools for educators, which get and hold their students by the threat of jail or uselessness or poverty," and s-chools to denote "[t]he schools for do-ers, which help people explore the world as they choose." By focusing on the work of author and teacher John Holt though, one can trace not only a personal journey from school reformer to unschooler, but also an intellectual and educational legacy that led to homeschooling that is little reported by conservative and liberal media alike. Many school reformers, such as Herbert Kohl, noted that it is a wide variety of methods, materials, schedules, and techniques that help children learn, and that the teacher should have the freedom to use any combination of things and ideas to help students. After Deschooling Society appeared, Holt studied and corresponded with Illich at length, and was deeply influenced by Illich's analysis, particularly with his analysis that school serves a deep social function by firmly maintaining the status quo of social class for the majority of students. Further, schools view education as a commodity they sell, rather than as a life-long process they can aid, and this, according to Illich, creates a substance that is not equally distributed, is used to judge people unfairly, and -- based on their lack of school credentials -- prevents people from assuming roles they are otherwise qualified for.</paragraph><paragraph parID="327">Holt continued to develop these ideas and practices in his next book, which led directly to his work in homeschooling. In August of 1977, the first issue of Growing Without Schooling (GWS) was published, and the nation's, and probably the world's, first periodical about homeschooling was born. It is, I feel, important to note that Holt never believed that more than a very small percentage of parents would homeschool even if it were a widely accepted practice, which is why he never gave up trying to help schools change. Holt urged educators and parents to catch the spirit of unschooling, be inspired by the variety of approaches and methods homeschoolers show, and reconsider assumptions about schooling based on what ordinary parents, as well as some alternative schools, were doing with children. Likewise, Holt's support of homeschooling parents, many of whom have never been professional teachers, is inspiring. Twenty-two years after Holt wrote that, more and more writers about homeschooling keep creating new ways to define themselves, since they agree only with bits and pieces of various practices. Some families prefer to develop communal resources rather than buying them; they join together to form homeschooling co-ops and learning centers in people's homes or to share facilities, costs, and teachers for group instruction.</paragraph><paragraph parID="328">Homeschooling continues to spread across the United States and other countries; as of this writing, GWS contains listings for homeschooling support groups in Canada, Ireland, England, France, Australia, Spain, South Africa, New Zealand, and Japan. Far from being a new idea, homeschooling has grown and developed over the centuries, and came into focus in the late 20th century as the forces of standardization and cultural homogenization took over schools and people sought alternatives to them. The battles over look-say reading methods versus phonics, training teachers to be gentle facilitators or drill instructors, whether to encourage hands-on learning or test-taking skills, were well-worn battles to these writers even in the sixties. Further, some writers, such as A. S. Neill and Holt, suggested that the student should have complete freedom to choose how, when, and from whom they wanted to learn. Hal Bennett wrote an operator's manual in 1972 entitled No More Public School , which explains how you can take your child out of public school and educate him at home. In The 12-Year Sentence (1974), a collection of essays edited by William F. Rickenbacker, one of the writers proposed that gifted parents should be able to teach their own children if they wish. In Instead of Education: Ways to Help People Do Things Better (1976), Holt not only described actual non-compulsory schools, learning centers, and informal learning arrangements in action, but also proposed</paragraph><paragraph parID="329">Holt often wrote that there is no need to duplicate institutional teaching and assumptions in non-institutional settings, and he therefore saw no need to make parents anxious about their abilities to learn from their children how to best teach them. He cites various mass literacy programs used in a number of poor countries in which as fast as people learn to read they begin to teach others, as well as various schools whose policy of allowing older children to teach younger children to read has borne excellent results. Some may feel that the schools teach a dog-eat-dog competitiveness; others that they teach a mealy-mouth Socialism. Some may feel that the schools teach too much religion; others that they don't teach enough, but teach instead a shallow atheistic humanism. I think the schools degrade both science and religion, and do not encourage either strong faith or strong critical thought. What is important is not that all readers of GWS should agree on [the reasons for a family to homeschool], but that we should respect our differences while we work for what we agree on, our right and the right of all people to take their children out of schools, and help, plan, or direct their learning in the ways they think best. Some are uncomfortable with unschooling, since Holt asks parents to respect children and allow them freedom to pursue their intellectual interests (although he never dictates that they do so), particularly when these interests veer away from school subject matter; some prefer to literally do home school, with the national anthem sung each morning, six hours of school work with a break for recess, and so on.</paragraph><paragraph parID="330">Some purchase canned curricula and follow them to the letter; others purchase curricula and use them as broad outlines. Some homeschoolers work with private schools through the mail or the internet. The changes made both books significantly different from their original printings, and Holt kept the original text alongside the newer text so that the reader can see the differences. Both books are worth reading on their own of course, but they also serve as demonstrations of Holt's philosophy that living and learning are interrelated, that we learn more from our mistakes and successes than from tests and instruction, and that it is never too late to learn more about ourselves and the world in which we live. Often Holt would get a speaking engagement at a large university and when he was done there he would travel to speak to local homeschoolers in smaller venues, such as parks, homes, and small hotels. The decision of whether to home school a child or to send a child to public school is a personal one. Not only is the parent's time and ability to act as a teacher important, but whether the child's education and socialization needs will be met must also be considered.</paragraph><paragraph parID="331">While by no means do all home school curriculums include religious instruction, unlike public schools it is possible to include the topic as often as a parent would like. Public schools typically provide students with advanced technological tools to supplement their education. These include calculators and scientific lab tools such as beakers, burners and chemicals. Some of these items, such as calculators, are easily obtainable by homeschooling parents, but others, such as chemicals are not. One of the biggest benefits to homeschooling is the ability for the curriculum and lesson plans to be adjusted to the student's learning style. Moreover, lesson plans can be as creative and unique as a parent wants. Chemistry classes can take place in the kitchen and botany classes in the family's garden.</paragraph><paragraph parID="332">It is very easy to spend more time on a subject if a parent feels the student has not yet grasped it completely, and it is also easy to breeze through a subject that the student masters faster than anticipated. This is one aspect of homeschooling that public schools often cannot match. Ultimately, the decision of whether to home school your child is a question of whether the program and curriculum of homeschooling vs public schools is a better fit for both you and your child. At school students learn how to interact with other children and adults, appropriately respond to conflict and developing friendships. Homeschooling does not completely eliminate a student's chance to socialize with other children their age, but significantly reduces the amount of time spent interacting with others. With homeschooling, parents can introduce the topics of study as well as the lesson plans covering that topic. In a home school curriculum science, math and other subjects can be taught through religious texts and contain religious-themed lesson plans and assignments.</paragraph><paragraph parID="333">A home school curriculum can, but does not need, to be religiously based. State required curriculums and the number of students requires teachers to keep all students on the same track for the sake of ease. Whether children receive their education in a public, private, or parochial school, or at home, music education remains a core subject, and MENC maintains that adequate music education resources should be available to all students, regardless of how children obtain their education. Currently, homeschoolers' participation in music education is affected by three issues: whether the district is required to provide the service, the problem of how to determine student eligibility, and the creation of a financial burden for the district. In addition, issues arise regarding performance requirements for participation in extracurricular and co-curricular activities and about priority for enrollment due to limited space and availability of classes, activities, and materials. Unfortunately, because of these issues, or because of a philosophical reluctance by some school districts to cooperate with homeschoolers, an "us against them" atmosphere has been fostered in some areas. Consequently, the families, the communities, and the children involved can miss out on an opportunity to create a positive, empowering relationship.</paragraph><paragraph parID="334">Homeschooled Students' Participation in Public School Music Education Depending on the state, homeschoolers may be treated as a private school or as some other category, neither public school nor private school. In recent years, more students who are not enrolled in public school want access to public school resources, activities, and classrooms, especially in the areas of the arts, sports, and advanced math and sciences. Parents of homeschooled children argue that their tax dollars help pay for public school facilities, faculty, staff, and instructional materials, as well as curricular and extracurricular programs such as music instruction. If the numbers of homeschooled children requesting public school services increase significantly, funding issues will need to be addressed by all who are affected by them. Participation in curricular or extracurricular programs by homeschooled students is determined by state and local school district policy, and policies vary from district to district. Adopt minimum academic requirements for homeschoolers equivalent to those that conventional students must meet in order to participate in cocurricular music activities where such requirements exist.</paragraph><paragraph parID="335">If the school district allows homeschoolers to enroll as part-time students in order to participate in music classes, discuss how registration will work for popular classes that accommodate only a limited number of students. Be aware of your district's policy on homeschoolers' participation in school-related activities and keep abreast of changes in policy. Be respectful but clear with parents about what participation in school programs will entail, letting them know what will be expected of them, and what obligations they will have to the school district. Hold all students to the same standards for behavior, performance, attendance, grade requirements, standards for participation in extracurricular activities, and other classroom rules. Taking this into consideration, the stereotype of white racist homeschoolers must be reexamined alongside the more feasible reasons for homeschooling, including the failing condition of America's public education system. Minority families are continually turning to homeschooling as an approach to educating their children (Farris, 1997; Holland, 2001). Minorities battle subtle forms of racism every day in public schools (Sarver, 2003), so it would be no surprise that the reason so many minorities are leaving public education may have to do with an attempt to escape the passive forms of institutional racism they are subjected to (Boyden, Johnson, and Pittz, 2001).</paragraph><paragraph parID="336">The concentration of research appears to be focused on whether students who are homeschooled were disadvantaged compared to their counterparts in either the private or public school systems (Anderson, 2000; Bauman. In the early 1990s, it was determined that many white families had vacated the public school system and started homeschooling their children (Bauman. 2001; Bielick, Chandler, and Broughman, 1999). Why would white, as well as minority, parents pull their children from public schools? Could this surge of popularity in homeschooling for whites and minorities be considered a reflection of the public school system, rather than a case for racism? Conversely, current research supporting homeschooling points to the practice not as racist, but as a way of exercising conscientious educational choice in the mist of disappointing public school environments (Bauman. It was reported that 75 percent of all homeschooled pupils are Caucasian, compared to 65 percent for publicly schooled pupils.</paragraph><paragraph parID="337">And most importantly, homeschooling is actually forcing the public to take notice of the condition of America's public schools (Bauman, 2001). Children given the proper atmosphere and opportunity will prosper and do well in life. It has been determined that minority and white students test out at equivalent levels when they are homeschooled (Gillespie, 1997). However, when minority students are compared to white students in a public school setting, significant academic differences appear. White students test at substantially higher levels then their ethnic counterparts in public school environments. The issue of class distinctions should be immediately dispelled, unless a student attends a public school (Gillespie, 1997; Ray, 1997; Wall Street Journal, 1997). Available data proves that homeschooled children do well with parental guidance (Bauman.</paragraph><paragraph parID="338">The top three finishers at the 2000 national spelling bee were all homeschooled by their parents. Four of the top ten finalists in the national geography bee were also homeschooled by their parents (Scott, 2000). Homeschool success results are often overlooked in an effort to discredit this movement (Anderson, 2000). So why would the National Education Association not deem parents qualified to teach (Schlafly, 1995; Schlafly, 2000; Sowell, 2000)? Heston (1999) characterizes the anguish many homeschoolers have felt, due to their position against state-sponsored public education. As more Americans continue to hear about homeschool successes in the United States, and as many of these same Americans begin to feel a sense of betrayal on the part of public education, we can see why so many Americans are willing to turn to this alternative form of education (Albert, 2003; Arsen, 2003; Haberman, 2003). There is no central mechanism that controls America's homeschoolers, unlike that of America's public schools (Bielick, Chandler, &amp; Broughman, 1999).</paragraph><paragraph parID="339">On the contrary, homeschoolers make an individual choice to teach their children, and enjoy the independence of teaching their children in the way they see fit. The homeschool movement is not collective with a singular mode of thinking, unlike that of the public schools today (Taylor, and Hughes, 2003; Mintz, 2003). Each family determines their own reasons for homeschooling, they might very well be religious, but more often the motivation for homeschooling appears to be the failure of public school education (Rado, 1999; Rudner, 1999). Homeschool parents are finding their American heritage, and concluding that it does not take a governmental autocracy to educate a nation (Grigg, 1997; Heston, 1997; Kang, 2001; Krueger, 2000; Lieberman, 2000). Yet again, all too often many public school advocates consider homeschoolers either racist or fanatics (Clowes, 1995; Danehy, 1999; Goldfarb, 1999). This smear campaign is based on an attack in order to deflect actual blame for the failures of America's public schools (Johnson, Piana, and Burlingame, 2000; Johnson, Boyden, and Pittz, 2001; Limbaugh, 2002). Education Secretary Paige made a comment about a parent's right to select a school that meets a child's needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="340">Education Secretary Page asserted that this could mean a private school, a homeschool or a public school. Education Secretary Page, an African American, said that the United States education system is under performing, leaving many minority children behind (Stames, 2003). Homeschooling is not to blame for the many failures of public education (Freund, 1997). Homeschooling cost less then public education (Wall Street Journal, 1997). Many students are being passed ahead to the next grade level even though they are not qualified to do so (McAvoy, 1998). Racism claims have been made evident in public schools as well as with homeschooling (Danehy, 1999; Boyden, Johnson, and Pittz, 2001). With all this said, opponents of homeschooling still contend that public education is the only avenue for true racial integration and learning (Schlafly, 2000).</paragraph><paragraph parID="341">The path of differences seems to be widening between homeschoolers and those of public educators (Marshal and Valle, 1996). There appears to be a concern that public support for public education is crumbling. Many public schools, unions, and educational bureaucrats, have done a lot to hurt American education today. Many local communities consider their public schools to be a waist of taxpayer money. This view is making it increasing harder to pass local tax increases for public education (Cloud and Morse, 2001). Furthermore, administrators and teachers are not held accountable for the failure of public schools today. The National Education Association is not held accountable to local school boards or parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="342">The National Education Association only answers to its membership. Homeschooling has served to discredit public schools through its usage of less money, and better test scores (Roberts, 2003). Teachers are leaving public school education due to a lack of professionalism, and collapsing educational standards. Due to this continued shortage many school districts are forced to import teachers from overseas under the H-1B visa program (Roberts, 2003). Teacher shortages are only one of many growing complaints of public education (Sappenfield, 2002). Homeschool parents have witnessed this failure first hand, and have decided to exit public schools for the development of their children (Kang, 2001). Public schools that teach in high ethnic population centers have almost two times as many teachers who have no qualifications for the subjects in which they are teaching.</paragraph><paragraph parID="343">Public schools are often overflowing with inferior math teachers who never specialized in math during college; French teachers teaching biology; art teachers teaching history; many have no education about the topics they have been assigned to teach. The public school systems main concern is the self-preservation of its tax-subsidized teachers, not educational enlightenment. Public education today may be bordering on malpractice (Malkin, 2002). The National Household Education Surveys Program (1999) reports that varying reasons were given for homeschooling, including (a) better education provided at home, (b) poor learning environments in public schools, and (c) religious reasons. Indeed, an increase in public school drug use, gang activity and violence has been found to be additional reasons for parents to homeschool their children. Leadership domain among the homeschooled group was substantially higher than their counterparts from the private as well as public high school groups. With regard to motivating educational factors, Galloway &amp; Sutton (2000), discovered no significant dissimilarities between three sampled college bound areas, (a) regular high school students, (b) private high school students, and (c) homeschooled high school students.</paragraph><paragraph parID="344">America's public school teachers do not send their own children to many of the schools in which they teach, but homeschoolers do (Haberman, 2003; Rudner, 1999). Public school educators continually debate the effectiveness of homeschooling when it comes to meeting the needs of an expanding multicultural society (Closson, 2002). None of the studied indicators, however, determined racism was a cause for homeschooling (Bielick, Chandler, &amp; Broughman, 1999; Howie, 2003; McCain, 2001). A lack of socialization in homeschooling is a common theme espoused by opponents of America's homeschool movement. Research has proven that homeschoolers are not affected negatively by their homeschool experience. In the research conducted by Galloway &amp; Sutton (2000), homeschoolers who went to college showed no significant social skill deprivation from their experience. A study by Knowles and Muchmore (1995) concluded that the issue of social development of homeschoolers is overstated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="345">Adults, who were homeschooled as children, exhibited no characteristics that implied any future disadvantage. Homeschooled children develop normally with regard to social skill development. Homeschooled children are neither aided by nor diminished by their homeschooled environments (Clery, 1998). Home-based charter schooled students were not negatively influenced with regard to their homeschooled experiences and socialization capabilities (Butz, 2001). Research asserts that parents who homeschooled primarily sought a solid education for their children (Miles, 1995). Whether homeschooling is legal or not is a point often brought up by the opposition to denounce the practice. Each state varies with regard to required regulations .</paragraph><paragraph parID="346">The public schools became significant building blocks toward class racism within American society (Veris, 1996). Ninety percent of all classroom teachers in the United States are white, and this bias is often demonstrated in America's classrooms. Both parties know very well that homeschool children do well with regard to test scores and social development (Schlafly, 1995; Schlafly, 2000). Educators obtain little training in preparing them for multicultural classrooms. Public schools have multicultural education as a goal, but its success is still debatable (Wardle, 2000). Many homeschool organizations believe that the claim of white homeschoolers being racist has a lot to do with platform positions of the National Education Association. The NEA believes that a homeschool environment cannot offer a comprehensive education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="347">The NEA also maintains that homeschool students must not partake in any extracurricular activity on school grounds (Schlafly, 2000). It is the divide between public school education and alternative forms of education that has led to so much rhetorical stereotypes (Home School Legal Defense Association News, 2003; Miller, 2003; World Net Daily, 2002). The NEA has led the fight against America's homeschool movement (Robinson, 2000). The NEA's interest is served by not acknowledging the truth about America's successful homeschool movement (Schlafly, 2000; Schlafly, 1995; Zysk, 2000). Resolutions passed at the 1984 convention include (a) home instructors must meet state teacher qualification requirements, (b) consent to home education must be authorized by the state, (c) home instruction must be supervised by the state, (d) compulsory testing is a requirement, (e) supplementary public school teaching must be available, and (f) students must be calculated into the daily average with no pro-ration. The NEA's position is that homeschooling cannot offer America's children a complete education as compared to that of public schools (Robinson, 2000). Public school educators have a vested interest in stopping America's homeschool movement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="348">Many public officials continue to legally prosecute homeschool families. In his 1999 article, Home-schooled kids shouldn't be playing high school athletics, Danehy stated that he hated the idea of homeschooling and considers it a type of child abuse. Many minority families are finding that homeschooling is an alternative to that of public school education (Bauman, 2001). It would appear that the battle lines have been drawn between public education and the homeschool movement. Public school and homeschool advocates continue to attack each other's position (Cardiff, 1996). By bleeding millions of dollars in funding and eroding public confidence in traditional education America's homeschool movement has turned into a major threat to the existence of public education (Cloud and Morse, 2001). Even though liberal Democrats have prevented disadvantaged children from leaving public education, many are finding refuge in America's homeschool movement (Littlepage, 2003).</paragraph><paragraph parID="349">Parents have decided to steward the education of America's children, rather than letting public educators. Yet, public educators want to displace parental teachings with those of national policies (Grigg, 1997). There is nothing more important then erecting barriers between homeschooling and the power of public education, thereby restoring a families right to educate free individuals (Grigg, 1997). As hard as the National Education Association struggles to sustain the status quo of public school education in America, more and more parents are deciding to leave in order to seek out better educational opportunities for their children (Lines, 1999; Marshal, and Valle, 1996; McDowell, Sanchez, and Jones, 2000; Rudner, 1999). It has been determined that each homeschool child's education cost is approximately $546 per year, compared to the yearly public school student's costs of $5,325 (Wall Street Journal, 1997). The National Education Association is blindly attacking the homeschool movement, while harboring institutional racism in America's public schools (Berlak, 2001; Blair, 1998; Buac, 2003; Cardiff, 1996; Clowes, 1995; Cooperman, 2003; Cuthbert, 2002; Danehy, 1999; Goldfarb, 1999; Haberman, 2003). Studies show that social development does not influence homeschooled children when they become adults (Knowles, and Muchmore, 1995).</paragraph><paragraph parID="350">This is one more indication of the severe problems haunting the public school system: violence, illegal drugs, the mandating of medication such as Ritalin, low academic achievement, controversial curricula, perceived prejudice against boys. Parents who wish to explore educational alternatives at their own expense should be encouraged to do so, yet the opposite is occurring. Advocates of public schooling view other systems of education as threats to be regulated, discouraged and sometimes demonized. Neither prevents anyone from choosing public schools; each merely offers a choice at no public expense. Today homeschooled students often perform better on standardized tests than those from public schools. Parents who use their own judgment and money in educating their children deprive no other parent of that same right. If public schools, with all their advantages, cannot compete with free market options, then they deserve to weaken because children deserve better .</paragraph><paragraph parID="351">As homeschooling entered the mainstream and a generation of homeschooled children scored well on tests, public suspicion faded. My purpose is not to dispute with parents who send their children to public schools. Apprenticeships, experiments like Montessori and the School of Living , self-guided education, mentoring ... The cost of public education is not measured in tax dollars alone. A universe of educational possibilities has been obstructed by the attempt to enforce a government monopoly over how, where, when, and what children learn. Clearly, public schools are not a necessary path to that social goal. Homeschoolers were viewed as extremists and unqualified amateurs. Homeschooling is now said to mask child abuse.</paragraph><paragraph parID="352">Thus, all New Jersey homeschoolers may be subjected to indignities like criminal background checks and obstacles like health regulations more stringent than those imposed on public schools. Malkin concluded, "God forbid children be taught by their own parents without oversight from the all-knowing, all-caring, infallible ... child welfare-public school monopoly!" I advocate extending alternatives far beyond the typical private versus public school debate, and even beyond homeschooling. Anecdotally, there may be weird or creepy parents who are home schooling but this is not the norm and the movement should not be judged by the inappropriate behavior of the exceptions any more than public schools should be judged by one creepy child molesting of one or two public school teachers. On the other hand, our public schools are among the most expensive in the world and produce academically mediocre results. The public schools are failing to educate. Without blaming anyone, good parenting demands that we take the action necessary to make sure that our kids do not fall into the meat-grinder of the public schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="353">For atheletic facilities, bus service and other things too numerous to mention, they STILL are relying on the PUBLIC SCHOOL to provide. I was "homeschooled" through 8th grade, not due to any religious reason or critique of the school system (and we sure were not wealthy!) So I went to school at the kitchen table, largely taught myself after the first few grades (because my "working" mother was way too busy), and did fine - never got a B in high school. Unchallenging classrooms and the tendency to teach to the middle so that both the students who could do much more are left unchallenged doomed to spin their wheels while the students who need more attention and assistance are equally ignored. I do not think that home schooling would be worse for the students who are not challenged. I suppose that a classroom like that is good for that band in the middle that the teacher is focusing on. The bright can coast and develop poor study habits and the students who need more are left stuggling with a sense of failure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="354">My daughter, who had amzingly taught herself to read in pre-kindergarden, was refused entry into the gifted and talented program since that would upset the "balance" in the classroom and coasted by until she dropped out of school. Frankly I only wish that I had home-schooled her. She could not possibly be worse off educationally than she is now... Although a product of a public school education, a supporter of public schools, and one who sent my own kids to public schools, I can sympathize with lefty parents who have given up on them for their children. Almost all of the reforms of the past generation, although usually well-meaning, have been misguided at best, and have failed to improve the educational experiences of children even when they have had modest impacts on test scores. I fear we are raising generations of kids who know how to pass tests, but who hate to engage with meaningful learning. Interestingly, American public school test results have always fallen somewhere in the middle of the pack when compared to other countries, and yet American public schools have produced far more than their share of leaders in science, technology, business, culture, politics and scholarship.</paragraph><paragraph parID="355">Perhaps test scores don't reveal the learning that really matters for success. Meanwhile, as our social patterns have become increasingly segregated by income levels and we've become socially isolated into like-minded groups, middle-class parents have become obsessively anxious about their kids' success and far too protective of them. the best i can say about this article is that it brings the subject of children's education choices into the limelight for learning and debate. but to take poor examples of homeschooling and homeschooler parents and compare those with great examples of public schools is so misleading. there are good and bad of all types of kids education systems, whether standard public schools, private schools, church-run schools, parent-run schools, "schools without walls", alternative schools and homeschooling. the homeschooled years never did her any harm and built up her confidence significantly as she could choose the theme of what she wanted to learn and she got one on one attention from a variety of family members and outsider. U.S. schools are suffering for many different reasons, and a big one is social issues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="356">Home schooling can eliminate many irresponsible policies found in public schools along with taking kids out of social chaos in many communities. I, myself, saw much chaos and lack of social standards and extremely poor behavior supported or ignored by parents. The flip side of homeschooling is the possibility of the parent/parents injecting far more prejudice and political attitudes than would be found in a classroom. Homeschooled kids, though, can and do engage in social activities and sports outside the home. One of the best learning environments I ever saw was in a community type commune that schooled all children on site. There were maybe 13 kids receiving hands on lessons and an environment that provided an automatic laboratory for leaning science - learning combustion, for instance, by cooking their lunch over a fire and seeing what is involved in that process. In other words, the private school is cheaper than it would be if it didn't have to pay for those things.</paragraph><paragraph parID="357">The private school doesn't need to worry about too many children with special needs either, since it's fully funded by parents who can afford it. People I know home school kids until it is time for high school and then send them to regular school for socializing. When they wanted to put the older one into the public school system, the school district insisted on putting him inot his age group, which was two years behind where his schooling was. That would be ideal, Billy. Too much variety in hundreds of communities throughout the country. It is mind boggling how complicated it is and how too many corporations and churches and others, are involved in batting education around. It is also difficult to enforce some policies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="358">We live in a huge country with hundreds and hundreds of schools. The national school board used to play a big part in determining curricula. Goldstein writes: "Over the past year, there has been a resurgence of interest in homeschooling - not just the religious fundamentalist variety practiced by Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum, but also in secular, liberal homeschooling." Critics often argue that homeschooling keeps children from socializing with a diverse group of peers. Liberals, Don't Homeschool Your Kids s a child growing up in Arizona and Georgia college towns during the 1980s and 1990s, the filmmaker Astra Taylor was "unschooled" by her lefty, countercultural parents. "My siblings and I slept late and never knew what day of the week it was," Taylor writes in a new essay in the literary journal N+1 .</paragraph><paragraph parID="359">"We were never tested, graded, or told to memorize dates, facts, or figures. ... Some days we read books, made music, painted, or drew. Other days we argued and fought over the computer. Endless hours were spent watching reruns of 'The Simpsons' on videotape, though we had every episode memorized. When we weren't inspired - which was often - we simply did nothing at all." Over the past year, there has been a resurgence of interest in homeschooling - not just the religious fundamentalist variety practiced by Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum, but also in secular, liberal homeschooling like Taylor's. Think no textbooks, history lessons about progressive social movements, and college-level math for precocious 13-year-olds.</paragraph><paragraph parID="360">Some families implement this vision on their own, while others join cooperatives of like-minded, super-involved parents. Homeschooling is so unevenly regulated from state to state that it is impossible to know exactly how many homeschoolers there are. Estimates range from about 1 million to 2 million children, and the number is growing. It is unclear how many homeschooling families are secular, but the political scientist Rob Reich has written that there is little doubt the homeschooling population has diversified in recent years. * Yet whether liberal or conservative, "[o]ne article of faith unites all homeschoolers: that homeschooling should be unregulated," Reich writes. "Homeschoolers of all stripes believe that they alone should decide how their children are educated." Could such a go-it-alone ideology ever be truly progressive - by which I mean, does homeschooling serve the interests not just of those who are doing it, but of society as a whole?</paragraph><paragraph parID="361">Drawing upon her own upbringing, as well as on the traditions of the radical private school the Albany Free School , Taylor calls on parents and students to "empty the schools," which force students to endure "irrational authority six and a half hours a day, five days a week, in a series of cinder-block holding cells," she caricatures. This overheated hostility toward public schools runs throughout the new literature on liberal homeschooling, and reveals what is so fundamentally illiberal about the trend: It is rooted in distrust of the public sphere, in class privilege, and in the dated presumption that children hail from two-parent families, in which at least one parent can afford (and wants) to take significant time away from paid work in order to manage a process - education - that most parents entrust to the community at-large. Take, for instance, Sonia Songha's New York Times account of forming a preschool cooperative with six other brownstone-Brooklyn mothers, all of whom "said our children had basically never left our sides." Indeed, in a recent Newsweek report , the education journalist Linda Perlstein noted a significant number of secular homeschoolers are also adherents of attachment parenting , the perennially controversial ideology defined by practices such as co-sleeping with one's child and breast-feeding for far longer than typical, sometimes well beyond toddlerhood. Meanwhile, in suburban New Jersey, one "hippy" homeschooler told the local paper she feared exposing her kids to the presumably negative influences of teachers and peers. "I didn't want my child being raised by someone else for eight hours out of the day," she said. Recent reports of teachers and teachers' aides in Los Angeles and New York molesting children only flame the fans of such fears.</paragraph><paragraph parID="362">But these stories make news exactly because they are so rare; there's something creepy about giving in totally to the terrors of the outside world harming one's child. In a country increasingly separated by cultural chasms - Christian conservatives vs. secular humanists; Tea Partiers vs. Occupiers - should we really encourage children to trust only their parents or those hand-selected by them, and to mistrust civic life and public institutions? Moreover, being your child's everything - her parent, teacher, baby-sitter, and afterschool program coordinator - requires a massive outlay of labor. Songha's pre-K cooperative hired a teacher, but parents ended up putting in 10 to 12 hours of work per week administrating the program. Astra Taylor's father was a college professor, while her mother supervised the four children's "unschooling." What goes unmentioned is what made this lifestyle possible: the fact that Taylor's mother could afford to stay home with her kids. Yet Taylor bristles against the suggestion that there was anything unique about the ability of her upper-middle class, uber-intellectual parents to effectively "unschool" their children while still helping them grow into educated adults with satisfying professional lives.</paragraph><paragraph parID="363">This critique "implies that most people are not gifted, and that they need to be guided, molded, tested, and inspected," Taylor complains. "What makes us so sure most people couldn't handle self-education?" What makes us so sure? Reality. More than 70 percent of mothers with children under the age of 18 are in the workforce. One-third of all children and one-half of low-income children are being raised by a single parent . Fewer than one-half of young children, and only about one-third of low-income kids, are read to daily by an adult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="364">Surely, this isn't the picture of a nation ready to "self-educate" its kids. Nor can we allow homeschoolers to believe their choice impacts only their own offspring. Although the national school-reform debate is fixated on standardized testing and "teacher quality" - indeed, the uptick in secular homeschooling may be, in part, a backlash against this narrow education agenda - a growing body of research suggests "peer effects" have a large impact on student achievement. Low-income kids earn higher test scores when they attend school alongside middle-class kids, while the test scores of privileged children are impervious to the influence of less-privileged peers. So when college-educated parents pull their kids out of public schools, whether for private school or homeschooling, they make it harder for less-advantaged children to thrive. Of course, no one wants to sacrifice his own child's education in order to better serve someone else's kid. But here's the great thing about attending racially and socioeconomically integrated schools: It helps children become better grown-ups.</paragraph><paragraph parID="365">Research by Columbia University sociologist Amy Stuart Wells found that adult graduates of integrated high schools shared a commitment to diversity, to understanding and bridging cultural differences, and to appreciating "the humanness of individuals across racial lines." Taylor admits that "[m]any people, liberal and conservative alike, are deeply offended by critiques of compulsory schooling." I suppose I am one of them. I benefited from 13 years of public education in one of the most diverse and progressive school districts in the United States. My father, stepmother, stepfather, and grandfather are or were public school educators. As an education journalist, I've admired many public schools that use culturally relevant, high-standards curricula to engage even the most disadvantaged students. These schools are sustained by the talents of impossibly hard-working teachers who want to partner with parents and kids, not oppress them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="366">Despite our conflicting perspectives, I agree with Taylor that school ought to be more engaging, more intellectually challenging, and less obsessed with testing . But government is the only institution with the power and scale to intervene in the massive undertaking of better educating American children, 90 percent of whom currently attend public schools. (And it's worth remembering that schools provide not just education, but basic child care while parents are at work.) Lefty homeschoolers might be preaching sound social values to their children, but they aren't practicing them. If progressives want to improve schools, we shouldn't empty them out. We ought to flood them with our kids, and then debate vociferously what they ought to be doing. We are concerned about a recent drift towards vitriol in the RSN Reader comments section.</paragraph><paragraph parID="367">There is a fine line between moderation and censorship. No one likes a harsh or confrontational forum atmosphere. At the same time everyone wants to be able to express themselves freely. We'll start by encouraging good judgement. If that doesn't work we'll have to ramp up the moderation. General guidelines: Avoid personal attacks on other forum members; Avoid remarks that are ethnically derogatory; Do not advocate violence, or any illegal activity. "Kids... need the professional guidance... which trained educators are best suited to provide.</paragraph><paragraph parID="368">Parents can supplement but not replace it." My reply to both statements is this: what if the parent is a better qualified teacher than those employed in your child's school? This is hardly a moot point, given the poor quality of teachers we have here compared to those in Finland and other nations (e.g., in the US, the average teacher's SAT scores are below average for all SAT takers!) It is especially relevant in places like my own home town, which has seen the quality of its schools and teachers steadily plummet over the past 2 decades. Our daughter is in 7th grade, and while her English and Social Studies teachers are good, her Math and Science teachers have impressed us as complacent, lazy, and embarrassingly unskilled and unknowledgeable . So, our reason for considering homeschooling - at least for math and science - is not to have absolute autonomy over her curriculum, but to actually teach our daughter the existing curriculum well. As a math and science teacher myself, I'm not just sure that I could outperform her current teachers in those subjects, but I'm quite sure most people who'd passed Algebra II and HS Science classes could outperform them as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="369">Rick Levy, Attachment parenting, wow, I find that is a bit of a stretch. Keep in mind that the author has a horse in the race: her family has deep roots as educators! I believe that home schooling has shown that students gain more autonomy in a home schooled setting. They have more initiative and I would suspect better critical thinking skills. In a standard public school it seems more like following your sheep, keeping up with the Jones and the constant competition for approval from peers, etc etc. My own experience was mediocre but in college I easily graduated Magna Cum Laude... I guess in HS I didn't have a good enough last name or the reputation to gain higher grades however in math I had no problems other than some "popular" kids accusing me of cheating. No wonder we are falling behind other countries, not JUST China and India.</paragraph><paragraph parID="370">This is crazy. As the article stated Children need other contacts than their parents to grow up to be well rounded human beings. Very few parents have enough education and objectivity to teach their own children, and if there is NO testing we will end up with a poorly educated population. The religious right will grow even more intolerant and narrow minded. If very well to do mothers, who can afford not to work, keep their children home, only low income family children and lower middle class kids will go to school, and as stated, they will lack healthy competition with more fortunate kids. What a mess. We keep going downhill America sure seems to be going backwards</paragraph><paragraph parID="371">Testing does NOT make good students. Challenge and encouragement makes good students. Quality education makes good students. Testing, as done under "No Child Left Behind", is NOT quality education. School districts are realizing this, and are dropping out of NCLB. Progressive, I may not have expressed myself clearly enough. The testing done in the "no child left behind" program is excessive and crazy for teaching kids to take tests, doesn't impart knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph parID="372">But if kids are home schooled. There should be periodic testing to see that they are actually learning. My three children all went to public schools and they were good students. They were self motivated and they knew what my husband and I expected of them. But we kept an eye on their work, to make sure they were where they should be. At dinner time we would have quizzes about capitals of the states, and capitals of the world, so learning was a fun thing. At 23 my son was very successful and had his own business, before he was killed in a plane crash.</paragraph><paragraph parID="373">Both my daughters are successful also. My oldest has expanded the business I started, and is now the owner. My youngest is a CPA and certified financial planner, and she now has two partners. So public school sure can do an excellent job of teaching, but parents should always be up on their children's work, and help where needed. This article left me feeling ambivalent. I consider myself both a harsh critic and a staunch supporter of public schools. If my daughter hated school, I'd take her out.</paragraph><paragraph parID="374">But she likes it -- at least enough of it to put up with what she doesn't like. There are few things more urgent than improving our public schools, and getting them out of the corporate stranglehold of testing and more testing. But I wouldn't presume to ask someone else to sacrifice their child to that struggle. Contrary to stereotypes, home schooled children consistently are shown to be more socially engaged than their publicly schooled peers. Overall, they also average stronger academic achievement. I agree that "homeschooling" (and even formal private schooling) is a very regressive idea, but it will be considered by many who can afford it so long as public schools seem inadequate. One-third of all children and one-half of low-income children are being raised by a single parent. "</paragraph><paragraph parID="375">it's 1) building on a child's strengths rather than mostly focusing on their weaknesses 2) provide learning experiences that build confidence and enjoyment in learning 3) share opportunities for the child to do research and problem-solve in their own way. 4) promote open-minded, flexible and diverse values with enriched opportunities for learning experiences. homeschooling parents do not need degrees or high IQs to do these things -- just a good attitude. Few parents are capable of doing even an acceptable job of homeschooling. Because class sizes are too large locally to give individual attention to students, I've recently done some individual coaching in algebra, geometry and physical science. What they don't know, they can learn, and then teach their children. Or they can learn it together with their child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="376">Or they can join or create a group of diversely educated adults to educate their children together. a more wholesome and long-lasting method is to inspire the kids to find out about subjects that interest them and help them use libraries, the net and hands-on ways to determine the answers to problems chosen by each kid. Remember, some of the best minds we know of were home-schooled: http://www.tjed-mothers.com/2009/11/important-and-famous-people-who-were.html. Unfortunately, the American school system is consistently failing our young people which has motivated many parents to find another way to educate their children. Pontificating about the social wellbeing of society does not cut it with parents who are protecting their children from what has become a hostile, toxic, and disfunctional environment in many of the public schools. A homeschooling teacher said that her 'first draft' is like the final edit! All of the parents I know that have chosen to homeschool are not too attached to their children; they find avenues to expose their children to others and more importantly didn't decide to homeschool because they wanted to be around their kids all day, as Goldstein makes it seem.</paragraph><paragraph parID="377">Although many parents may be homeschooling for what may be perceived as the "wrong reasons" many of us just want our children to attend decent schools where they will learn. If just all had less "desires" developed, less employment would have been needed, and the kids would have gotten smarter by being Homeschooled Public teachers represent the largest unionized group in the country. Unfortunately, the teachers teach to their own benefits, rather than to learning outcomes. As I tried to stay involved in his education, and in school committees, I was subjected to arrogant dismissal. At a strategic planning meeting, one (otherwise smart) teacher opined that the falling test scores reflected students' declining intelligence Finally, the chicks are coming home to roost as the public education system collapses. Sooner or later these homeschooled kids will as adults have to be integrated into the larger society and economy!!</paragraph><paragraph parID="378">I've been amazed at the quality of the teachers. and the depth of the material they are covering. They are learning tolerance, compassion, team work, and respect for each other's differences -- as well as all of the stuff kids in school buildings learn. Teaching 4 classes of 30 kids does not does not lend itself to providing the kinds of motivating experiential learning that my 9 year-old grandson gets. MAYBE, if our educational system were revamped to be more student-centered, maybe if all parents taught their kids tolerance, compassion, respect for others etc. etc., kids like my grandson would be able to intellectually and emotionally thrive in the system as he does as a home-schooler. sharing the teaching with other family members and outsiders makes homeschooling even better (it's what we did with my daughter). but even non-professional, non-college-educated parents can do this well, as long as they have a love of learning and an openness to find out how best to do it, to share with kids and learn together.</paragraph><paragraph parID="379">Parents have a right to be concerned about their children attending schools that are failing. My children are grown (the attended private school) because I knew that they would get a mediocre education in public school--as I did when I attended NYC public schools. Everyday we hear about children getting hurt or being bullied in public schools because the administration has been stripped of their ability to take action which means removing disruptive students. Sad to say public school classes have to move slowly to accommodate the slower learners in the class. It is the right and responsibility of every parent to protect their children and prepare them in the best way possible to have a fulfilling and productive life. To ask parents to "throw their children to the wolves" by sending them to public schools is misguided. Until the schools can get their act together, they will see more and more parents making alternative choices.</paragraph><paragraph parID="380">It is possible that public schools will have to find a place to educate the students who are disruptive, violent, pushing drugs, and pulling everyone else down. I found that "schooling" public or private suppresses the genius of our children. They chose to homeschool because they really wanted their child to have opportunities that public schools cannot give. RALEIGH &#65533; Public school parents and homeschoolers alike may be wondering what to think of one of the latest ideas to hit the school-choice arena: public charter schools for home-schoolers. These schools aren&#65533;t yet a real presence in North Carolina, but there is enough evidence of how homeschool charters and &#65533;virtual&#65533; charters operate in Alaska and California to gain some insight into their attractiveness as well as their drawbacks. The California Home Education Program appeals to homeschool families on its &#65533;Who We Are&#65533; web page by noting that &#65533;parents who wish to home school benefit from support. Even though homeschooling is legal in California, in 2002 the Chino Valley, Galt Joint Union, and Morengo Unified school districts contacted parents who had filed the required private-school affidavits, according to the Home School Legal Defense Association.</paragraph><paragraph parID="381">Although Alaska has one of the best homeschool laws in the nation, 75 percent of homeschool families enrolled in the state&#65533;s publicly supported homeschool programs. In 2002, Alaska required homeschool students enrolled in public correspondence schools to take the statewide assessment test, and to have it monitored and graded by a state-certified teacher. Alaskan homeschool students in these programs now have a mandatory conference with a certified teacher, minus parent, at least once a month. The vast majority,&#65533; he said, &#65533;have pursued home education in search of academic benefits or the opportunity to raise their children in the framework of the parents&#65533; religious or philosophical beliefs (of whatever type)&#65533; rendering meaningless the notion that homeschoolers are just holding out for a better package from government education. The draw of these arrangements is that parents can &#65533;home-school&#65533; at virtually no cost to the family. But support may come with significant strings attached, said Michael Smith, president of the Home School Legal Defense Association of Purcelville, Va. Our organization believes that is the right and duty of the parents to direct the education of their children, by whatever method seems appropriate,&#65533; including the public schools, as long as parents believe that the school meets the child&#65533;s needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="382">Through charter and virtual charter schools, CHEP supplies textbooks, lesson plans, oversight via certified teachers, testing, grading, student-teacher and parent-teacher conferences, as well as computers, Internet access, and software. As a result, the California Department of Education has made programs like CHEP more attractive by threatening homeschool families with interference by the state. Alaska initially offered a package to homeschool parents that included texts of their choice, plus computers and Internet access in some grades. Here are more reasons why the benefits to homeschooling vs public schooling lead me to agree with Award winning teacher John Taylor Gatto that schools are not a good place for your kids. From the first month of my teaching career of 30 years, I realized that intellectual power, creative insight, and good character was being diminished in my classroom." One look at the activities we have done with William and Catherine will show you that homeschooling is of a fundamentally different nature than anything that could be attempted through public schools. You can follow the interests of your child, wherever they may lead.</paragraph><paragraph parID="383">"Schools cling more and more stubbornly to their mistaken idea that education and teaching are industrial processes , to be designed and planned from above in the minutest detail and then imposed on passive teachers and their even more passive students." "It is only in the presence of loving, respectful, trusting adults ...that children will learn all they are capable of learning, or reveal to us what they are learning." In fact, the very nature of public schooling means they cannot compete with the benefits to homeschooling. You'll see that having a close-knit family is one of the many homeschooling benefits that come from not sending your child to school. The Benefits To Home School If you think that's going too far, look at what John Gatto goes on to say: "If they are swarmed by friends and win every award the place can offer, it changes nothing .</paragraph><paragraph parID="384">(John Taylor Gatto, Weapons of Mass Instruction ) Would you be able to teach a class with up to 30 children how to build a robot? Or run a dinosaurs for kids class activity for schools lasting two years for 7-13 year-olds covering the entire history of Life on Earth ? Besides which, something should have struck you. The activities sound fun , don't they? And that's one of the overwhelming benefits to homeschooling. Look at John Taylor Gatto again:</paragraph><paragraph parID="385">"I taught for thirty years in some of the worst schools in Manhattan, and in some of the best, and during that time I became an expert in boredom ," he says. "Boredom was everywhere in my world, and if you asked the kids, as I often did, why they felt so bored, they always gave me the same answers: They said the work was stupid , that it made no sense, that they already knew it...They said teachers didn't seem to know much about their subjects and clearly weren't interested in learning more. And the kids were right: their teachers were every bit as bored as they were." Benefits To Homeschooling vs Public Schools If you look at the About Me page, you'll see that I was homeschooled for the first eleven years of my life and the world seemed a fantastic place. Watching the ruthless efficiency with which High School demolished almost every subject it put on the blackboard is one of the main reasons I decided to avoid schools and enjoy the advantages of homeschooling with William and Catherine. So what is it about homeschooling vs public schooling which makes schools so bad ?</paragraph><paragraph parID="386">It ignores the way children learn. Look at the wisdom of another iconic figure, John Holt : And, if you need to hear the best endorsement ever of the benefits to homeschooling, look at what he says: "We need to realize (that)... no two people are alike , all 'averages' are lies, and nobody can be accurately contained by numbers and graphs." Benefits to Homeschooling You can see what I mean by allowing your kids to set the agenda if you have a look at our free homeschooling curriculum . You won't see standard public schooling lesson plans, targets, achievement scores.</paragraph><paragraph parID="387">But, as you travel to the rainforest with homeschool science or join our ocean creatures for kids projects, you'll see we can use all the benefits of homeschooling to teach science in a completely different way. You'll find the fundamental difference between homeschooling vs public schooling in our home are the homeschooling methods we use. Schools teach top-down; our homeschooling is, as much as possible, bottom-up. It's William and Catherine who have shown us the benefits to homeschooling by getting us learning how to draw a dragon or finding out how to make an ocean diorama . For us, it's about the benefits of learning together , trying things out, seeing what works and encouraging interests. It's meant we've covered all sorts of education no public schooling could ever encompass. It's exciting, fulfilling and often challenging.</paragraph><paragraph parID="388">Scary isn't it? What I'm saying is that mass public schooling has got it wrong . It does its best, there are lots of very good teachers and very good schools, but fundamentally it cannot compete. Schools are also dangerous: "By supporting school-imposed order, however innocently, parents make enemies of their own children, sometimes lifelong enemies." The debate over homeschooling vs public schooling has led many people to question what effect schools have on our children. If you want to know more about John Holt and why he became so disillusioned with public schooling, Wikipedia tells you all about his life and why his book: Teach Your Own, became the textbook of the early homeschooling movement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="389">Homeschooling vs public schooling is one of the most important issues that affects you and your children; I hope I've let the cat out of the bag, made you question whether public schools are best and shown you that you do have a choice . We were very excited (and continue to be) to be able to teach our children according to the curriculum, values, and schedule that reflect our family. Homeschooling works for us right now because we can teach our children more efficiently and with more individual attention than they could ever get in a classroom full of 30 other kids. Yes, there are things in the public schools that we want to shelter our young children from in the years when their minds are very impressionable, but we don't think it is impossible to deprogram a child from any undesirable instruction acquired at school. Audience Soapbox: Homeschooling is Not the Gospel One of the things we encountered first-hand during our rookie year is the homeschool culture. The speaker's name is not important, but his 45-minute message was a glimpse into the worldview of (I fear) many Christian homeschooling families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="390">Everyone acknowledges that the public school system in American needs reforming. It is producing graduates that are less and less prepared for the workforce, college, and the global marketplace. Public schooling was portrayed as useless, enslaving, stupifying, and monopolizing. The funny thing is that EVERYONE in the room (including the speaker) was educated in the public school system! (It didn't seem to terribly fail us.) According to the speaker, it is home-educating your kids. This is apparently obvious, given his examples of historical geniuses who lived during eras without public education (Thomas Jefferson, medieval scholars, etc).</paragraph><paragraph parID="391">He didn't spend too much time on this subject since he probably assumed that he didn't need to convert any in the audience since we were all homeschoolers already. But he did say that homeschooling alone would not save our country and Western culture from the dumbing down of public school graduates. My wife and I decided to educate our children ourselves not because we believe the public school system is evil and hopelessly beyond repair. I suspect that many, many homeschool families are not of the militant variety as well. If we were all likeminded, we wouldn't need a pep talk at the annual homeschool rally. I'm inclined to believe that the institution of public schooling is a common grace in our society (and many other societies as well). Really, can anyone believe after serious reflection that society would be best served if public schooling disappeared next fall?</paragraph><paragraph parID="392">Would every child hence receive a better quality education in expensive private schools, or fledgeling homeschools? Would every family forced to homeschool without the option of public education give as systematic an education to their children as purposeful homeschool families do today? Homeschooling is NOT the gospel! We love having her home, we are thrilled at the results of her education so far, and will likely never send her to public school. This article makes it appear that facilitating positive socialisation is extra to a teachers role, so therefore can one deduce that a teachers main function is teaching and the rest perhaps is what they have to do because parents don't? This article states that schools are imperative in developing peer relationship skills and then goes on to say Children require help from adults if they are to overcome serious peer relationship problems.</paragraph><paragraph parID="393">So, put them in schools until they have a problem and then let us sort it out. Social Skills and Satisfaction with Social Relationships in Home-Schooled, Private-Schooled, and Public-Schooled Children Abstract: Despite the fact that 1.5 to 2.1 million children are home-schooled, there is limited research on the impact of home-schooling on children's social skills. This study compares 53 home-schooled, 49 private-schooled, and 48 public-schooled children between the ages of 8 and 12 on social skills, as measured by the Parent and Student Forms of the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS). In addition, the groups' satisfaction with social relationships were compared using the Peer Network and Dyadic Loneliness Scale (PNDLS), the Loneliness and Social Dissatisfaction Questionnaire (LSDQ), and the Friendship Qualities Scale (FQS). There were significant differences between the home-schooled children and private-schooled children on the SSRS-Student Form and between home-schooled children and the public-schooled children on the FQS. An illegal activity in some states just 10 years ago, homeschooling has become legal and increasingly popular throughout the United States.</paragraph><paragraph parID="394">Although homeschooling may satisfy parents' desire to customize education for their children, such customization has its perils. The author argues that customizing a child's education through homeschooling represents the victory of a consumer mentality within education, as if the purpose of education were to please and satisfy the preferences of the consumer. Also, customizing education through homeschooling compromises citizenship in several important ways, including potential lack of exposure to people with beliefs different from one's own, sharing common experiences and values, and exercising freedom to choose among a range of possibilities. The author argues that we should not allow a new consumer mentality to become the driving metaphor for the education of children. For those new to the situation in Germany: home educating is (perceived as) illegal. The common citation for forced school attendance is to protect against parallel societies. Other sources also attest to high literacy rates prior to the 1900s, a literacy that arose largely from homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="395">In 2001, for example, homeschooled SAT-takers averaged 568 on the verbal test and 525 on the math; the national average was 506 on verbal and 514 on math. If public schools, with all their advantages, cannot compete with free market options, then they deserve to weaken because children deserve better. (Often the income and careers of these advocates depend upon the continued tax funding of public schools.) Is there any validity to their criticism of educational alternatives? Two of the most viable ones are homeschooling and apprenticeships. How could anyone reasonably object to that? One objection comes from the assumption that public schools are necessary for children to become literate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="396">The assumption is unfounded. Prior to the spread of public education in the early 1900s, literacy rates in America were amazingly high. A much-quoted estimate comes from a book written in 1812 at the behest of Thomas Jefferson. The French statesman Pierre Samuel DuPont de Nemours, who emigrated to America, declared of young Americans, "Not more than four in a thousand are unable to write legibly, even neatly." Pointing to the past is unnecessary. Moreover, nations that actively encourage apprenticeship programs such as Germany and Switzerland enjoy very high literacy. Two additional criticisms of educational alternatives are common.</paragraph><paragraph parID="397">First, alternatives weaken the public school system; and second, they harm children. The first argument assumes that dissenting parents should support and strengthen a social institution they believe damages their children. Their "social obligations" are placed in conflict with their parental responsibilities. No such conflict exists. The second criticism is that educational alternatives harm children. In the '80s, when homeschooling appeared on the social radar, it was closely associated with the Religious Right. The accusation of harm shifted.</paragraph><paragraph parID="398">This was the message clearly implied by an Oct. 14 CBS News two-part report entitled "A Dark Side to Homeschooling." The report created a furor of protest in the homeschooling community; it also encouraged politicians to call for anti-homeschooling legislation. Conservative columnist Michelle Malkin examined a push for legislation in New Jersey. Four adopted boys were found to be starving although child welfare officials claimed to have visited the home no fewer than 38 times. Rather than condemn the bureaucracy, politicians blamed the fact that the foster parents had homeschooled. With apprenticeships, the concept of harm often draws upon the specter of "child labor" even though modern apprenticeships bear no resemblance to the 19th century images that arise at the sound of that term. Apprentices entering programs in the U.S., for instance, must be at least 16 years old.</paragraph><paragraph parID="399">Moreover, apprenticeship as alternative education was established as a matter of parental and religious liberty by the court case Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972). The case addressed the Amish and Mennonite tradition by which children were employed from age 14 to 16 on the family farm or in a family occupation, like carpentry, instead of going to school as the law usually requires. The court found that such employment did not constitute harm. Today, these apprenticeships remain a de facto exception to child labor laws and open the door to other exceptions. Apprenticeships, experiments like Montessori and the School of Living, self-guided education, mentoring ... The cost of public education is not measured in tax dollars alone. But academic excellence is not the only reason to exit the public school system. This is why, in every nation, the government requires attendance at schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="400">It then taxes people to fund these schools. The handful of schools that it does not fund it regulates. The schools that it does not regulate are so few in number that the government ignores them. Hanging out constantly with other children teaches you only how to behave like a barbaric child. This is why civilized people build education and training around apprenticeships, home schooling, and other systems that involve close association between adults and children." If you're concerned that homeschooling will inhibit your children socially, compare the suicide statistics of homeschoolers versus public schooled kids. I'm not sure if homeschooling parents have to stick to the exact same curriculum as the surrounding school district, but not sticking to it may not be such a bad thing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="401">After, if I remember correctly, five years of unsatisfactory standardized test scores, the school is closed down and is re-opened as a charter school. The only pitfall I can see is parents neglecting to teach some worthwhile topics (evolution, Koch's postulates, radioactivity, and the Big Bang Theory were things that were not gone over when I was in high school, and my high school was a nationally exemplary school), but what kind of parent would not want their kids to be full of knowledge? In John Stossel's book "Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity," he says that the 'freedom' that everybody thinks public school teachers have in their classroom is bull. It is true that under the one-size-fits-all constraints of NCLB, teachers have next to no latitude in what content to deliver to students. Under NCLB, schools are not converted to charter schools after five years of bad scores. What actually happens (at least in California) is that schools that have failed to meet testing 'growth targets' for three consecutive years go into 'program improvement' status. Continued failure to meet targets results in a school being taken over by the state, who then exercise far-reaching discretionary powers to revamp faculty, administration, and curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="402">The school in our district with the highest academic performance index (API) score (excluding two small, necessary schools with abnormally low student/teacher ratios)ranks in the 90th percentile of similar schools state-wide (they scored 865 this past year; 800 is the state-wide target), yet because they failed to meet their growth targets for three consecutive years, they are now in year two of program improvement. Purely aside from being a subject many students have little interest in, our state-mandated curriculum limits the content of this otherwise enormous field of study to only three topics: chemistry, physics, and astronomy. Sure, we pay a high price, namely we are still taxed for public schools, but the freedom to homeschool should be fought for tooth-and-nail at every level of our wretched government. I'm a non-Christian libertarian, and while I have not yet found a wife or gotten myself a couple of rugrats, I can assure you, they will definitely be home-schooled. Homeschooling is still legal here in Kansas, but not so everywhere in the USA... I believe in Colorado you are required to have a teaching degree in order to home school your own children. "Christopher Klicka, senior counsel for the Home School Legal Defense Association, a nonprofit group based in Virginia, said polls showed that a majority of home-school parents remained wary of letting their children participate in public school activities. But as earlier battles over the right to home schooling fade from memory, that attitude is likely to change, he said.       '</paragraph><paragraph parID="403">The further we get from those early days, when there was real persecution, the more people will forget,' Mr. Klicka said. ' And they will want equal access more.'" Surely this is tantamount to these homeschoolers saying that homeschooling doesn't work -- just what the anti-homeschool people need to turn the system back against homeschooling! How long will it be before the states which allow homeschoolers to take part in some public school activities turn around and *require* them to be part of *all* the activities ("goodbye homeschooling")? From "Homeschooling mother of four" (1972-1987): RE: TV's Law &amp;amp; Order: "Homeschool mom orders son to kill his little brother" Although the word "Christian" was not used in the part I saw, it was obvious the family was Christian (the names of the boys, the reference to heaven, etc., but not the mother's attitude). Your main point (if I can be forgiven for generalising) appears to be that the government at many, if not all levels, is targeting home-scholars because they don&#65533;t fit in to a mould that those in power would seem to want.</paragraph><paragraph parID="404">Home-schooled children are, by the nature of their education, more fundamentally inclined that those educated in a school environment: taught from only one point of view, by one person, they are naturally going to have a stronger tenacity when it comes to beliefs. Anita Kosovic pulled her son Nathaniel, now 10, out of school at the end of June 2002 because he was unhappy with his peers, most of whom, she says, were kids with behavioural problems. So, at the start of the new school year in September, Nathaniel began learning at home, through the U-Connect Program offered by the Langley, B.C., school district. Every week, her son spent an hour-and-a-half at a nearby public school for extracurricular activities, her family received about $600 to help pay for supplies and books, and she could give her son the attention he needed and determine the appropriate curriculum for him. Only she couldn't. Because in January, sixteen months after starting the UConnect program, Kosovic discovered that, in the eyes of the B.C. government, Nathaniel is actually a ward of the public system, even though the majority of his learning occurs at home with his mother. Under U-Connect, Kosovic is merely a "facilitator," according to the B.C. Ministry of Education, not his primary teacher.</paragraph><paragraph parID="405">And Langley isn't the only district where the phrase "homeschooling" is being co-opted by public boards. About 146 families with Abbotsford Electronic School (AES)--a distance education program which, according to the school district's website, "links Home Schoolers with Ministry of Education courses"--are also technically under the control of the public board. The upshot is that parents who believed they would be able to fully direct their children's education are now being told what they can and cannot teach. Specifically, says Kosovic, she has been ordered not to use faith-based teaching materials as part of the curriculum. "They can't tell me what to teach in my own home," she says. In B.C., homeschoolers who want to independently control their children's education--religious content included or not--can. All they need to do is register--inform a school board that they will be educating their children autonomously in accordance with sections 12 and 13 of the B.C. School Act--and be willing to settle for far less in terms of funding.</paragraph><paragraph parID="406">On the other hand, if children are "enrolled," they are known as "home-based" students. They are required to follow the B.C. provincial curriculum, and receive a provincial diploma upon graduation. The pupil also brings almost $5,500 worth of provincial funding to the enrolling school, while a district receives only $250 per homeschooled child. When a cap on distance learning enrollment levels was lifted in September 2002, school districts were inundated with applicants for Internet-enabled education programs. And with the funding that followed, the boards were more than eager to oblige--perhaps a little too eager. Kosovic says she only signed up after being assured she would be considered her child's primary teacher. Home educators in the U.S. say that Canadian parents are finding out what they've known for years: that affiliating kids in any way with public schools enables government officials to dictate what parents teach.</paragraph><paragraph parID="407">And experience shows that the more public money parents take, the further state authorities will encroach into the home-based classroom. The often confusing distinction between homeschoolers and kids who are educated at home has been tripping up parents in the U.S. for the last 10 years, says Ann Lahrson Fisher, the Washington State-based news and commentary editor for Home Education Magazine . "Every year, there are angry parents who did not realize they were giving up their child's homeschool status." B.C. programs, such as U-Connect and AES, attract parents because they qualify for more funding--a lot more. About $600 per child, versus the $125 to $200 received by traditional, parent-directed homeschoolers in that province. They also, in effect, make "the home an extension of the public school classroom," explains Corinna Filion, B.C. Education Ministry spokesman. While this is not a new policy, it came as news to B.C. parents recently.</paragraph><paragraph parID="408">An April 22 Vancouver Sun headline squawked, "Religious materials banned for B.C. home schooling." The story went on to say that "homeschooling parents were fuming" after they were ordered by the B.C. Education Ministry to stop using faith-based materials and "unofficial" resources at home. In reality, it wasn't homeschooling parents being affected at all, but, rather, parents like Kosovic, whose children, learning through distance education at home, are considered enrolled in the public system. The latest draft of the proposed revised Alberta home education regulation, due to be enacted later this year, makes a distinction between children doing public school work at home, and home education delivered by parents, with the former requiring higher levels of accountability and reporting by parents. In the end, parents need to realize the state is required to hold accountable anyone who receives taxpayer dollars, points out the Homeschool Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) in a newsletter to parents. "The flip side of the 'free benefits' coin is not Lady Liberty--it's a door to increased 'accountability checks': certified teacher oversight, curriculum approval, mandatory testing, and sometimes, even home inspections," notes the Virginia-based organization, which has a branch in Medicine Hat, Alta. It adds that such scrutiny essentially squelches what they consider one of the main benefits of home education--the flexibility to accommodate each child's learning style and interests.</paragraph><paragraph parID="409">In the U.S., about 30 states already prohibit public schools and public school-funded programs from using any materials not secular in nature. Some parents think the ban on religious materials is extreme, even with regard to home-based schoolers being monitored by public boards. Paul Jeffrey, a Calgary oil and gas lawyer, and father of four homeschooled children, says that even though home-based learners fall within the public system's authority, it's unnecessary to ban religious lessons. Historically, he notes, governments have disallowed faith in the classroom for fear that it would impose one set of beliefs on children over another. "In the B.C. U-Connect program, any pupils receiving faith-based instruction are receiving it in their homes, not in any group context that might alarm other parents," says Jeffrey, who serves on the Board of Directors of the Alberta Home Education Association. But banning religious materials outright, even when there is no potential risk of offending or influencing anyone outside the family, suggests that, as Jeffrey puts it, the "B.C. government is opposed to children receiving any faith instruction." I expect that, as the years go by, and the work becomes more demanding, we will be spending more time on "paperwork," and our days will probably become more "schoolish," but for now, we appreciate how Time4Learning helps us keep track of all the things we need to learn, but doesn't keep us tied to a desk in order to do so.</paragraph><paragraph parID="410">One objection comes from the assumption that public schools are necessary for children to become literate . What is the Advantage of Homeschooling Your Child? Homeschooling may seem like a new trend in education, but it has been around for a long time. More and more children get their education in the privacy of their own homes with parents as their teachers. The learning experience is focused, scheduled and managed around the family. Many advantages of homeschooling benefit both parent and child. However, the most important factor of all is the parents, because they are the teachers behind effective homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="411">Homeschooling: The Benefit of Personalized Schedules Educating your child or children at home has many advantages. One advantage that parents consider when thinking of this form of education is the flexibility of creating a personalized teaching schedule, one that will benefit both parent and child. In public schools, the school day starts promptly at 8:30; however, for homeschooling, the school day can begin at 10 o clock, letting the personalized time schedule be more in tune with your family. Having a personalized schedule will allow your child to learn when they want to and for as long as they want to. No more mandatory 50-minute lesson plans. Perhaps your child wants to spend more time in English class and less time in Science.</paragraph><paragraph parID="412">With homeschooling, personalized time schedules cater to the child wants and needs. The school day can be several hours per day as opposed to 8 hours of mandatory academic study. The Homeschooling Curriculum Social Studies, Mathematics, Science and Reading are just some of the classroom courses that students have to take in the public and private school systems. However, with homeschooling, education can go outside the classroom to include the environment and the community. With the parent as the educator, a child gets a more rounded education with hands on learning and experience that will complement their book learning. You can balance out the learning experience by including both principles into the curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="413">Educating a child at home means that if a parent wants to instill religious values and morals they can do so without opposition from a principal, a superintendent or a school board. A homeschooled child can uphold their religious beliefs while studying academics. With prayer being removed from the public school system, parents of homeschoolers can start their school day in prayer without the worry of offending anyone, if this is what they opt to do. Homeschooling Opens Doors for Other Interest Due to budget cuts within the public school systems, many school activities are obsolete or do not exist anymore. However, with homeschooling, if a child shows some interest in music, dance, art or cooking, a teaching parent can add these interests to the curriculum as part of the child's education or school day. A homeschooled student can have the opportunity to expand their mind in areas of study that the public or private school systems do not offer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="414">There is not a subject matter or an educational activity that cannot be sought when exploring the avenues of opportunity in homeschooling. There are no limitations in homeschooling, for the sky is the limit when a child shows interest in a particular area. The parent can make sure that the interest is part of the curriculum. Focus Around the Family Another advantage of homeschooling is the fact that this avenue of education is not centered on an overcrowded classroom. There are no classroom disruptions from unruly students. Teaching a child or children at home becomes more personal as opposed to a public or private school where teachers contend with 10-15 or more students per class on a daily basis.</paragraph><paragraph parID="415">Homeschooling brings about a one on one teaching experience for parent and child or children. The student or students get the personalized attention that they need if they are having difficulty in certain academic studies or school activities. They do not have to compete for the teacher's time and attention in a homeschooled setting. With the homeschooling environment, the classroom focus is also on the family, regardless of how many children are taught at home or their ages. It becomes a family thing when doing activities and educational outings. Everyone becomes involved with the experience. Teaching a child or children at home means there will be less bullying to contend with and no metal detectors to have to walk through as they start their school day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="416">The Absence of Peer Pressure A child taught at home may have less problems and worries about dealing with peer pressure and socialization issues. Today in the public school sector, the norm is for everyone to look and dress the same, wearing school uniforms to put everyone at ease as far as status is concern. To look at a uniformed student, you cannot tell if they are from the middle class, the elite or if they come from a poor background. However, in reality, it takes more than a uniform to make a student feel accepted and comfortable in their environment, especially if they are different mentally, emotionally or physically. With the public and private school systems, parents tend to worry about all the negative influence that their child may encounter while socializing in their peer groups. Being educated at home sets a firm foundation of self-esteem, values and moral integrity, a foundation built and regulated by the parent and not by peers or the public school system.</paragraph><paragraph parID="417">Parents have the control over their children and their learning experience. The Learning Experience Another advantage of homeschooling is the fact that with this type of education, the child or children learn at his or her own pace. They can take all the time they need to work out a complicated math problem, or learn a particular subject. With the public school system, everything focuses on a time schedule. A child must move on in any particular subject even when they do not have the understanding of the material. In the homeschooling environment, a child does not have to rush to put the math book away to hurry over to social studies or government class.</paragraph><paragraph parID="418">This kind of situation can be frustrating, bringing about the feeling of inadequacy and lower self-esteem, because they are having trouble keeping up in class or in mastering their school assignments. Homeschooling avoids these situations by allowing the child to move on when they are ready and when they fully understand a particular subject matter. It is perfectly okay if a student needs more time to master a subject matter in homeschooling. It used to be that only the rich and famous homeschooled their children, but not anymore. This form of education is recognized and accepted throughout the United States. The only requirement to get started is that parents must follow state regulations when teaching their children at home.

For more on the importance of keeping homeschooling distinct from public virtual charter schools and other public school programs that operate in students' homes, see WPA's letter to the Wisconsin Legislative Audit Bureau by clicking on Issues and Legislation and then Virtual Charter Schools. Homeschooling is successful because parents take direct responsibility for their children's educations. If public school programs that operate in their students' homes were allowed to claim to be homeschools, the essential nature and practice of homeschooling would be seriously eroded. Parents who began homeschooling their 15-year-old son after 10 years of conventional schooling wrote: "What did you consider the most serious problem your child was having in school?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="424">He was receiving straight A's with very little effort, while really not knowing how to study. Because he was a good student, treated his teachers with respect, and was not an athletic "star," he experienced rejection and ridicule by peers. "What changes did you notice in your child after you began homeschooling?" In his years in public school, he went from a talkative, outgoing child to a shy, withdrawn teenager. Upon homeschooling, he gradually began to come out of his shell. He has assumed leadership in our local support group and has been praised by parents as a good role model for the younger ones. His communication, writing, and studying skills have vastly improved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="425">He is happier!! "What have you done while homeschooling that seemed most helpful to your child?" Removal from negative peers has been the most positive thing for him. We have encouraged him to develop leadership and many outside interests to replace those he had in school. He is learning self-discipline in scheduling his own time. A few weeks ago, my 10-year-old daughter read a short chapter book. That may not be too impressive to you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="426">But for me, it was an exciting breakthrough that brought tears to my eyes. It was another proof that homeschooling works, as well as proof that our current Wisconsin law gives us the freedom necessary to achieve great things. You see, we'd already been homeschooling for many years when my youngest child came along. Her first years were full of doctor visits and surgeries. Her next hurdle was learning to talk. When Liesl was five, a specialist diagnosed a particular genetic abnormality that manifests itself in physical defects, speech difficulties, and learning disabilities. We were told that Liesl would need special education classes and would probably never live independently.</paragraph><paragraph parID="427">Although many doctors and nurses were supportive of our intentions to homeschool Liesl, some "experts" were vehement in their opposition. Some said we just didn't have the expertise needed to provide specialized education. One of the many sad prognoses was that Liesl would not be able to read. Yes, they said, she could learn phonics and be able to decipher a job application at McDonald's. But her comprehension would be minimal, and she would never enjoy the pleasures of curling up with a story book. Even worse, this wasn't just a doctor's worst-case-scenario prediction; it was commonly acknowledged by other parents of kids with this syndrome. Because we were "lacking in expertise," we proceeded to educate her in a way that was NOT in accord with standard operating procedure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="428">Had we lived in a state that required standardized testing or portfolio review or curriculum oversight by the local superintendent, it's very unlikely that we would've been allowed to continue homeschooling the way we did in Wisconsin. A year or so ago, we rejoiced when Liesl began to read easy chapter books. She was not capable of reading a book unless she had previously heard it read aloud more than once. Still, it was progress. And most importantly, she was enjoying these books. I wished she would be able to read new material, too, but it seemed that was not to be. She would try and then give up because the words were senseless.</paragraph><paragraph parID="429">Maybe the experts were right. Maybe her reading comprehension would always be seriously limited. Then a couple of weeks ago, I read aloud a "Russell" book. It wasn't long, only 1.5 hours for the whole story. She wanted more. But I had work to do, and my voice box was wearing out. An hour later, I discovered that Liesl was two-thirds of the way through a different "Russell" book.</paragraph><paragraph parID="430">She read it. With no bribes from me. And understood it. And enjoyed the funny parts. Not only that, but on our next library trip she also wanted to find the series so that she could continue reading these chapter books. Books that the experts said she could never read. What joy that brings to a mommy's heart!</paragraph><paragraph parID="431">As homeschooling has become more mainstream, many people have become aware of its positive results with regard to academics. Many of us are proud to tout the academic record of homeschoolers. And that's okay. But we must never become so confident in our academic success that we're willing to request favors from the government (be it tax credits or sports in the public schools or something else) based on homeschoolers' ability to measure up academically. "Oh, we don't have to worry if the state checks up on homeschoolers because, after all, we're doing so well anyway!" Please remember that there are homeschoolers who cannot compete in the academic contests. Those children are very likely doing better academically in homeschool than they would in conventional school, but they still wouldn't measure up if the government increased its regulation of homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="432">All of us, because we are their parents, have the right and the authority to homeschool our children. It is not a privilege parceled out by the state only to those who measure up. It is critical for homeschoolers to recognize this and never to ask for "help" from the government which will come with strings attached. Those strings may be something you're willing to live with, but those just might be strings which strangle another family out of the homeschooling lifestyle, a family which may be desperate for an alternative to conventional schools. Rather than being limited to their homes, homeschoolers are active in their communities and learn through work experience, volunteer service, field trips, travel, and other activities outside their homes. To maintain our homeschooling freedoms, we need to make it clear that homeschools are private schools, not public schools, and therefore should not be subject to the same regulations as public schools, including compliance with state standards, state-mandated testing, etc. Virtual charter schools are public schools and should not be called "home schools" and, even more serious, should certainly not be called "homeschools."</paragraph><paragraph parID="433">The concept of homeschooling as separate from and independent of public schools is a radical idea primarily because the growing consensus by the educational establishment, big business, and the media has been that attendance at conventional public or private schools was essential to a child's education. September 1993 ADVANCED HOMESCHOOLING CURRICULUM A. Advocate Earl Stevens drew comparisons between public education and homeschooling, and offered these opinions and advice: As a homeschooling parent you are uniquely free to drop things that don't work and to try alternatives, even radical alternatives. "Currently there are a lot of people going about making solemn pronouncements about their methods and systems and formulas for homeschooling success. Homeschooling is an opportunity for independent thinking and self confidence, not imitation and conformity." One of the reasons that they constantly need to see results in the form of test scores is that they have no other way to demonstrate to parents and to taxpayers that something is happening.'</paragraph><paragraph parID="434">Our job is not the same as that of public school teachers, and there is no need for us to imitate them." "When a child has difficulty coping with something in a school, the usual response is to give him or her lots more of it. Some families avoid conventional schooling practices altogether and choose instead to rely entirely upon daily life and the natural curiosity and eagerness of children. These parents may decide to provide resources, tools, support and encouragement but no lessons and no timetable. Many families decide to combine elements of both approaches. You may feel very comfortable with reading or with history but not with mathematics or some other acadeniic subject. Your treatment of reading and history may be a decision to just not interfere with a child who is doing lots of reading and likes history, but you may find that you are both interested in a more systematic [curriculum] approach to math as the child gets older.</paragraph><paragraph parID="435">"If you sit in on an elementary school classroom or read through a curriculum, you will see that much of what is taught is nothing more than a structured, rigid and sometimes bizarre way of presenting what children will easily learn on their own if nobody makes a big fuss about it. "Grade level expectations are an arbitrary mess created for the purposes of mass education, and no thoughtful educator takes them seriously when applied to individual children in a home environment." If we are not impressed by certificates, credentials and self aggrandizement among public educators, then there is no reason why we should be impressed by them within the home education movement." Click Here To Recommend This Story To A Friend Clearly, a lot of parents make the decision to keep their children home and educate them within the family unit because they are frustrated by the quality of public schools. Some studies tend to indicate that homeschoolers are generally more successful than their schooled counterparts in terms of academic achievement. "I've talked to children who are in the public school system and they say the peer pressure is great, and they wish they could also be homeschooled.</paragraph><paragraph parID="436">Why should I allow myself to be humiliated and crucified by peer pressure in the school system when I can concentrate on my studies?" Young Vollmer notes proudly, "I can pick whom I want to socialize with. I'm not forced to socialize with people who do not have the same values as I do." One of the striking things about some of these newsletters that these homeschoolers put out is that they are replete with grammatical errors, poor spelling, and other indications that the so-called 'teachers' are in dire need of some teaching themselves." Critics of home-schooling say teaching is a very underrated profession and that the notion that any Tom, Dick or Mary can be a good teacher is beyond absurd. Unhappy with the quality of our schools, some parents are teaching their children at home. But what are the plusses and minuses?</paragraph><paragraph parID="437">It was over ten years ago that the National Commission on Excellence in Education published a report entitled "A Nation At Risk," warning that the country could soon be overwhelmed by a "rising tide of mediocrity" because of its public school system. Since then, despite the concerns expressed by politicians, parents, and community leaders, our nation's public schools have not improved much. In fact, according to a federally-funded report recently released, class work in English, math, science, history, geography, foreign languages, civics and fine arts has shrunk to only 50% of the typical American high school day. Incredibly, U.S. high schoolers only spend an average of about three hours every day on core academic subjects -- half as much as the time spent by German, French and Japanese students. The typical U.S. public school curriculum has been "dumbed down," at the same time schools have taken over the responsibility for teaching everything from health to consumer affairs. Concurrently, there has been a renewed interest in home-schooling -- that is, parents taking responsibility for educating their own children in the home, as opposed to sending them to public schools. It is estimated that over 300,000 families now practice the oldest, most traditional method of instruction, which is legal in all 50 states and in virtually all countries of the world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="438">Comments Rebecca Rupp, author of "Schooltools: Educational Resources for Parents and Teachers" (Home Education Press, Tonasket, Washington), the decision to home-school represents "a battery of decisions, reflecting your view of the place of families in society, your attitude toward the political and social status quo. It's a decision about what you find rewarding, about how you define success. It's a decision, face it, that ranks kids ahead of careers. It's a statement about the kind of life you want for yourselves and your children." Laws governing home schooling vary widely from state to state in their specificity and enforcement. For example, in Missouri, home-schoolers are merely required to maintain attendance records, children's portfolios and logs of hours spent in "school." In Minnesota, a teaching parent does not even need a high school diploma.</paragraph><paragraph parID="439">In Tennessee, teaching parents must have college degrees to teach their high-school-age children. Some states, however, like Pennsylvania, are beset with restrictions. Homeschoolers there must provide a notarized affidavit to the local school district, including an annual list of educational objectives; maintain a detailed log of home school activities; submit a portfolio of student work to the district school superintendent; and each pupil must be evaluated annually by qualified personnel and take standardized tests -- which include phonics drills, arithmetic worksheets and reading comprehension exercises. Although sometimes home-schoolers are presumed to adopt a sort of free-form approach to educating their children, most say they also think kids should have a general education, acquiring a basic body of knowledge in literature, mathematics, science, social science and the humanities. With this in mind, they do plan ahead, drawing up a 12-month curriculum each summer. Critics of home-schooling, however, say its practitioners are often arrogant, unimaginative, intellectually shallow and academically substandard. Yet recent independent studies suggest that home-schools operate under conditions that most beleaguered teachers only dream of: they're small, and as such, are flexible, able to respond quickly to each student.</paragraph><paragraph parID="440">Says Rebecca Rupp, "Every child, as all parents know, marches determinedly along to his or her own drummer. Homeschools -- where the student/teacher ratio is about as good as it gets -- are in a unique position to zero in on each student's learning style, to adapt to the needs and interests of the individual. In home-school, you can strike while the educational irons are hot, and you have the freedom to drop them when they're cold. According to Sydney Mathis of the National Homeschool Association in Cincinnati, Ohio, "there are just as many approaches to homeschooling as there are reasons that families choose that lifestyle, including: an education consistent with a learning style and philosophy of how learning occurs; the time and ability to focus on strengths and to strengthen skills at a time and place that is beneficial; living abroad or in less accessible areas; the health of a family member; academic rigor; curriculum choices and values; and the teacher/student ratio." David Gardner, former president of the University of California who chaired the panel that wrote "A Nation At Risk," observes that "What I see is a slow, steady erosion of public regard for the public schools and in some respects a psychological abandonment." Rebecca Rupp bemoans "the lessons taught by the structure of the school system itself -- the idea that learning is something that must be done to you by somebody else, the idea that conformity with the group is all-important, the idea that doing well means following orders. Any large institution necessarily prefers a cooperative, homogeneous community, making schools, by definition, poor breeding grounds for free thinkers, rebels, square pegs or squeaky wheels.</paragraph><paragraph parID="441">Home-schoolers, by and large, aim to raise people who think for themselves." In some ways, today's home-schools are a throwback to the one-room country schools of our parents' youth, when teachers had students from first through 12th grades all in one classroom. Paige Smith comments that "'Unschooling,' 'natural learning,' student-initiated learning' and many other terms have been coined by home-schoolers to describe learning situations where the subjects studied are chosen by the students in accordance with their interests. Still, advocates say, it is important to recognize and accept the fact that differences in achievement and skills will no doubt occur even among homeschoolers. "School itself is often a truncated and abnormal society," complains Ms. Rupp, "and the exchanges that take place there seldom teach kindness, compassion or tolerance. Edwin L. Bercier claims "Homeschooling is like an oasis in the midst of a world of total desert. One of the first things that they notice about their children, once they have been removed from school for awhile, is that their social skills begin to improve.</paragraph><paragraph parID="442">"What happens in those cases when children are being kept home from public schools and instructed by parents who themselves were underachievers academically?" Home-schoolers jealously guard their freedom, even resisting efforts by some members of Congress, however well-intentioned, to introduce the terms "home schools" and "religious schools" as a separate class of schools in federal statutes, fearing that the government would then gain dominion over them. "Religious schools and home schools will be in a weaker position politically if they have to stand alone than if they can stand in the company of each other and other private schools" Some families even buy insurance from the Homeschool Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) to protect themselves against possible legal conflicts over home-schooling with their local or state education authorities. The National Homeschool Association says simply, "Most colleges and universities have entrance exams, but many of them place much more weight on an individual student's ability and aptitude. Home-schooled children have encountered little difficulty in continuing their education, whether in local community colleges, the Ivy League universities, vocational institutes, or other avenues of high education." Home-schooling isn't cheap, and it requires a lot of adult time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="443">There are resources which simply must be bought -- like science kits, art supplies, map puzzles, historical games, audio and visual equipment and tapes. Yet many financially-strapped home-schoolers have made an art out of making do, by patronizing yard sales and used-book stores, creating their own materials, borrowing and sharing. Home-schooling, its devotees admit, expands to fill all available hours. True they would be able to get that in a public school, but there are some things they would not have been able to get in a public school and we couldn't afford private education, particularly at a Christian private school, which for us, and not saying for everyone, but for us, was also an important factor in our decision making if they should or should not go to public school. Do they have the temperament to home school or are we better off letting them go to public school. Sure we would talk about homeschooling, but often in a laughing tone of my husband working in some far off country or in the deep regions of Alaska (don't ask what we were thinking there other than we were reading too much Hemingway and adventure books I guess), and as a last resort, I would just stay where-ever home was and teach the kids, myself. I pray that you understand Gentle Reader and not start with the flaming comments, but I was just one of those moms, who, if I'm going to stay-at-home, I'm going to stay-at-home but that also meant being involved with the kids lives and not just shuttling them to one class to another each week, but getting them involved around the house and engaging in activities, play dates, and just being a mom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="444">Basically, our thinking and budget is, if it costs money that we had to budget in as a one income family, then I might as well be working out of the home as well to supplement it, but if I'm going to stay at home, part of being a good steward of our finances and supporting being a stay at home was making sacrifices that included doing what they use to do before hourly mother programs and classes, and we would be creative,at home. We were well prepared to consider public school and had attended a meeting at the local schools to find out more what they provided to kids on the public education level, because we really wanted to find out what public school had to offer to our kids. These are our kids and it matter to us what they were learning, how they were learning and where they were learning and we got to find out everything to expect before our kids started public school and was it a doozy. I was so glad we took the time to really look at both sides of the pictures, both the pro's and con's of both public schooling and homeschooling. We were given what we thought was a well-thought out, balanced presentation of the curriculum, the expectations and the desires but as we weighed the pros and cons of me staying home and home schooling versus public school, began to realize there were more benefits to home schooling than there were public schools. There was genuine concerns about the structure and the fact that we were concerned about how they were going to learn and to be taught and how little input we felt as parents we were able to give. PTA is great for some, but I wanted to do more than just bake a million cookies on Sunday night for a Monday morning class, I was not told about until I did the laundry and found the neon green paper with lights flashing, stuff in the back pocket of the jeans.I really wanted to feel I had more of a choice and input on how they were learning, what they were learning and being able to challenge them when they needed to be challenge.</paragraph><paragraph parID="445">This wasn't an overnight decision and we didn't make the decision lightly. We slept on it literally for several weeks. At night, my husband and I took to the internet to research both sides of the stories....I really took extra attention to blogs I visit ,written by women who home schooled, that I didn't really pay much attention before about home schooling because it wasn't something I thought was going to be in our future at the time, and really read from their perspective, taking time and care to make sure I heard both the good and particularly any bad of home schooling. I researched local homeschooling groups and state and national based; I talked to teachers who taught at public school to get their perspective; I talked to moms who home schooled not just the first time but who have seen their kids through homeschooling from Pre-K to high school. It helped that there was a couple at our church, an assistant pastor and his wife who tag-team, homeschooling their children so we were able to get a perspective of how they were able to do it and not just get a woman's viewpoint but a man's viewpoint about homeschooling. They had even tried public school for awhile until both their kids personally requested that they went back to homeschooling. We get our curriculum free through a neighboring public school district and our library is our best friend.</paragraph><paragraph parID="446">That and I tried to copy the public school model in my home. T: That the hay racks in the cow barn are movable and can go up as the cow's manure and hay build up the floor level. B: That it's much easier to produce and sell rabbit meat than poultry because it's still such a small, niche market. It's about those people who care about what they eat. It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life, and in change there is power. I'm also not going to discuss this absurd -- but still prevalent -- misconception about home schoolers and "socialization."</paragraph><paragraph parID="447">Schools can certainly play a part in that, but real socialization always -- for better or worse -- occurs in the heart of the family and community. At my younger girl's first soccer game, I met a mom who is officially beginning to home school this year; her older daughter is starting Kindergarten. No one would look to them for "socialization." They would have some role to play in all that, of course, along with the rest of the community. But we would all acknowledge the real travelers on this journey -- parents, along with extended families, faith groups, and communities. Have there been any other states that have come together - secular and religious - to fight for state-wide homeschooling rights? When we can work together, and show that our homeschooling rights run deeper than personal conviction, that they are about democracy, freedom, and independence, for everyone, then we will send a much stronger message than we ever could alone.</paragraph><paragraph parID="448">Public schoolers look at life and learning differently than we do, and that's why they come to this conclusion. To most everyone in our society, learning is scripted and preprogrammed by someone else. Learning is like a machine you enter, have things done to you, and when you come out the other end, you are "educated." Some of those prescripted things are fun, some aren't, and if you could possibly refuse to partake in some elements, you would come out "defective." We look at learning from the other side of the universe, it seems. We see it as a process of discovering who you are as a human being. The things you enjoy and find easy are the things you might be gifted at and are worth your time developing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="449">Then as you pursue your interests, you might come to a wall. Are you interested enough to keep working and break through that wall? This is not easy reading, by any means, yet he wants to understand, so he spends his free time reading, thinking, and talking about this book. If we subject children to a daily, yearly barrage of information and practice they hate, we are running the risk of killing their love of learning. We are teaching them that learning is a chore that has to be endured. It's the motivation and eyes on the prize that propel us to do what we really want to do--and succeed. And sometimes we need the perspective of time away from institutional school to see who we are and what we really want out of life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="450">Kids who have the privilege of finding that out early have the advantage and don't have wasted years trying to "find themselves." During the school year, I start to forget that homeschooling is that unusual. When we're at home, even though our neighbors don't homeschool, they know we do, and we had the mandatory philosophical discussions about our educational choices so long ago that it's now a non-issue. The why and the how... and I've figured out how to read people a little better so that when the questions start about curriculum, I can usually tell if I need to be a little vague about the concept of "relaxed eclectic". If the question comes up about socialization, I just point to my kids. Who tend to be in the middle of a group. I forget that we have become programmed into believing the tests and trusting this assembly line education that even teachers acknowledge doesn't work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="451">The parents who are most confused about unschooling or more relaxed homeschooling aren't educators. Most teachers get it, particularly if they've been in the school system long enough to watch the tests take hold of the curriculum. My husband is going into administration now after more fifteen years in education and sometimes his co-workers question why his own children are homeschooled, but the questions don't last long because then they really think about it and it's pretty obvious. It's weird to watch the middle school drama unfold and to watch the girls decide who they'll exclude this week and to watch my daughter recognize it happening and quickly include the girl in her own group of friends and so then watch the lines between groups blur a little. It's interesting to watch the structure created in the public school blend with the lack of structure in our homeschooling life, and to watch others absorb it while we watch our own children respond appropriately to the social mores and expectations that we've been told they wouldn't learn. Missy's homeschooling journey began when she realized that the walls surrounding her daughter's classroom were too narrow; there was no room for exploration, no space for stretching. Now, she and her three children stretch and explore the world together.</paragraph><paragraph parID="452">Testing is seen as a good thing by many, but can cause stress and pressure on children - as well as helping to instill a feeling of success or failure depending on the results. Usually this is raised as a disadvantage of homeschooling , but it can in fact work wonderfully well in allowing the children to choose friends they really like. The table reflects a difference in opinion about what makes a good education . For example, testing appears as both an advantage and disadvantage on the schools list. And although it is said that children get the opportunity to socialize at school, some children are still isolated, or bullied. You can only really compare on an individual basis . What can you offer your child by homeschooling them, and what would be their opportunities at your local public school?</paragraph><paragraph parID="453">NHERI executes, evaluates, and disseminates studies and information (e.g., statistics, facts, data) on homeschooling (i.e., home schooling, home-based education, home education, home-schooling, unschooling, deschooling, a form of alternative education), publishes reports and the peer-reviewed scholarly journal Home School Researcher, and serves in consulting, academic achievement tests, and expert witness (in courts and legislatures). Homeschooled students often make the news for their academic achievements, such as placing first in the national spelling bee. Studies have shown that homeschooled students academically outperform their peers in both public and private schools and are well socialized. Today, the movement has grown to become one of the fastest growing alternatives to public education. In addition, a GED carries with it the stigma of being a high school drop-out. Schools frequently ask for an additional evaluation from someone outside the home. said Emory University (GA), "Very creative!"</paragraph><paragraph parID="454">"We look at them in their own individual situations," was the welcoming attitude expressed by a director of admissions in New Jersey. Copyright 2006 Home School Legal Defense Association. Home Schoolers Score Significantly Above National Average , National Center for Home Education Press Release, December 7, 1994. The Wall Street Journal , May 10, 1994 Homeschoolers are academically, emotionally, and socially prepared to succeed at college. Nevertheless, 96% of the colleges polled had at least one and sometimes over 200 home-educated students enrolled at their college. Several colleges had homeschoolers excelling in their honors programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="455">Although homeschoolers are being admitted, many still face problems due to a lack of clear criteria and minimal flexibility in current admission procedures. "[Transcripts are] irrelevant because a transcript is basically a comparison to other students in the school." &#147;The homeschoolers in this state seem to be up-to-date and well-organized. We even have homeschoolers in our honors programs. They prefer a portfolio with as much information as possible, including extra curricular activities that demonstrate leadership. &#147;Homeschoolers show strongly in that,&#148; said the admissions officer for Penn State. Lewis and Clark College (OR) has a method of application called the &#147;Portfolio Path&#148; where a student can bypass standardized tests and instead be &#147;reviewed on a myriad of things that would point to, and measure academic performance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="456">&#147;Homeschoolers have to work harder thereby increasing student productivity,&#148; Jeff Lantis said of the 75-90 homeschoolers at Hillsdale College (MI). &#147;Homeschoolers are consistently among our top students, in fact homeschoolers have won our distinct Honors Program the last three years in a row. We tend to look very favorably upon homeschoolers applying to our college. We believe students educated at home possess the passion for knowledge, the independence, and the self-reliance that enable them to excel in our intellectually challenging programs of study. They are self-directed, they take risks, and they don't back off." In 2002, an employee of Ball State University reported that "eighty percent of first time freshman who were homeschooled were admitted to one of our upper levels of admission, with 67% being admitted to Honors College-our highest level of admission. For example, the 2219 students reporting their homeschool status on the SAT in 1999 scored an average of 1083 (verbal 548, math 535), 67 points above the national average of 1016.</paragraph><paragraph parID="457">In 2004 the 7858 homeschool students taking the ACT scored an average of 22.6, compared to the national average of 20.9. The University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) have also seen higher ACT and SAT averages from homeschoolers in comparison to the total school population. While documentation and evaluation of homeschooled applicants is problematic, it is not insurmountable. Only 44% of the responding colleges had verbal or written policies for homeschool applicants. The Wall Street Journal confirms that many colleges are adjusting their admissions policies to homeschoolers: Many colleges now routinely accept homeschooled students, who typically present &#147;portfolios&#148; of their work instead of transcripts. A Harvard University (MA) admissions officer said most of their home-educated students "have done very well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="458">They usually are very motivated in what they do." Results of the SAT and SAT II, an essay, an interview, and a letter of recommendation are the main requirements for home-educated applicants. In addition to Harvard, prominent schools like Yale (CT), Princeton (NJ), Texas A&amp;amp;M, Brown University (RI), the Carnegie Mellon Institute (PA), the Universities of Arizona, Maryland, Virginia, Hawaii and many others all have flexible transcript criteria, accept parental evaluations, and do not require any accreditation or a General Equivalency Diploma (GED). At Kansas State University and others like Lipscomb University and Middlebury College (VT), transcripts are optional. In 1996, Birmingham-Southern College (AL) had only one homeschool applicant, but the admissions officer said the college &#147;would be glad to have many more just like him! &#147;Homeschooling is becoming more and more prevalent,&#148; said Mark Wheeler of Boise State University (ID). Pennsylvania State University had 20 homeschool applicants in 1995, double the previous year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="459">&#148; A UK admissions officer also said, &#147;Our homeschoolers (about 50) tend to be very bright, and have scored very high on standardized tests. The Dartmouth College (NH) admissions officer explained, &#147;The applications I&#146;ve come across are outstanding. University of Alaska/Fairbanks has had over 300 home-educated students in the last few years, several of which were in their honors program. The program director, Mary Dicicco commented, &#147;They have been wonderful students on the whole! USA TODAY reported on October 28, 1996, that the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill&#146;s dean of admissions, James Walters, has enrolled about 20 home-educated students, all of which &#147;are performing above average academically. A letter sent in 1991 to homeschool leaders in Massachusetts from Thomas M. Rajala, Director of Admissions at Boston University is another example of the recognition institutions of higher learning are showing homeschoolers&#146; academic achievements: Boston University welcomes applications from homeschooled students.</paragraph><paragraph parID="460">They tend to be very involved socially on campus, especially in groups relating to their academic major and in student religious groups." Because of this, Caffrey stated that ISU is considering actively recruiting homeschool students at college fairs. According to the 1998 ACT High School Profile Report, 2610 graduating homeschoolers took the ACT and scored an average of 22.8 out of a possible 36 points. This offers a strong validation that home education is a viable and effective educational alternative.

Anecdotes About Horrible, Sexist "Quiverfull" Families Probably Proof That Homeschooling Needs More Government Oversight | Bastiat Institute Take Vyckie Garrison, an ex-Quiverfull mother of seven who, in 2008, enrolled her six school-age children in public school after 18 years of teaching them at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="462">And she says the lack of regulation in Nebraska, where the family lived, "allowed us to get away with some really shoddy homeschooling for a lot of years." "Because I was so overwhelmed with my life... It was a real struggle to do the basics, so it didn't take long for my kids to fall far behind. One of my daughters could not read at 11 years old." Garrison goes on to to critique her previous views about public schools: "We became so isolated because the Quiverfull lifestyle was so overwhelming we didn't have time or energy for socialization. So the only people we knew were exactly like us. We were told that the whole point of public school was to dumb down the children and turn them into compliant workers - to brainwash them and indoctrinate them into this godless way of thinking."</paragraph><paragraph parID="463">Garrison believes that homeschooling has become so popular with fundamentalist Christians because, "there is an atmosphere of real terror among some evangelicals. They are horrified by the fact that Obama is president, and they see the New Atheist movement as a vocal, in-your-face threat.... The government cannot tell you -- and there is no systematic state-by-state record of the percentage of truancy convictions (possibly the best measure of educational neglect at present) that involve homeschooling families versus those involving enrolled students and/or their parents. "Part of the reason we homeschool is because I'm choosing what worldview or what subjects I want to introduce my child to," she says. But she understand the limits of her own skill, which is why she placed her special-needs son in public school. "While I can teach my children reading, writing and arithmetic, I am not trained in special education," she says. "I want my child to have the best education he can get, which at this time is public school."</paragraph><paragraph parID="464">Though she considers herself conservative, Goeller does not demonize public schools as some families do. And contrary to stereotypes about Christian homeschoolers, Goeller is adamant that she will not sacrifice academic rigor, or shield her children from views different from her own. In fact, she says she would welcome more opportunities for them to interact with public school students, for example, in sports and even in certain classes now and then. A homeschooling graduate of the mid-1990s, and an ex-Quiverfull daughter I have known for many years, Diegel Martin was pulled out of public school at 14. Because she was old enough to remember several years of public schooling, she says she never really believed her parents' dire warnings about it. Her younger brothers were another story. "When the school bus would come by, my youngest brother would go, 'There goes the prison bus.'</paragraph><paragraph parID="465">Our parents had them believing that public schools were these horrible places, just dens of iniquity." The narrative about public schools, she says, went something like this: "How would you like to get stuck in a building with no light - and secular, godless, atheist teachers for seven hours of the day without even being able to see your parents or go out to play?" As a result, she says, "My brothers were terrified of the public schools." But Rawls (and Martin here, if she is being quoted honestly) completely destroy their own premise - their maybe not totally bullshit premise that there are truly neglected children out there who are going totally unnoticed by authorities- by incessantly implying that to distrust government-run schools and to describe them as places of restriction is abusive or at least suspicious brainwashing. And does it need to be said, since the spelling bee champ nerdy homeschooler is a cliche, that yes, their test scores tend to be in the 70th and above percentile? It's the lingering questions about socialization and abuse that bother people like Rawls and Slate 's Goldstein. 6 It is interesting to speculate how the home school movement would have been different if the right to home school had been successfully built upon an abortion-rights foundation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="466">It seems safe to assume that the "religious right" would view home schoolers with suspicion, if not overt hostility. 9 Michigan Compiled Laws &#167; 380.1561(3)(f) exempts a child from attendance at a public school if the child is being educated at the child's home by his or her parent or legal guardian in an organized educational program in the subject areas of reading, spelling, mathematics, science, history, civics, literature, writing, and English grammar. Because we believe there is strength in a diverse network of homeschoolers, we support the freedom of all individual families to choose home education and to direct such education. As alienated Evangelicals began to critique the public schools, however, they concluded that the problems went deeper than that. Evangelicals decided that schools were actively promoting an alternative religion that they identified as "secular humanism." The National Home Education Network exists to encourage and facilitate the vital grassroots work of state and local homeschooling groups and individuals by providing information, fostering networking and promoting public relations on a national level. 13 This section is taken, in large part, from Chris Klicka's "Home-School Families: Involved or Isolated?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="467">"This court agrees with the above decisions that the number of students does not determine a school and further, that a certain number of students need not be present to attain an equivalent education." The court reiterated Roberts , emphasizing that the object of the statute is that "all children shall be educated, not that they shall be educated in a particular way." For some time, we unschoolers are not likely to find many lawyers, anywhere in the country, who know as much about the law on unschooling as we know or can easily find out. We cannot rely on them to work out good strategies and write good briefs for us-at least, not at a price that most of us can afford. (Holt, 1976, p. 297) Many of the early home schoolers were well to the left of the political spectrum, and some assumed the American Civil Liberties Union would rise to defend them. The ACLU's absence was a critical but often overlooked factor in shaping the subsequent development of home school politics.</paragraph><paragraph parID="468">Public school officials insisted that "equivalent instruction" would have to include more than just equivalent academics. The school establishment insisted upon equivalent social interaction, too. When a home school family was prosecuted for lack of socialization, however, the court sided with the home schoolers. ) Massa , supra .) In states where the compulsory attendance law required attendance at a "private school," home schoolers argued that their home was a private school. In some states, the courts promptly rejected this claim. In others, the judges gave home schoolers the benefit of the doubt.</paragraph><paragraph parID="469">Twenty years ago, home education was treated as a crime in almost every state. Today, it is legal all across America, despite strong and continued opposition from many within the educational establishment. In the early days of the modern home schooling movement (c. 1965), there were no support groups or newsletters for parents who taught their children at home. Many parents who taught their children at home never knew that there were any other people doing the same thing. Every family had to invent home education from scratch. The only safe way to start home schooling was to start before the child reached school age, or to move to a new school district where no one knew the child existed. When parents got caught, they had no legal excuses, no useful precedents, and usually, no money to hire the kind of lawyer who would fight for an unwritten freedom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="470">Parents were arrested, jailed, or fined until they put their children back in school. The school officials who prosecuted home schoolers strongly believed that they were protecting innocent children from serious harm. Certified teachers and highly trained school administrators had no reason to believe that parents could cover the basic academic subjects, much less provide the social interactions that were offered in the public schools. To many public school teachers, home education seemed to be child neglect, at best. The public school officials who were charged with enforcing the truancy laws had every reason to be thorough. Their professional training was founded on the assumption that teaching was not a job for laymen or amateurs. The general public believed that children need a rich set of interactions with other children if they are ever to succeed in later life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="471">Graduates of the public school system had been consistently taught that public schools bring together rich and poor and male and female to teach children to be true Americans. After the Supreme Court ended legal segregation in Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the schools finally brought together black and white, and then, with the school prayer cases, even Jews, Catholics and nonbelievers gained equal standing within the schools. Home schoolers started out as scattered individuals with little or no resources who faced powerful enemies as they violated the law in a climate of social disapproval. In the early sixties, Paul Goodman, in Compulsory Miseducation and Growing Up Absurd , argued that compelling children to attend school is not the best use of their youth, and that education is more a community function than an institutional one. A. Limited Resources Home schooling never should have succeeded in the modern era. It may have been adequate for the agricultural setting of our colonial ancestors, but who would have thought that untrained parents could throw together a homemade curriculum that would actually prepare a child for life in the twenty-first century?</paragraph><paragraph parID="472">They did not even have a name for what they were doing. The school officials had a name for what they were doing, however - criminal truancy. Each time parents pulled a child out of public school, the unexcused absences began to accumulate. Some open-minded school officials were willing to look the other way, but others insisted on enforcing the law. The only sure way to avoid legal trouble was to hide. This kept the authorities from finding out about home schooling, but it kept everyone else from finding out about it, too. School officials had powerful and selfless reasons to oppose home education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="473">They were not merely motivated by the fact that school budgets were based upon a certain number of dollars for every child in attendance. (In the early days of home education, few school officials ever imagined that home education could ever have a real financial impact on the schools.) But each home schooler did undoubtedly cost the district some small amount in lost revenues. All these factors added up to a solid wall of opposition to home schooling within the public school establishment. Home schoolers also faced a wall of opposition from their neighbors. Whenever a home schooler tried to explain what he was doing to some other person, he could always count on two questions: Is that legal ? And what about socialization ?</paragraph><paragraph parID="474">There was a deeper sense that home education was somehow un-American. Home schoolers seemed to turn their back on the preeminently democratic institution of America. Further, some writers, such as A.S. Neill and Holt, suggested that the student should have complete freedom to choose how, when , and from whom they wanted to learn. Further, schools view education as a commodity they sell, rather than as a life-long process they can aid, and this, according to Illich, creates a substance that is not equally distributed, is used to judge people unfairly, and-based on their lack of school credentials-prevents people from assuming roles they are otherwise qualified for. The '70s saw the rise of "delayed schooling" as an alternative to "unschooling." His book, Better Late Than Early suggested that parents should keep children out of formal education for the first few grades. His research indicated that a healthy child could start formal schooling at fourth grade without any harm.</paragraph><paragraph parID="475">This holistic emphasis found ready acceptance within the existing home school community, and soon broadened its appeal to less politically-oriented families. Modern home schooling was launched by left-wing intellectuals and legalized by the religious right, but home schooling is not just for the ends of the political spectrum anymore. Politicians know these are important "swing voters" who are not locked into either political party. Bill Clinton strategically deployed a number of bite-sized policy initiatives (school uniforms, daytime curfews, etc.) that were designed to win the votes of these mothers. But home schooling is proving to be an even bigger success with these highly motivated mainstream mothers. Now that it is acceptable and produces good results, they are willing to try it out. These parents have undoubtedly been influenced by the good press that homeschooling is receiving.</paragraph><paragraph parID="476">Journalists have pumped out a steady stream of articles exploring this intriguing new educational phenomenon, noting the advantages of one-on-one instruction, mastery learning, and parental involvement. By the time home schoolers won first, second, and third place in the 2000 Spelling Bee, and the winner also took second place in the National Geographic Bee, the rush was on. He believed home schooling could lead to a renewal of traditional Christian family living. "The Christian Schools Movement" 3 of the 1970s was running out of churches that were willing and able to start schools, but individual families were still looking for alternatives to the secular public schools. It energized a new wave of Christian home schoolers who left the schools for religious rather than pedagogical reasons. The new wave of evangelical home schoolers created friction with many local school districts. The first wave of unschoolers were convinced that they had a better educational alternative, and many of them were usually willing to work to persuade skeptical school officials that they had a better mousetrap.</paragraph><paragraph parID="477">Open-minded superintendents were usually willing to let them try. The evangelicals had a whole different reason for leaving the public schools. Some rejected public education as "godless" and thought of school officials as secular humanists who were bent on godless mind-control. Parents like these asserted that the Bible required them, not the school system, to raise their own children. They were often not willing to seek "permission" from the schools. Christian parents who fled the public schools to escape secular humanism were understandably shocked by the lifestyles of some of their fellow home schoolers. Soon no informed person could dismiss home schooling as a right-wing reaction to secular humanism.</paragraph><paragraph parID="478">The Florida Department of Education used to ask parents why they chose to teach their children at home. Religious and/or moral concerns were the primary reason for home schooling in Florida until 1993, but "dissatisfaction with public schools" moved into the lead in the 1993-94 school year. For the first time, large numbers of families began to choose home education for purely academic reasons. Home education had long been a way to protest the military-industrial establishment, or to seek a more holistic lifestyle, or to flee the secularized schools. These earlier families tended to view home schooling as a moral necessity, rather than a personal choice. With the new legality and social acceptability of home education however, many newer home schoolers viewed it as just one more choice on the academic menu. There were ample positive academic reasons to consider home schooling, but, in the late 1990s, there were more ominous reasons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="479">A wave of shootings at public school culminated at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. Many observers thought Columbine would lead to a massive exodus to home schooling. There was some justification for this, at first. Educators say more parents are looking into home-schooling in the aftermath of the Columbine High School shootings. Suzy Parker, program assistant for the Colorado Department of Education, said she has been receiving five calls a day, about twice as many as normal. "One woman who lives right near Columbine called me the day of the shooting and told me, 'We're not doing this anymore,'" Parker said last week. The department reported 68 inquiries from parents on home-schooling in the month since Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide.</paragraph><paragraph parID="480">Any expectations that Columbine would be the end of public education died away quickly. A number of people considered home schooling, but most of them abandoned the idea when they realized how much work was really involved. According to the Rocky Mountain News , the overall impact on the Denver-area public schools was minimal. The deadly shooting rampage at Columbine High School has not sparked an exodus from public schools in favor of home-schooling, Denver-area school officials said. After an initial flurry of interest in home-schooling in the month after the April 20 tragedy, inquiries have returned almost to normal. "I don't see a big influx, or any big change from years past," said Sandy Campbell of student information services at Jefferson County Schools. She said she sent many packets in May to parents interested in home-schooling, but got few back.</paragraph><paragraph parID="481">"I got a lot more phone calls, but they didn't follow through," she said. ("No rush to home schools in wake of Columbine," Rocky Mountain News , Aug. 2, 1999.) Columbine did not end public education as we know it, but it did have a profound impact on the home school movement. One reason for this is the relative size of the two educational communities. If 50,000 public school students started home schooling because of Columbine, that would be less than one-tenth of one percent of the public school population. A nationwide loss of 50,000 students would hardly even register as a noticeable blip for the public schools, but it would be a huge increase for the relatively small home school movement. There have been more school shootings since Columbine, and one of the more recent tragedies has a special significance for home schooling parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="482">One of the two victims at Santee, California, was taught at home for a number of years. One of the teens slain in the Santee, Calif., rampage had been home-schooled for years because his parents feared public school was unsafe, but they relented when he begged to attend high school with his friends, it was reported today. Bryan Zuckor, 14, was a freshman at Santana HS despite his parents' misgivings, the Los Angeles Times reports. The boy was schooled at home for five years, but when he insisted he wanted to go to classes with friends, his parents reluctantly gave in, the newspaper said. Home schooling parents who have pulled their children out of the public schools are already very cautious about putting them back. Bryan Zuckor's death will make them doubly cautious. When a home schooler won the Scripps-Howard National Spelling Bee in 1997, parents of children in traditional schools began to wonder if their children were really getting the best education possible.</paragraph><paragraph parID="483">Suburban schools have a lot going for them, and home schooling is very hard work. It is possible that these new home schoolers will be teaching their children at home for years to come, but it is just as likely that they will return their children to a more traditional setting. I have chosen not to return him to the same school he left, because I still feel his education is compromised in that setting. I feel that home schooling is still a valuable way to educate children, but it also takes a commitment that we, unfortunately, were not able to make. Some were willing to give Rep. Miller the benefit of the doubt, others felt that the Armey Amendment had the potential to federalize home education instead of keeping the federal government out of it. Over the weekend, dozens of congressmen visiting their districts for the President's Day recess were confronted at town hall meetings, in their home offices, and elsewhere by concerned parents. Congressman were shocked by the populist response to what many of them believed to be an insignificant provision in a non-controversial bill.</paragraph><paragraph parID="484">Even the Associated Press ran a favorable nationally-syndicated story about the home school telephone blitz of Congress. Little did Congress know that the battle had just begun. On Monday, February 21 (President's Day ), Dr. James Dobson's Focus on the Family radio show featured Michael Farris and former Congressman Bob McEwen discussing the implications of H.R. 6. HSLDA's membership began receiving their urgent alert letters in the mail. Several Christian school organizations actively jumped on the H.R. 6 bandwagon, sending out their own mailings and fax alerts. Rush Limbaugh discussed H.R 6 on his radio show. Capitol Hill switchboards again closed down as record-breaking numbers of telephone calls poured into Congress.</paragraph><paragraph parID="485">On Tuesday, February 22, the second wave of telephone calls hit Congress in full force. For the rest of the day, no one on Capitol Hill would get anything done. Several congressmen could not even reach their own staff by telephone. Congressman Armey and Mike Farris continued to fight misinformation about the amendment on the Hill. HSLDA's own office received a record 10,000 incoming telephone calls. Braving an ice storm early the next morning, Mike Farris and home schoolers from as far away as Missouri made it into D.C. to lobby Congress. Local home school volunteers delivered another letter from Mike Farris to each congressional office.</paragraph><paragraph parID="486">Attached to this letter was a list of thousands of state and local home school organizations from around the country who officially supported the effort to advance the "Home School/Private School Freedom Amendment." Later that day, Farris was interviewed on H.R. 6 by more national media including CNN, Pat Buchanan, and Beverly LaHaye. And, amazingly, the Democrat-controlled House Rules Committee, willing to do almost anything to stop the mounting tide of phone calls, agreed to "open rule" on the floor. On Thursday, February 24, Armey's staff discovered that the Rules Committee inadvertently reprinted an outdated version of the "Home School/Private School Amendment." HSLDA asked Massachusetts home school leaders Bev Somogie and Marcie Arnett to alert home schoolers in the district of Rules Committee Chairman Joseph Moakley (D). Within the hour, Rep. Moakley's office was flooded with calls and he agreed to allow Armey to revise the amendment on the floor. Senators Ford and Kildee sponsored an ineffective competing amendment and circulated letters undermining the "Home School/Private School Amendment."</paragraph><paragraph parID="487">Armey responded with his own letter, refuting Ford and Kildee's charges. Finally, on Thursday afternoon, debate began on the two amendments. The Ford/Kildee amendment came to a vote and passed 424-1. Representative Miller was the only member to vote for it. Then Armey submitted his revised amendment. Home schoolers around the country watched C-Span with bated breath as congressmen from both parties lined up four and five deep to publicly state their support for the cause of home educators. After an hour-and-a-half of debate, the House voted on the Armey amendment, and home schoolers won a stunning 374-53 victory!</paragraph><paragraph parID="488">HSLDA sent out fax number five announcing the victory to the home school community. One week later, DC-area home school families delivered a special 10-pound bag of apples and a note of thanks to each congressional office. Home schoolers all over the country expressed their appreciation by sending flowers to their congressman. HSLDA's all-out assault on H.R. 6 had an undeniable political impact, but it did not make every home schooler happy. Such home schoolers eventually founded the National Home Education Network 12 to counter the growing impression that HSLDA was the only group speaking for home schoolers. Home schoolers recognize how fragile their liberty is, and are committed to defending that liberty at all costs. Chris Klicka of HSLDA provides the following first-hand account of one of the more recent political battles for liberty:</paragraph><paragraph parID="489">During the 105th Congress, I obtained a transcript of a meeting the U.S. Department of Education convened with educators from around the country to discuss the creation and implementation of a national test for all students. A university professor from Kansas, John Poggio, made a startling but obvious statement. He warned, "What gets tested, must be taught." A member of the Delaware Board of Education echoed a similar sentiment. She explained that Delaware would have to adjust its curriculum to fit the national test. If Clinton was able to create and implement a national test, it would, by default, create a national curriculum. The federal education bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., would control the education of our nation's youth in a more profound degree than ever before.</paragraph><paragraph parID="490">After meeting with the president of HSLDA, Mike Farris, who agreed battling this national test would be a major priority for us, I contacted Congressman Goodling's counsel [Bill Goodling was the Chairman of the House Education Committee] and told him that Mike Farris agreed we would "pull out all stops" if Goodling introduced a bill to cut off funding to Clinton's national test. The counsel said he would talk to Goodling. A week later, he explained Goodling was willing to introduce a resolution expressing the sense of the House opposing national testing. I told him there was no way we could get home schoolers to flood the Congress with calls over a resolution which had no power to stop testing. I asked him to go back to Goodling and explain we could not help him unless he introduced a bill to permanently ban testing. I emphasized, then and only then, could we deliver calls. Over the next year and a half, the home schoolers had the opportunity to prove themselves again and again as HSLDA sent out nearly 35 nationwide fax alerts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="491">And the home schoolers responded! Repeatedly the home schoolers flooded the House with calls and we organized our Congressional Action program volunteers to visit every office with packets exposing the dangers of the Clinton national test. In September of 1997, we won the first round in the House: 296 to 125 to stop funding of all national testing. The home schoolers had made the ban on testing viable. A key congressional staff admitted, "Without HSLDA and the home schoolers this could not have happened!" In October 1997, the Senate sold us out by compromising the bill and allowing a national test. This was unacceptable.</paragraph><paragraph parID="492">We told the leadership we would unleash another nationwide alert. In high stakes negotiating in conference committee, we achieved a temporary victory. We won a one-year ban on national testing. This meant the fight would continue in 1998. We hoped the grassroots would not become worn out. At the beginning of the next year, our champion, Congressman Goodling, introduced H.R. 2846, a permanent ban on national testing. Riding on a wave of calls from the home schoolers, the testing ban passed in a vote of 242 to 174.</paragraph><paragraph parID="493">The fight, however, was just beginning. We still had to get the bill through the Senate. Our champion in the Senate was John Ashcroft from Missouri. The only problem is that we did not have a "vehicle" to which to attach our testing amendment. Meanwhile, I attended a meeting with Senator Coverdell's chief of staff where he was recruiting support for the Senator's "A+ Education Savings Accounts" bill. I told him we could not deliver calls unless something was attached which would really motivate home schoolers to call. . . something like our prohibition on a national test amendment. A few days later, I received a call from Coverdell's office that they would allow the testing amendment to be attached.</paragraph><paragraph parID="494">The rules, however, required that a separate vote be taken on our amendment. We scheduled a lobby day and set appointments with a majority of senators while simultaneously sending out a nationwide alert to home schoolers to call their two U.S. Senators. I soon received a call from Senator Lott's office, who was the majority leader, telling me there was "not a chance in -------" that our testing amendment would be successful. They had done a "whip count" earlier in the day and only found 30 senators who would support our testing ban. They urged us not to push for the amendment because we would lose big. Our lobby effort the day before, however, gave us evidence that we were very close to winning the vote. Lott's office told me it was our call.</paragraph><paragraph parID="495">I said we wanted to go forward with the vote. I thought we could win. Besides, it might be our only chance to get a vote that year. In the meantime, the home schoolers were delivering thousands of calls and God's people were praying. On April 22, 1998, the vote was scheduled. It was amazing to watch. Ashcroft's amendment permanently banning national testing passed in a vote of 52-47!</paragraph><paragraph parID="496">Far more votes than the 30 votes predicted by Lott's office. The Senate leadership was amazed. The home schoolers had pulled it off. Later in June, we were contacted by the leadership in both the House and Senate, asking us if we would agree to have our testing amendment removed so that the "A+ Education Savings Account" bill could go the president in a "clean" form. (The "A+" bill was subsequently vetoed by the president.) We made Speaker Gingrich and Majority Leader Lott promise, in writing, that our testing amendment would be attached to another bill later in the year. In October 1998, they kept their promise in spite of intense threats from President Clinton.</paragraph><paragraph parID="497">We finally won. A permanent ban on a national test was achieved! (Klicka, personal communication.) Home School Politics The preceding sections describe a surprisingly successful movement. In this section, we will grope for some explanation of the secrets of that success. How did this small group of ragtag radicals become the largest successful educational reform movement in America today?</paragraph><paragraph parID="498">How did they change the laws of all 50 states and enact federal legislation over President Clinton's objections? Three factors seem to make the difference. A. Right Makes Might According to the "social contract" theories that led to the American Revolution, governments exist to serve certain purposes, and when the government undermines those purposes instead of serving them, the people have the right (perhaps even the duty) to rebel. Most home schoolers believe that governments should protect the safety and integrity of the home and leave the task of childrearing to parents. When parents believe their government threatens their home instead of protecting it, they feel justified in resisting that threat. Laws fade into insignificance when a parent thinks the government threatens the good of his or her children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="499">This touches on profound issues of political philosophy that need not be resolved for the purposes of this essay. We need not determine whether parents actually have a right to break a law that threatens their home, although such questions have begun to reach the highest courts in our land. (See, e.g. , Troxel v. Granville , 530 U.S. 57 (2000).) It is enough for us to examine what happens when large numbers of parents believe they have a right to go against the law. Home schoolers believe they do have a right to do what is best for their own children in their own homes, whatever the law may say. This article will not attempt to catalog the many different pressures that affect parochial school systems as they try to serve an increasingly diverse population, but the net result is that traditional Catholics sometimes feel the parochial schools are becoming more and more like the secular public schools. This is particularly true in the sensitive area of sex education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="500">Home education provides Catholic families a way to guarantee a distinctively Catholic education. The growth of Catholic home schooling has brought this trend to the attention of the Vatican, which has responded favorably. First, the more observant Catholics have been quick to notice that evangelical home schoolers put Catholics to shame when it comes to matters of human sexuality. The Catholic teachings that most offend secular America (regarding abortion, contraception, divorce) are enthusiastically practiced by many Protestant home schoolers. Protestant home schoolers are some of the most committed pro-life activists, and can often be found side-by-side with Catholic pro-lifers at crisis pregnancy centers or anti-abortion rallies. They are supported at the highest level of the hierarchy, and are usually encouraged at the parish level, but there is significant resistance to home education at the middle levels of the church structure. Home schoolers are a dynamic new force within American Catholicism, and it is too early to tell whether they will become "mainstream" or "marginal" within that church.</paragraph><paragraph parID="501">It is riskier for African-Americans to start home schooling than it is for other families. The final bell rang, and most of the students hoisted their textbook-filled backpacks and went home. But several stayed and clustered around me, their eyes intense. Among them stood a young man whose voice wavered between resignation and longing. He told me his name was Michael. "I totally see what you're saying about school, how it's a waste of time," he said, "And I know there's a lot more I could learn and do on my own. Yet black families are choosing home education in increasing numbers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="502">People, in general, homeschool so that children can learn more naturally and develop their unique talents. They homeschool to lessen the possibility of children being shot with a gun at school. They homeschool to maintain close family relationships. They homeschool to avoid the brutal school socialization process, which often turns thoughtful, unique children into rude conformists. They homeschool to honor their children's individual learning styles, which are not always compatible with sitting in a desk and shutting up. They homeschool to provide more challenging and thorough academic educations. They homeschool because they are tired of the racist, sexist propaganda that masquerades as truth in history textbooks.</paragraph><paragraph parID="503">They homeschool to break down artificial barriers between life and learning. They homeschool for other reasons too, concerning health, religion, geography, and self-esteem. Some homeschool because they see that racial integration in the schools has not always worked for their benefit. (Among other things, they feel that it has disrupted community life and thrust children into hate-filled classrooms where few people encourage or hope for their success.) Some homeschool because they see that schools perpetuate institutionalized racism. Some homeschool because they are tired of curricula emphasizing Europe and excluding Africa. Some homeschool because their children are overwhelmingly treated as problems in schools, and quickly labeled Attention Deficit Disordered or Learning Disabled.</paragraph><paragraph parID="504">Some homeschool because black kids drop out of school at much higher rates than white kids. Some homeschool because they want to continue the Civil Rights struggle for equal educational rights, and they feel that they can best do so by reclaiming their right to help their own children develop fully-rather than by working to get them equal access into conventional schooling. Despite this, home education is catching on within the black community, and each new African-American home schooler opens the door for many more. Now I know that it is true, and that many black people homeschool to save themselves from a system which limits and destroys them, to reclaim their own lives, families, and culture, to create for themselves something very different from conventional schooling. No one knows how many "underground home schoolers" there were in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but in many states, the only way to home school was to hide. There were a few states where home education was legal. The Oklahoma Constitution requires the legislature to provide for compulsory attendance at some public or other school, "unless other means of education are provided of all children in the State who are sound in mind and body, between the ages of eight and sixteen, for at least three months each year."</paragraph><paragraph parID="505">The "other means of education" language was added for the specific purpose of protecting the right of parents to choose home schooling. As a result of this discussion on home schooling, the "other means of education" language was added to Article 13, Section 4. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts permitted home education (as opposed to child labor) in Commonwealth v. Roberts , 34 NE 402 (Mass. 1893). The court emphasized that the object of the statute is that "all children shall be educated, not that they shall be educated in a particular way." An Indiana court permitted home schools as far back as 1904 in State v. Peterman , 32 Ind. The court defined a school as "a place where instruction is imparted to the young..... We do not think that the number of persons, whether one or many, make a place where instruction is imparted any less or any more a school." Quoting the Roberts decision in Massachusetts, the Indiana court said: "[T]he object and purpose of a compulsory educational law are that all the children shall be educated, not that they shall be educated in any particular way."</paragraph><paragraph parID="506">The Illinois Supreme Court recognized a right to teach a child at home in 1950 when it decided People v. Levisen , 404 Ill. 574, 90 N.E.2d 213 (1950). The Illinois Supreme Court emphasized the right of parents to control their children's education: "Compulsory education laws are enacted to enforce the natural obligations of parents to provide an education for their young, an obligation which corresponds to the parents' right of control over the child. Virginia was a haven for home schoolers after it enacted an exemption from compulsory attendance for conscientious objectors in 1954. There were Amish and Mennonite communities that refused to send their children to the public high schools, so Virginia took the conscientious objector language from the federal draft code and adapted it to the school setting. Virginia Code section 22.1-257(B) requires school boards to exempt from compulsory attendance "any child who, together with his parents, by reason of religious training or belief, is conscientiously opposed to attendance at school." John Holt was as much of a pioneer in home school law as he was in the field of education. In his book Teach Your Own , first published in 1981, Holt told families how to present a legal defense of home education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="507">In Texas, for example, the Texas Education Agency instructed school officials that home education was not legal and that home schoolers should be prosecuted if they would not put their children into traditional schools. Home schoolers argued that Texas was discriminating against parents by permitting any private school to operate except a private school operated by parents. The trial court agreed that this was enough of a possibility that criminal charges against home schoolers should be enjoined until a final determination of that question could be made. Over the next few years, HSLDA lawyers filed a series of broad constitutional challenges for HLSDA members in other states where home schoolers were under attack. Pennsylvania and New York each had an "approval" law that meant that home schoolers could not operate without individualized approval by their local school superintendent. In general, legislators were willing to allow parents to teach their own children as long as they provided an annual notice of their intent to teach a child at home and submitted evidence of academic achievement at the end of the school year. The Christian fundamentalists who want the freedom to indoctrinate their children with religious education do not understand that the law that prevents them from legally teaching their kids prevents someone else from abusing theirs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="508">Their purpose is twofold: to protect the state by ensuring a properly educated citizenry; to protect the children by ensuring that their labor is spent attaining an education. Abrogating the state's compulsory-attendance laws, or weakening them by allowing parents to teach children at home, is no less than a giant genuflection backward. That left Michigan as the very last state to prohibit home education by anyone but a certified teacher. The National Education Association, in particular, has voted to abolish home education every year since 1988: The National Education Association believes that home schooling programs cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience. The Association also believes that home-schooled students should not participate in any extracurricular activities in the public schools. The Association further believes that local public school systems should have the authority to determine grade placement and/or credits earned toward graduation for students entering or re-entering the public school setting from a home school setting.</paragraph><paragraph parID="509">Given the National Education Association's stated position and that union's influence within the Democratic Party, many home schoolers had reason to fear the election of Bill Clinton as President in 1992. Ordinarily such bills deal with public education and would have little, if any, impact on home educators. Many local school authorities believe that home and private schools are under their jurisdiction, so home schoolers were concerned. Concerned by the implications of the Miller amendment and new definitions of "school" in H.R. 6, Representative Dick Armey (R-TX) offered his own amendment to protect home and private schools from the certification requirement: "Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize or encourage Federal control over the curriculum or practices of any private, religious, or home school." Based upon review of Miller's amendment, the definitional language, and HSLDA's 11 years of defending home schools against legal challenges from local education agencies, Farris felt it was imperative to add protective language to the bill. A quick review of Rep. Miller's voting record showed that he was a staunch supporter of the National Education Association, which had never been favorable to home schoolers. That evening, the National Center for Home Education launched a nationwide fax alert containing the same information to home school leaders around the country.</paragraph><paragraph parID="510">Across America, home schoolers called radio stations, faxed letters, and distributed literature on the Rep. Armey's "Home School/Private School Freedom Amendment." A mother's love is an irresistible force, and the compulsory attendance laws are hardly an immovable object. When nineteenth century parents claimed a right to force their children to work in the potato fields instead of sending them to school, it was easy for society to insist that a child's right to an education outweighed the parent's right to the child's income. But when twentieth century parents claimed a right to give their children a better education than that in the public schools, society lost its will to resist. Home schoolers have gone forth on the courage of their convictions, and the opposing forces of government have melted away at their advance. Time after time, the schools have found a way to work around the law, or, if the case goes to court, the judge has found the way, or, if the case is lost, the legislature finds the way, or, if the legislature refuses to act, the family moves on to another state. The survey differentiated public schoolers from home schoolers and both religious and non-religious private schoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="511">By comparing differences in family participation in these various forms of civic involvement, Smith and Sikkink found that home school families and private school families are consistently more involved in all of the civic activities examined than are families with children in public schools. In fact, by an average margin of 9.3%, the private and home school families are more likely than the public school families to engage in any listed forms of civic participation. Up to 13% more private and home schoolers have given money to political causes and up to 15% more have voted in recent elections and telephoned elected officials. An amazing 26% more private and home school families are members of community groups and volunteer at local organizations. The researchers conclude that home schoolers and private schoolers are "definitely not the isolated recluses that critics suggest they might be. The empirical evidence is clear and decisive: private schoolers and home schoolers are considerably more involved in the public square than are public schoolers-even when the effects of differences in education, income, and other related factors are removed from the equation. Indeed, we have reason to believe that the organizations and practices involved in private and home schooling, in themselves, tend to foster public participation in civic affairs . . . the challenges, responsibilities, and practices that private schooling and home education normally entail for their participants may actually help reinvigorate America's civic culture and the participation of our citizens in our public square.</paragraph><paragraph parID="512">Of all types of nonpublic education, home schooling as a practice-by so closely uniting home, family, education, and (usually) religious faith-might seem the most privatized and isolated from the concerns of the public sphere. It is rather the public schooling families that are clearly the least civicly involved of all the schooling types." When segmented by gender, test scores for home schoolers reveal that boys are slightly better in math (the 84th percentile versus the 79th percentile), and girls are somewhat better in reading (the 88th percentile versus the 87th percentile). Public school student performance in math follows a similar pattern, but public school boys&#146; reading scores are markedly behind girls&#146;, the 43rd percentile versus the 58th percentile &#151; a 15 point difference (Figure 7.0). Parents must have at least a high school diploma or GED. Parents need only test if they are homeschooling under local school district supervision. Those homeschooling with a homeschool association need not test.</paragraph><paragraph parID="513">180 instructional days per year, each at least four and one-half hours long. Curriculum includes, but is not limited to, the basic instructional areas of reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies and in grades seven through twelve, composition and literature. "Private school" means a school established by an agency other than the State or its subdivisions which is primarily supported by other than public funds, and the operation of whose program rests with other than publicly elected or appointed officials. ~From Dianna, Editor, Carolina Homeschooler . Homeschooling programs (A) Parents or guardians may teach their children at home if the instruction is approved by the district board of trustees of the district in which the children reside. A district board of trustees shall approve homeschooling programs which meet the following standards:</paragraph><paragraph parID="514">(1) the parent: (a) holds at least a high school diploma or the equivalent general educational development (GED) certificate and, beginning in the 1989-90 school year, attains a passing score on the basic skills examination developed pursuant to Section 59-26-20 (b) (1) after the State Department of Education has validated the test for use with homeschooling parents; or (b) has earned a baccalaureate degree; Note: As a result of Lawrence v South Carolina State Board. of Education (1991, SC), the requirement of (a) passing score on the basic skills examination or (b) obtaining a baccalaureate degree was repealed. In other words, parents must hold at least a high school diploma or the equivalent general educational development (GED) certificate. For more information, see CASE NOTES following this section.</paragraph><paragraph parID="515">(2) the instructional day is at least four and one-half hours, excluding lunch and recesses, and the instructional year is at least one hundred and eighty days; (3) the curriculum includes, but is not limited to, the basic instructional areas of reading, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies and in grades seven through twelve, composition and literature; (4) as evidence that a student is receiving regular instruction, the parent shall present a system for maintaining and maintain the following records for inspection upon reasonable notice by a representative of the school district: (a) a plan book, diary, or other written record indicating subjects taught and activities in which the student and parent engage; (b) a portfolio of samples of the student's academic work; and (c) a record of evaluations of the student's academic progress. A semiannual progress report including attendance records and individualized assessments of the student's academic progress in each of the basic instructional areas specified in item (3) must be submitted to the school district. (5) students must have access to library facilities; (6) students must participate in the annual statewide testing program and the Basic Skills Assessment Program approved by the State Board of Education for their appropriate grade level.</paragraph><paragraph parID="516">The tests must be administered by a certified school district employee either with public school students or by special arrangement at the student's place of instruction, at the parent's option. The parent is responsible for paying the test administrator if the test is administered at the student's home; and (7) parents must agree in writing to hold the district, the district board of trustees and the district's employees harmless for any educational deficiencies of the student sustained as a result of home instruction. At any time the school district determines that the parent is not maintaining the homeschool program in keeping with the standards specified in this section the district board of trustees shall notify the parent to correct the deficiencies within thirty days. (B) The district board of trustees shall provide for an application process which elicits the information necessary for processing the homeschooling request, including a description of the program, the texts and materials to be used, the methods of program evaluation, and the place of instruction. Parents must be notified in advance of the date, place, and time of the meeting at which the application is considered by the board and parents may be heard at the meeting. (C) Within the first fifteen instructional days of the public school year, students participating in home instruction and eligible for enrollment in the first grade of the public schools must be tested to determine their readiness for first grade using the readiness instrument approved by the State Board of Education for public school students.</paragraph><paragraph parID="517">If a student is determined to be "not ready" or is determined to lack the necessary emotional maturity, the parent must be advised by appropriate school district personnel whether a kindergarten or a first grade curriculum should be used for the child. Nothing in this section may be interpreted to conflict a parent's right to exempt his child from kindergarten as provided in Section 59-65-10 (A). (D) Should a student in a homeschooling program score below the test requirements of the promotion standard prescribed for public school students by the State Board of Education for one year, the district board of trustees shall decide whether or not the student shall receive appropriate instructional placement in the public school, special services as a handicapped student, or homeschooling with an instructional support system at parental expense. The right of a parent to enroll his child in a private or parochial school as provided in Section 59-65-10 (A) is unaffected by this provision. (E) If a parent is denied permission to begin or continue homeschooling by a district board of trustees, the decision of the district board of trustees may be appealed, within ten days, to the State Board of Education. Any appeal from the decision of the State Board of Education must be taken, within thirty days, to the family court. The requirement that a parent who provides a homeschooling program to his or her child must pass the basic skills examination (EEE) is unenforceable, since the process for validating the examination failed to meet the standard of reasonableness where the EEE did not test teaching ability, the panel who evaluated each item of the EEE for task relatedness and bias were not given a description of successful homeschooling, and the scores given the examination by those who were homeschooler versus those who were not was substantially different.</paragraph><paragraph parID="518">Removing one's child from public school and starting to homeschool can be a daunting task for many parents. If you have a child with special needs and/or learning disabilities, that move can be downright intimidating! This option provides the most flexibility, but many families new to homeschooling may encounter problems when requesting your child's records from their previous school. There is a lot of misinformation provided to families who wish to homeschool their special needs children. The following points should be kept in mind, as you prepare to embark on your family's homeschooling journey. It is not illegal to homeschool a child with special needs. You do not need any special permission from any agency in order to homeschool your special needs child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="519">Being a credentialed teacher (special education or otherwise) is not required in order to homeschool your special needs child. If you have questions about homeschooling, your best resource is a local or state homeschooling organization. Do not contact your local school district, the state department of education, or any public educational institution - they will just confuse (and possibly, intimidate you). Public schools do not like to lose students with IEPs because they receive more state and federal funding for these children. Many schools will put up a fight to prevent parents from removing SPED children. This current page discusses the basics of homeschooling with insights directed toward those whose children have IEPs. There are links to articles, information about IDEA, and resources.</paragraph><paragraph parID="520">The second page in this section offers links to a number of additional resources, but these are organized by common childhood disorders. The last page lists more general resources - about homeschooling differently abled kids, as well as a selection of non-homeschooling websites and books that I have personally found helpful in educating my own Asperger's son. There are no adverts on these pages (or actually, anywhere on the BayShore website) ... all resources have been reviewed by me (or other special needs homeschooling parents whose opinions I trust). Parents who are new to homeschooling need to be able to make decisions without having expensive "cures" dangled before their eyes. As you all probably know by now ... there are no cures ... but, there are helpful resources to make life just a little bit easier. This webpage is similar to our page, Getting Started with Homeschooling - except that this one is specific to those whose children have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) currently in place with a public school. The information contained on this website is specific to those residing in California.</paragraph><paragraph parID="521">While there are numerous organizations serving special education children, many of them are simply unaware of homeschooling laws. Please be advised that enrolling special needs children in a private school such as BayShore will discontinue any special services/therapies provided by the public school system. IDEA states that children enrolled in non-public schools are only eligible for public school consultation services. These services vary from school to school, but they generally consist of a monthly meeting with the special education teacher/director, etc. Your child's IEP can be closed - however, you can still go through the process as a private school student, in which case, the IEP is referred to as a "service plan." So, before you remove your child please make sure that you are willing to give up his/her SPED services! Homeschooling and IDEA</paragraph><paragraph parID="522">One of the most frequently asked questions regarding home education and special needs children is whether free services will be provided through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Check out the Council for Exceptional Children's Advocacy webpage . Children in California who homeschool do so either by enrolling in a public charter program, enrolling in a private school independent study program, or by filing the private school affidavit (PSA, also known as R-4, for the form number). However, many charter programs will not accept students with IEPs. Enrollment in a private school (either the private ISP or filing the R-4) will disqualify children from special education (SPED) services through the public schools. For more information on the IDEA guidelines regarding SPED students who have been parentally placed in a private school, please read IDEA- Part B Final Regulations: Parentally-Placed Children in Private Schools. Association of Homeschool Attorneys This association is a network of attorneys and legal experts that concerned with litigation pending and threatened against homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="523">Its primary purpose is to exchange legal information within the profession, and to educate and support attorneys and experts involved in homeschool litigation. Choose a Legal Option The first thing you will need to do is to determine the legal option under which you plan to homeschool. In California, there are four options: &#8226; File Your Own    Private School Affidavit (R-4) &#8226; Enroll in a Private School that offers    an independent study program (ISP or PSP) &#8226; Enroll in a Public ISP or Charter &#8226; Tutoring Option for Those    with Teaching Credentials You can read about the basics of these options on the Getting Started in Homeschooling webpage , but there are some issues related to each option that are specific for IEP'd children. Also on the Getting Started page are checklists for filing the R-4, enrolling in charter and private ISPs - you just need to choose your option, and follow the step-by-step lists.</paragraph><paragraph parID="524">Filing the R-4 Officials may balk at forwarding the records because they are unaware of the private school laws and/or feel that parents are not capable of educating their own children. If you think that this could occur in your family's situation, it may be best to enroll with private ISP for your first year or so. Once your child's records have been received by the private ISP and after you feel more comfortable homeschooling, many families will file their own R-4. It is much easier to obtain records from a private ISP, and it has served as a buffer between you and the public school. Private ISP There are many of these programs throughout the state - some are faith-based (requiring a statement of faith) while others are nonsectarian (they will accept families of any faith) or secular.</paragraph><paragraph parID="525">These programs have already filed the R-4 with the state and they operate as a business. Children enroll in these programs in the same manner as with any private school. The program's administrator/principal will request your child's records from his/her previous school. The tuition for these programs vary in cost. The more expensive ones provide curriculum and possibly, teacher support. Many of the smaller, more cost-effective ISPs will provide assistance with learning plans, if requested. Next to filing your own R-4, this option provides you with the most flexibility - depending on the program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="526">Read an article outlining the pros, cons, and tips in choosing a private ISP. Charter Programs/Public ISPs In California, many public charter programs are designed specifically for homeschoolers. While these are public school programs, they operate under a number of different guidelines and individual programs may not provide SPED services. Do not count on these programs to continue the services outlined in your child's IEP. Check with individual programs for their policies regarding service delivery. This is generally not an option that many families follow, simply because they do not possess the necessary credentials.</paragraph><paragraph parID="527">Important Points to Remember Then again ... if your child is a handful (possibly you are as well!) , the school might not care. This is for informational purposes only. Today, many parents prefer homeschooling in order to avoid unsuitable influences that children may be exposed to in public schools as well as issues they may have with educational or religious content. Studies by the National Home Education Research Institute also show that homeschooled children fare noticeably better on tests than their publicly schooled peers. Apart from these factors, homeschooling is a more convenient option for families who live in remote areas or who often relocate, since it allows the child to continuously learn without the ordeal of having their schooling progress interrupted, or for children with special needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="528">Homeschooling involves educating children in the home instead of at a traditional school. Tuition is usually conducted by parents, although some families opt to hire tutors instead. Homeschooling is actually not a modern concept at all. Over the last few centuries in Western culture, it was common for richer classes to hire governesses who lived with the family and taught children a variety of subjects as well as etiquette and how to conduct themselves socially. Parents planning to homeschool must keep in mind that a signed declaration is normally required by law and should take care in preparing and filing official documentation before the start of the new school year. A homeschooling movement began in the United States in the early 1980s, with numbers swelling from a tiny handful to an estimated 3 percent of the total school-aged population by 2007. Research on homeschooling is in its infancy, compared to research on public and private schools, and it poses unique problems to the researcher.</paragraph><paragraph parID="529">Anyone considering preparing an in-depth scholarly work may also want to examine material by homeschooling advocates and practitioners as well as resources on the broader role of families, private schools, and government in education. The author provides an historical analysis linking the rise of homeschooling to dissatisfaction with public schools. The United States accepts it as an alternative to school attendance under compulsory education laws, as do many other nations. Families have engaged in homeschooling before and after the advent of such laws, but the practice became a focus of interest to educators only late in the 20th century. Typically, homeschooling parents plan and supervise the activity, sometimes collaborating with other parents. Children may study under the supervision of someone other than a parent or guardian at a variety of locations, including a public or private school, a homeschooling learning cooperative, a parks department facility, or an institution of higher learning. Some families adopt a philosophy of "unschooling," as explained in the section on Education Theory , and allow children to set the pace and pursue their individual interests.</paragraph><paragraph parID="530">A good overview provides a solid base for an undergraduate student preparing a short paper as well as a starting point for graduate students beginning an intensive study of the subject. It should inform the reader on a broad range of issues, including history, law, demographics, outcomes, and information on the diversity within the homeschooling movement. The author also reports on a substantial movement among public schools to offer part-time enrollment or other services to homeschoolers. Ray 2005 provides a summary of who homeschoolers are, stressing the diversity of their beliefs and practices. Hill 2000 provides an overview that places homeschooling within the context of broad education movements, and predicts that homeschoolers will collaborate to establish a new kind of private school. A general overview focusing on the impact of homeschooling on public schools. He predicts homeschoolers are likely to create new school-like institutions and that many will accept help from public programs, preferably from charter and voucher programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="531">Discusses the weaknesses of available data, including data on academic achievement, but finds no evidence that the average homeschooler suffers academically. Online home school programs are a way to take learning from the classroom to the home via the Internet. The Internet delivers the school, the courses and the teachers to the students' homes. They also learn to socialize with people of different ages because homeschool students are not limited to interacting with only people their own age, as in a traditional classroom setting. These programs also help children who do not excel in a classroom setting or children who need more one-on-one attention than the average classroom setting provides. Is homeschooling being used to supplement public school? If homeschooling is only a temporary arrangement, parents may be able to borrow materials from a local school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="532">Another benefit of home school programs is that it allows children to learn at their own pace and can be tailored to their needs. Lastly, home school programs are a transportation convenience especially if a family is limited to one car. Is homeschooling short or long-term? Once parents determine the answers to these types of questions they will know what to look for in selecting a home school program. Determine how a particular worldview will be part of the home school experience . Since some home school programs are specifically Christian, parents will want to consider how, or if, religious views are included. Choosing to Home School: Q &amp;amp; A with parents who chose to home school their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="533">Not having spent my formative years constantly surrounded by children my own age, I now have the ability to communicate comfortably with people of all ages instead of just my peers. Sara above has witnessed the socialisation pitfalls that *can* (not necessarily *do*) come with homeschooling. I intend to send my children to public school. I will pray every day that they do not have to endure the trials I faced, but if they do, that God will give them the strength that He gave me. If things become too difficult for them, I will switch to homeschooling, but I'm going to give them a chance to stand strong so that others may see Christ in them. Instructing a child in truth is the primary reason for choosing an educational method, whether that method be homeschooling, public school, or private school. With regard to the instructional aspect of this discussion, can anyone point to studies about the educational outcomes comparing the various educational modes?</paragraph><paragraph parID="534">My own anecdotal experience with homeschooling is mildly unfavourable on results grounds. I'll explain: My family on my mother's side have generally lived in Australia, although all but one of her siblings' families have lived and worked overseas at some point. I spent five and a half years living in England and Switzerland with my family, whereas one of my cousins spent roughly a year and a half in Quebec in Canada. As our family's posting was known to be long-term, I went to a local public school in England (and prior to that in Australia) and an English-speaking, secular, international private school in Switzerland. My cousin and her siblings on the other hand weren't able to attend public school in Quebec due to the language barrier, and for reasons which I've never asked about, their parents chose to homeschool. Their mother is a qualified teacher who had taught in public schools in Australia prior to this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="535">I completed my schooling in Switzerland and returned to Australia to attend university. My cousin's family returned home after the end of their posting. Since my cousin and two of her siblings were very close to graduation, it was decided that they would continue with homeschooling, while a younger sibling attended a private Christian school and later a public school to finish his education. (Again, there were probably other factors in making these decisions that I am not aware of.) My cousin and I attended the two largest universities in Brisbane, Australia, and in order to do so any high school qualifications have to be assessed and converted into a standard scale, as the majority university placements are based solely on academic results in Australia. The conversion attempts to compare different qualifications such as American SAT scores (which are what my cousin obtained), the UK's A-Levels, France's Baccalaureate, the International Baccalaureate (IB), which was my own qualification, and the results from local Australian schools. Based on the conversion, we both achieved very high results, but not the same; her rank was a few points lower than my own.</paragraph><paragraph parID="536">This would supposedly indicate a greater academic aptitude on my part. However our university results, now that we have both graduated, refute this quite starkly. My cousin is far more diligent, conscientious, and frankly, probably more intelligent than me. Her university results reflect this; out of a possible total of 224 marks across her entire degree, she obtained 223. I, on the other hand, only got 206 out of a possible 238. While both forms of education prepared us to excel in our later educational careers, her results from homeschooling were not truly indicative of her educational and intellectual potential. As I said at the start, this is anecdotal, but I would be interested to hear comparisons of the systems in terms of educational and assessment outcomes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="537">As an example, what proportion of homeschoolers attend and graduate from college, as compared to the general population? While we are eager to facilitate civil conversation by publishing most comments, we're inclined not to publish those that strike us as offensive, vulgar, overly personal, cynical, snarky, deceptive, disrespectful, irrelevant, redundant or unnecessarily contentious. Tim Challies stirred up some conversation a couple of days ago when he began a defense of his decision to have his children "educated through the public school system." Regardless of the incendiary title, the thing that concerns me about his position is that his motivation is not to educate his children in the traditional sense -- he doesn't mention teachers or philosophy or methodology or curriculum -- but to send them into an environment hostile to the Christian faith with the hope that they will be salt and light, and toughen them up against the allure of worldliness. I believe an educational system should give children the tools to think critically and the information on which to act with those tools, all within a worldview grounded in truth and love, the motivation being to better understand God and His creation, with the ultimate goal being to engage the Lord and humanity in ways that best honor the Lord and make the best use of the talents He's given us. Homeschoolers need to not be so quick to condemn those who've chosen to delegate that responsibility to others, and non-homeschoolers need to stop ridiculing those who choose the counter-cultural route of managing that education themselves at home. As a homeschooled kid who is now starting to think about marriage, I can see how homeschooling made me more insular than I may otherwise have been (although that's also a function of my personality, and I can't blame homeschooling for that entirely).</paragraph><paragraph parID="538">Also, I have never been one to have more than one "best friend" at a time, so now that I'm married, my husband fills that spot and I don't have a really good girl-friend like I did throughout highschool and my first two years of college (which was a private university that started as a Catholic women's college and is now as secular as anywhere else, but that's another story). As a victim of the public school system -- a clueless child who wanted desperatly to cling to God but was bruised and battered on account of my simple faith, who was told by a teacher not to talk about Jesus and instructed by another teacher to sit in a circle around candles in a dark room -- I have the very strong opinion that any parent that makes the "choice" to send their innocent babies into this lion's den is not really thinking about their children. As for the socialization MYTH!!! And had I not been forced into the social setting that came with school, I probably wouldn't have gotten over it by the time I was 13 (which is when I began to come through). I'm also able to interact with people of different ages very successfully. In response, I began a similar series entitled " Why I Will Homeschool ," in which I argue that the philosophy behind the systems and methodologies should be front and center when we make such an important decision for our children. I think one of the main reasons there is so much heated discussion is because of the way Tim framed his argument: Instead of merely stating why he is delegating primary responsibility of his children's education to the state, he instead begins by saying that he is specifically not homeschooling them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="539">In other words, the title of his series implies that he is not sending his children to public schools because they are superior to other educational contexts, but he has chosen not to homeschool his children because of inherent flaws in that system. I spend 12 years in the public school system, and had some wonderful teachers and wonderful experiences. My sister teaches in the public school system, and has been a blessing to her students. As I look forward to having kids, as it stands right now, I'm definately considering public schools, although I'm not sure I would want to send them to the schools I am local to right now -- what I know of the curriculum concerns me. One thing that I think homeschooling "helped" me to be is less social outside of my family. Even though my family is flawed and can get on my nerves at times, I have always spent more time with those related to me over people I meet otherwise. Even though I am doing college work, I'm still involved with the local homeschool community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="540">disagreeing with homeschooling rather than promoting public schooling). Also, in reference to A LaLande's comment "And for another, as one veteran homeschooler told me with a smile, reasons such as Mr. Challies uses are usually the last ditch arguments you hear before they "cave" and decide to homeschool after all!" Pulling me out and homeschooling me -- after being emotionally and physically abused in public school -- was the best thing my parents could have ever done. While you have obviously had a bad experience with a public school, this does not make all children in similar schools "wretched little creatures" who are being indoctrinated against God and their parents by nasty teachers who don't care for them at all. My personal expirience (i'm not at all saying that all expiriences are like mine) with public school is that i was introduced to many positive academic ventures that my parents could not have introduced me to in the same way. I learned about english and literature from two women who felt passionately about this subject. I learned about art and fine tuned my drawing skills from an art teacher who saw great potential in my work, and had the knowledge about how to place my work in competitions that resulted in awards and scholarships.</paragraph><paragraph parID="541">I learned about power tools in the wood shop from a teacher who had expirience in that area. This is all knowledge that my parents could not have given me because they were not interested in these areas. They knew that there were areas in education that others could provide better than they could. On the other - many (not all) of the students here who have been homeschooled have no understanding of life outside of Christianity. One thing that well-educated parents aiming to homeschool often forget in this debate, is that they are often well educated and thereby equipped to teach their children precisely because of their involvement with the established institutions. I have met many young adults who were homeschooled and have seen them try to navigate the real world after spending their entire education surrounded by only Christians . Are they incredibly smart and well-educated...yes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="542">Socially inept...ABSOLUTELY! When it came time for our college-age ministry to seek out unbelievers and share the Gospel with them it became very clear to me the pitfalls of homeschooling your children. They could not relate to anyone who had grown up in a secular public schooled household. It cemented my decision that when I have children...they will attend public school. If you're concerned about your kids' social skills, I think you would homeschool them differently than parents who want to keep them in a Christian bubble. Samuel, by the same logic, the people who made such great "established systems" were homeschooled in the days before there were institutional schools, and thus stood on the "shoulders" of homeschooling. Perhaps it all boils down to our thoughts about the proper role of an educational system.</paragraph><paragraph parID="543">OK, that was a pretty long and awkward sentence. Sorry about that. On the other hand, I don't think teaching our children truth should take a back seat to requiring that they be young missionaries sent into a hostile environment, hoping that (like a vaccine helps us develop an immunity to the flu) they're able to build up a resistance to worldliness. I'm all for missions; I spent about a year in the jungles of Mexico doing what some might label "missions work." I want my kids to have the same heart for reaching out to the unsaved, whether in the States or another country, and I'll encourage those opportunities. I also struggle to grow in discernment and try to be on guard against the creep of worldliness into my heart. My wife and I'll impress that on our kids as well, through "teachable moments" and the more formal homeschooling process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="544">I think there are better ways for our kids to engage others with the gospel and build up their anti-worldliness muscles than immersing them in a system built on a foundation that says God is irrelevant. I'm not wholesale against tax-funded schools. What I'm saying is that we need to think long and hard about the development of those over whom the Lord has given us responsibility -- our children -- and how we can best bring them up in the knowledge of the Lord and His creation. Some choose homeschooling; others choose private or public schooling to accomplish that end. In the end, as I've mentioned, parents have been given the authority to direct the education of their children. I have no reason to doubt that Tim and his wife, though they've delegated that authority to others, are wonderful parents and will nevertheless be closely involved in their kids' education. I just wish he wouldn't have felt the need to diminish those who choose to homeschool in the process, and would have made more clear what he sees as the purpose of education and how his decision will help his kids achieve that end.</paragraph><paragraph parID="545">"I have no reason to doubt that Tim and his wife, though they've delegated that authority to others, are wonderful parents and will nevertheless be closely involved in their kids' education.

I agree with the latter part of this point: one thing I was left wondering is how Challies sees education -- he really doesn't say in that piece. I do fail to see how his posts were inflammatory, though. While he had his criticisms of homeschoolers, I thought they were brought up in a humble manner. This is not to say that I don't greatly enjoy time I spend with non-relative friends, but I don't pursue those opportunities as much as say going to my parents' house to visit. On the other hand, I am pretty sensitive to other people's moods and feelings and have generally been one to try to befriend the "underdog" and reach out to those who may sometimes fall through the cracks when I know they need someone to talk to.</paragraph><paragraph parID="546">So, I may be more of a "home-body" but I'm definitely not anti-social. I'm just not one to go to parties and night clubs like many of the people I went to school with, not that I was really invited to many of those events in the first place. I think Ted's got it right. And he has the ability to clarify the issue too, which I seem to lack when it comes to issues I feel strongly about! Tim Challies' comments WERE inflammatory, I'm afraid. None of the parents would appreciate the way he explains his position. But they wouldn't judge him harshly, either, if they knew him personally.</paragraph><paragraph parID="547">For one thing, they've all been there -- pondering and studying out the best way to bring up their children. And for another, as one veteran homeschooler told me with a smile, reasons such as Mr. Challies uses are usually the last ditch arguments you hear before they "cave" and decide to homeschool after all! But one thing is for sure: homeschooling isn't for everyone. I am glad it WAS for me, though! And for each of my children! I have to say I'm disappointed with Ted arguing with the way Challies' phrased his opinion. I don't see any problems with saying you find a particular sytem flawed, provided you give reasons and don't just run around saying "this is wrong, this is wrong, and this is wrong".</paragraph><paragraph parID="548">- now _you_ are being the superior one, acting like "my system is the best way, and you can't escape it" (ie. in saying people come up with last ditch attempts before "caving".) You are of the wrong attitude if you think homeschooling is something people should cave in to. I hope it's not necessary to qualify that statement. I was lonely and scared and too ashamed to breathe a word. The public school system is all about the indoctrination of children against God, against their parents, against anything remotely related to Christianity -- I know, I was one of those wretched little creatures. Anyone can believe whatever they like, but whether anyone likes it or not, children are going to be affected by a system that upholds all things pagan, and it may not be pretty.</paragraph><paragraph parID="549">I am very sorry that I came across as superior. It is not at all what I intended and I humbly apologize for this. I meant "cave" in a purely humorous way and that the arguments Mr. Challies used have been (I think) masterfully dismissed by homeschool experts long before his blogs on the subject. When an argument such as this comes up, with such polarized extremes, even though I have such strong opinions, I have a difficult time stating them in a manner that is graceful towards all. So now that I've put my foot in my mouth, I guess I may as well explain my position fully. I have been an active observer of homeschool families my entire life - not hard to do, since I was around them constantly. I am the first to say that it is NOT a guarantor of success.</paragraph><paragraph parID="550">(By success, I mean a child who grows up to be a sincere follower of Christ - I don't really count educational honors, as they won't mean a thing when a person stands before God after having rejected Him.) But it is true, (and however narrow-minded I may sound I simply must say it), that I do believe with my whole heart that the best interest of children is found only under the constant guidance of godly and loving parents. I've read the book of Proverbs backwards and forwards for many years and this serves to strengthen my belief on the subject, as of course do the passages in Deuteronomy, Titus, etc. As does my study of history, where I can't seem to find "public school" a common or Christian educational choice anywhere till relatively recently. The public schools of today are godless. The society of peers, whether at public or Christian schools is harmful. If 'foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child' and the 'companion of fools will suffer harm' why do we subject our children to it at all?</paragraph><paragraph parID="551">My love for these innocent children is such that I cannot bear to see them so early defiled and broken by the world. I DO know good Christian people who grew up under that system and in that society. In this fallen world, I have to accept that there is no one-size-fits-all way to grow up unscathed by the deadly effects of sin. But having been born into a background of poverty, sin, and vice, to a mom who is a first-generation Christian (as is my dad, who adopted me after he married Mom - both were divorced), I can vouch personally for the truly incredible work God has done in my family's life. My childhood wasn't an easy one, but it was very blessed by God. The shadows of evil were often cast over me growing up, but I was protected through the influence of Christ as my parents, learning of Him themselves, led me (and my brothers) in the path that indeed is narrow. So yes, I'm a radical and an extremist, but no, I'm not going to say homeschooling is superior.</paragraph><paragraph parID="552">It's not. Only complete giving of oneself to God in every area of life is superior. I can't claim to have done this fully, but I hope to spend my life in the attempt. In choosing to homeschool, I believe that I am doing so as the best way to obey and serve God whenever it is that He blesses me with children. I don't think I'll ever have a graduate degree, or a career, or fame or fortune, but I've learned that those are empty and meaningless when compared to showing a child the way to Christ and how to live a life honoring to Him, which I believe is a parent's most sacred duty. And teaching them the three R's CAN be pretty fun! Contrary to Ted's thoughts that heated discussion has arisen due to Challies' framing of his argument, I think that the heated discussion is due to this issue being a naturally heated one.</paragraph><paragraph parID="553">While I'm here I feel that I must voice some of the offence and indignation that I felt while reading Catherine Ann's comment above. I found this comment to be very emotionally charged, and, while valid, not useful. I am deeply intrigued by the homeschooling debate. After considering a thousand different ways I could continue to expand on this topic, I have decided that I couldn't possibly condense my thoughts adequately, so I might have to leave it for another day. I went through a similar experience as Catherine Ann, though I stayed in public school. I attended public school K-12, and was abused, mocked, and rejected by all my peers, as well as some teachers. I would never trade my public school experience for anything.</paragraph><paragraph parID="554">Some people scoff at the arguement of children being sent to public school as witnesses. But if that situation turns out to not be the best way to instruct in truth a particular child at a particular point in time, then the method of education would change because the primary motivation is the well-being of the child, not missions. I may have never known i had a talant for certain things if it had not been for my teachers, who were part of my community for edification and growth in knowledge. Now the Lord is using the training i had in public schools (primary, secondary, post secondary) to develop me into an architect in one of the nations leading graduate schools for architecture (also a public state school). Shortly i will be traveling to africa to use my skills with tools and hand construction to build a medical center. The positive and appropriate influence of these men and women in my life were invaluable. I'm not denying what my parents taught me at all, nor would I ever say that my parents "delegated the authority" of my education "to others."</paragraph><paragraph parID="555">They were very involved, but they did allow the influence of others, which is a biblical process (i will emphasize that my parents, especially my dad, did not allow me to blindly accept their influences, but test the spirits, of course). My parents, by chosing to send me to public school, afforded me the best opportunity availible by allowing others to speak into my life and teach me great academic knowledge. I know that for me, public school and state school have stretched me, solidified my faith and have given me a love for the lost that I most likely wouldn't have if I couldn't put faces of those I know on things like homosexuality, teen pregnancy, drug usage, etc. This is not a debate about two equal plains -- homeschooling vs publicschooling -- this a battle for children's minds and hearts. And for those who would say public school cannot be compared to these places -- there are many who would beg to differ. However, to say "any parent that makes the "choice" to send their innocent babies into this lion's den is not really thinking about their children." is really very unfair to the millions upon millions of parents who do make this decision.</paragraph><paragraph parID="556">My mother, who is very involved in my old primary school (Religious Ed co-ordinator, Book club co-ordinator, one-day-a-week preschool teacher) is also one of the most respected volunteers at the school-- and, to quote the Christmas card she got from the non-Christian Principal last week, he is "very grateful for the contribution you have to the mental and spiritual growth of our students". "Public school" does not = "lion's den". Was my mother giving me no consideration when she enrolled me in the public schooling system? The first "public" school system was established by the "Old Deluder Satan Act" of 1647 by a bunch of Calvinists who thought that teaching children to read so they could study the bible would help keep them from temptation. Note, I was home schooled, so don't take it as a slam against homeschooling. They will not have continual guidance from their parents any longer. How will they stand without their parents to hold them up?</paragraph><paragraph parID="557">I can't help but think they'd be somewhat naive about society or social situations (and I mean real society, not the cliches you find on TV), unless their parents had gone to great lengths to have them participate in extracurricular activities with other children outside school. In regards to Government, I mean Public Schooling verses Home Schooling. I quote... "I am much afraid that schools will prove to be wide gates to hell unless they diligently labor in explaining the Holy Scriptures, engraving them in the hearts of youth. I was fortunate enough to find friends who were believers, and some of my fondest memories in high school involve our lunchtime debates about a variety of topics (we were Baptist, Catholic, Assembly of God, Methodist, and Episcopalian, among others) that helped me explore and defend my own beliefs more than anything else did. Furthermore, the world itself can be said to be something of a "lion's den," and as Leah pointed out, parents will only be around to protect and guide their children for so long before they grow up and have to face the world on their own. Going to a public school gave me no delusions about what it would be like to be in a secular work environment, and while I relished the time I spent at my Christian college, the "world" I encountered there was a much more sheltered and idyllic world than I now face daily, and I am thankful to God for having had the benefit of being on two sides of the educational spectrum. Actually, my father hadn't realized that I had already written that quote -- we think alike ... but I think the books of Psalms and Deuteronomy are ... I've yet to see anyone quoting Scripture in favor of Public Schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="558">Perhaps their parents had in mind to shelter them from "the evils of the world" and decided that homeschooling would be a good way to facilite it. Homeschooling for High School Making the decision to begin homeschooling your high school student can be difficult and should not be taken lightly. High school homeschooling requires personal sacrifice and a big time commitment. It may also be a financial strain on the parents and reduce your child's socialization. However, homeschooling highschool students does have its advantages. Learn more about homeschooling for high school students, its advantages, disadvantages, and how a student can complete his coursework and obtain a diploma from home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="559">Given the advances in education over the past century, many parents may be concerned about the advantages of homeschooling over traditional schooling. High school homeschooling has increased in popularity due to several reasons. In a large classroom, the educator is not able to give each student the individual attention required for the students to excel. Parents not only know their pupils on a personal level, they are able to provide one-on-one interactions while teaching. Parents who choose to home school also have the option of choosing the curriculum. Real-life experiences can be taught out of the classroom, such as: managing money, woodworking, cooking, and shopping on a budget. Home school hours are often shorter than traditional school hours, as there is less time not spent on academic subjects.</paragraph><paragraph parID="560">When unnecessary writing, waiting for recess and lunch, and waiting in lines is cut out from the day, must homeschooling parents can complete the coursework in two to three hours per day. Despite the numerous advantages of homeschooling, there are several disadvantages that should be addressed. The most significant disadvantages for many parents is the time and finance that homeschooling requires on a consistent basis. Time is needed to prepare the curriculum, lesson plans, and activities, as well as teach, and organize field trips. This type of set-up may not work well with some families, as parents have little time for themselves. Another major disadvantage of high school home school is the cost. Parents are primarily responsible for purchasing the curriculum and any costs that field trips and other activities average, as opposed to free public schooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="561">The final disadvantage of homeschooling high school students is their lack of social interaction. When separated from their peers, they are not always able to form friendships with kids their own age. This may not be a problem with all homeschooling families, as long as the student has ample opportunities to spend time with other teenagers. Completing Coursework There are some instances where a child cannot or does not attend regular public or private schools. For this reason, there are several options for parents who want to home school high school students. Many parents choose accredited programs so that their child is receiving the same education as other children of their age, but at their own pace.</paragraph><paragraph parID="562">Parents and students are also able to telephone their teachers to receive additional help. Another similar option is a pre-packaged curriculum. These provide a chosen curriculum of lesson plans, activities, and developmental skills that will be required for your students' age group. Other homeschooling options include online learning. This may include an online classroom environment with other students or one-on-one tutoring from a professional home-school educator. Obtaining a Diploma There are many ways that home school students can obtain a high school diploma.</paragraph><paragraph parID="563">Parents decide when their child has mastered the curriculum that they have set-up. Some parents choose a more structured curriculum, similar to that of a public or private school, while other parents teach their children until they feel that they have reached the point of readiness for college. Getting your actual diploma can be done in a variety of ways. Some parents decide to make their own. Others decide to order from a company that provides high school diplomas for private and home school students. Those who choose accredited online or campus-based schools can typically obtain their diploma from the school directly. Each of these options will depend on personal options, but are all legal and count as valid high school diplomas.</paragraph><paragraph parID="564">Additional Resources For more information on high school home study and how to complete home school high school courses in order to obtain a diploma, see the following resources.

Types of Distant Education : Information on various types of distant education, such as virtual high schools and distributed classes. Accredited home schools typically have the same curriculum of those of public school. The children are judged by two parents attending the fair, and at the end of the competition the children are given a ribbon based on their score of Good, Superior or Excellent. I graduated from homeschool so I am familiar with the benefits of the traditional method but I know nothing about cyber school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="565">We are looking for something that will give us the flexibility to travel with my husband (he is an OTR truck driver). I am somewhat unsure about providing the same level of education that he would receive in a normal school setting, so the cyber school appeals to me on that aspect. When I asked them separately to make a list of pros and cons, they each had somewhere on that list, 'homeschooled kids like their siblings more.' They had realized it before I had. It is one of my biggest blessing on this journey." Regretfully I can't read all the students' essays and discussion questions, but I try to read a selection of them.

Christian Schools And Homeschooling Homeschooling is frowned upon by the public schools and by political governments for obvious reasons. Since the federal government funds the public school system based upon the number of children in the schools, it would be obvious that the public schools would much prefer having all children in the public schools for reasons of--money. Human societies generally dictate that all children within a nation must be educated, and basically in public schools. When I read the The Communist Manifesto years ago, I learned that the "ten planks" of that manifesto have long been in existence within the United States and other "free" countries. Anyone who has never read about the "ten planks" and who keys into the Internet and reads those ten points, will be appalled (and we have been led to believe that we live in a society of "freedom").</paragraph><paragraph parID="568">The tenth plank of that manifesto is free public school education (and no doubt with ulterior motives). Human governments look upon children as a public resource, and they want your children indoctrinated and programmed to be conformists. Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt, former Senior Policy Advisor in the U.S. Department of Education, published a massive volume about public education in the United States titled, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America . In this very extensive and highly documented writing, Charlotte exposes deliberate and intentional policies within public "education" that have been highly detrimental to millions of children. Teachers are also indoctrinated, and in turn, they pass on to future generations programmed "education" that is designed to fulfill the agenda of Godless atheism and humanism. Life has taught me that virtually all human governments play the role of God in the lives of society, and the abuses are staggering. Many politicians, advisers and public policy personnel are not Christians, and therefore to believe that such people have the capacity or ability to make decisions that all of society should be forced to live with, is ludicrous and lugubrious.</paragraph><paragraph parID="569">Not only that, but even among "Christians" in power and control, the abuses are at times very discouraging. Using the name of "Christian" does not automatically make for good policies or decisions. Life in this world is ever changing, and in a lifetime, we all see unending man-made evolutionary changes impacting society. The America that older people came to know as children is a radically different country today. We are all slaves to self-appointed rulers of mankind, through their innumerable controls and man-made laws. Personally, my views on the education of children are very different than the public school system or "Christian" schools. Christian schools are really very much patterned after the public schools in many ways, except that religion plays a role in that environment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="570">Some Christian teachers are very likable and very qualified as teachers (much the same as public schools), while others are not, and some are very disliked among children and parents alike. It is my personal contention that society robs children of childhood through the compulsory school system. They are made to be little robots sitting obediently in rows of chairs, with the expectation of being programmed by the system. The obvious reason for homeschooling is because many parents also believe that children are the responsibility of parents, and not the government or the churches. Any normal parent has the capacity to teach their own children to read, write and do basic math, and to learn about many things. From my perspective, the question about the purpose of life has to be carefully thought through, because it is a guarantee that ultimately, all humans will exit this world. The government says that children need to be "socialized" and they are not "balanced" unless they go to school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="571">It is nothing more than men who have appointed themselves as the guardians of people, resources and life, through man-made laws and force. Christian schools or religious schools are no guarantee that abuse does not happen. It happens, because whether "Christian" or not, people are still human, with human nature. We forever hear "it's the law, it's the law, it's the law" and it is by fear, threat, intimidation, force and violence that these man-made "laws" exist. In the church world, people are subjected to authoritarianism, much the same as in the secular world, and that authoritarianism spills over into the "Christian" schools. I once read an essay published on the Internet titled Letters to Jessica--A Child's Guide to Freedom of Mind and Spirit by Robert Bissett, which places an understanding upon human "governments" and "rulers" into a perspective that is crystal clear, and proving that the only real source of government is God. It is well worth the time to read.</paragraph><paragraph parID="572">Teaching children to THINK, QUESTION, ANALYZE and use COMMON SENSE and to LOOK TO JESUS CHRIST is far more valuable to their lives than CONFORMITY to human rulers and their "way that seems right." There is a plethora of homeschooling materials available in our world today, and there are many different paths which parents take. "Unschooling" is among those materials. Homeschooling, like opting out of childhood vaccinations, has become very widespread in our society today, as parents become better and better informed. Virtual Schools and Homeschooling Freedom Virtual public schools have finally come to Massachusetts, in the form of the Massachusetts Virtual Academy at Greenfield. By contrast, homeschoolers do not accept public monies, are not on the rolls of the public schools, and retain responsibility for and decision-making power over their children's education. Homeschoolers particularly prize this freedom, and retaining the legal right to exercise it is of prominent importance to homeschoolers as well as to the retention of vibrancy and diversity in the palette of educational choices.</paragraph><paragraph parID="573">Clarity about the differences between homeschools and public virtual schools is essential in achieving that objective. Differences between homeschoolers and virtual school students in Massachusetts Schools in Massachusetts receive no per pupil funding for homeschoolers, but when homeschoolers enroll in virtual public schools and change their status to public school students, the school district in which the virtual school is based gets the funding. Meanwhile, the actual cost to the virtual public school is much lower than for a student who attends the brick-and-mortar building, since the child is at home and only needs minimal equipment, materials, and oversight by teachers. In it, she makes a case for creating virtual schools as a way of drawing homeschoolers back into the system: "The development of programs for home study offered by public schools will also contribute to the growth of home-based education. Virtual school students who were formerly homeschoolers may want to retain that label. Since public charter and e-schools began popping up, there has been national concern about whether these new entities will present a threat to homeschool freedoms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="574">The key point The most important point in any discussion of public virtual schools and homeschools is that they are two different things. When a child is enrolled in a public virtual school, that child is a public school student, and must report to the school according to the virtual school's requirements, as well as take state assessment tests, including MCAS. The family is no longer in charge of determining how and when their child is educated. When a child is enrolled in a public virtual school, that family is receiving a curriculum funded by public monies and appropriate accountability for all parties is in play. Public virtual schoolers Public school students</paragraph><paragraph parID="575">May choose method of education Must use curriculum provided Produce their children's evaluations Must be evaluated by school Don't take MCAS Must take MCAS Don't accept public monies</paragraph><paragraph parID="576">Accept public monies The bottom line The creation of public virtual schools is attractive to private companies for financial reasons. A school district in Massachusetts creating a virtual school may also be motivated by financial reasons, because that district can receive per pupil funding for any out-of-district students who enroll. Virtual schools also provide a way for public schools to draw homeschoolers into the public school system. This has been written about extensively by Patricia Lines in papers and publications including "Support for Home-Based Education." In other states with public virtual schools, homeschoolers have been targeted as a potential market for enrollment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="577">AHEM supports every family's right to choose how their child will be educated, but in this case it is important that families understand that they are being directly marketed to by the combination of a for-profit entity and a public school district that is seeking to regain funding. Families should assess the option as carefully as they would evaluate any other advertised product. Claims of "free" curriculum and computers, for instance, may have strings attached, in that they may only be on loan for the duration of the child's enrollment. Parents should read carefully between the lines to determine the validity of these advertising claims. However, for the sake of clarity and accuracy, correct language is important. Acceptance of and respect for all educational choices is fundamental to getting along and fostering an environment where diversity in education is seen as a vital and necessary part of our society. Understanding the difference between and maintaining clarity about the ever-changing educational choices available to families in Massachusetts is a key step in protecting those options for all.</paragraph><paragraph parID="578">The information on this website does not constitute legal advice; it is provided for informational purposes only. We are still a proportionately small movement, and we need one another. As for the former sensation, she is correct in emphasizing the fact that homeschoolers should be wary of the terms dyslexic or dyslexia, as they currently are bandied about by public school people. In truth, there are so many different contradictory, and/or experimentally invalidated definitions of these terms, as they are posed by the public school establishment, that they have become nonfunctional. Unfortunately, Dr. Fuller unnecessarily persists in the use of the terms in several parts of her interview commentary (e.g., she refers to "severely dyslexic kids") without offering her readers definitions of them that she feels are supportable. Homeschoolers should know that it is far more legitimate and practical to discontinue use of the terms, and to replace them with accounts of specific reading disabilities a given child exhibits. In addition, Dr. Fuller mentions some experimental research findings of the 1970s that she claims proves that if children who have not learned to read "come from homes with a lot of books and where there is a tremendous emphasis on reading," they readily "figure out how to teach themselves to read when they get into adolescence."</paragraph><paragraph parID="579">That is a dangerous message to send to homeschoolers, however, since it is an experimentally invalid one at present. Today, it is well-established empirically that a "Matthew effect" takes place in this regard. As the Bible says, people who make gains early on in life tend to prosper at later times. In like fashion, children who from school entry onward make satisfactory progress in learning to read, tend to be able readers during their future years in school. Children who do not , do not, it almost always is found. On the other hand, to her credit, Dr. Fuller is well aware of the degree to which the popular but experimentally unconfirmed Whole Language (WL) approach to teaching reading in public schools systematically denies children full opportunity to read. As the aptly observes, WL instruction is "a disaster" in that regard.</paragraph><paragraph parID="580">Why, then, do public educators persist in conducting ineffectual WL reading lessons? As the astutely notes, the fact is these educators make up "an entrenched monopoly" that does not have to be accountable for the ineffectiveness of its teaching of reading, doubtless is a factor at work in this respect. And, it is apparent that the monopoly "makes a lot of money off these [reading disability] diseases" with which it claims children failing to learn to read are afflicted. Dr. Fuller's observation that children's nonsuccess in gaining reading skills also creates more "job security" for public school teachers is true, although the situation is tragically ironical. Homeschoolers also can be assured that the early emphasis that Dr. Fuller's program puts on developing children's conscious awareness of the alphabet and speech sounds is experimentally corroborated for developing both reading and spelling skills. The two best predictors (in the following order) of how well beginning readers will progress are (1) their phonemic awareness (conscious awareness of the speech sounds in spoken words, and (2) their knowledge of letters. The fact her reading program recommends direct, intensive, systematic, early, and comprehensive (DISEC) instruction of a prearranged sequence of discrete reading skills puts it into conformity with the relevant scientific evidence on how children best learn to read.</paragraph><paragraph parID="581">Year after year, hundreds of thousands of homeschooling families succeed without the intervention and validation of public school teachers. As an independent family evolves to homeschooling maturity-say, two, three or four years along the journey-it comes to recognize that the adventure is richer because the family has complete ownership of it. Families grow stronger and students grow stronger when they are left to figure out for themselves what an education is and how to make it happen. They try, they fail, they triumph, they experiment, they analyze, they storm, they resolve, and ultimately they create themselves. In contrast, a public independent study program dis-empowers families. It creates unnecessary dependency. For a learner, five other personalities, with their varying potentials, paces, learning styles, and interests, are a complete hindrance to individual achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="582">From the point of view of the state, making kids do everything in groups serves to keep that dangerous commodity, individuality, at bay. I saw first-hand the harm can be done to families by power-happy government employees making up their own rules. I've even witnessed some of them inventing new laws on the spot when it served their purposes. Many of these bureaucrats aren't as nice as Ms. Kealoha. Some of them have vindictive minds and even sicker spirits. And all of them command the authority of the state, the very same state that can take away children and throw people into prison cells. In light of that, I prefer to keep all the phantoms of the state out of my home, and I recommend that my readers do the same.</paragraph><paragraph parID="583">The purpose of homeschool to me is being able to teach our children the way we as parents see fit. But however, online schooling through a public school is not controlled by the parent, I tried it myself for my teenage son; he quit because it was too much like public school. Students still answer to a public school teacher. As a traditional homeschooler you do not have to seek permission from anyone but yourself or you have the opportunity to ask a home professional who has home schooled their child for a number of years. On the other hand, some online schools like charter schools give you more freedom than that of online school. If you online school through a public school, the public school...they count your child as part of the school district and they get paid for it. My decision to home school my children was to be able to bring the Christian faith into my schooling, you can't get that in public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="584">Public online school is made to take away the original intent to homeschool. In contradicting to your opinion on home schooling...Many home schoolers these days are enrolled in "public home schools." Most parents do not have teacher credentials, but the teachers in an overseeing organization generally do. The first, and most common, argument against home schooling is socialization. Anti-home schoolists fear and/or outright state that children taught at home will lack social skills developed among their peers which serve as overseers, planners, and facilitators, while leaving the actual teaching largely or entirely up to the family...the number of extra curricular activities of a home schooler is less thus the individual will have limited capabilities in the competitive world....however the merits and demerits of home schooling must be clearly understood before drawing any conclusion. I think that the public charter schools and online schools make it possible for more families to homeschool, which in the long run will gain more support for homeschooling. Our neighbors have seen how successful homeschooling has been for our family, and now they are going to try homeschooling as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="585">There are so many opportunities for homeschoolers to socialize and not just in a public school setting! It's very obvious amongst all children in public schools as well as homeschools that some are really good at math &amp; others not so much, some love science while others love history, &amp; grammar comes naturally for those who love to read while others are bored to sleep by it. I support choices in education. They are not as likely as a typical public school parent to feel that they are stuck with whatever is offered. I would agree that the daily instruction was what I would consider homeschooling, in fact, we sometimes had curriculum choices in common. We go to school two days a week and homeschool the other three. In addition to that I can pick the classes I want to teach at home and the ones I would like covered at the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="586">He didn't thrive in the public school environment and is more suited to home instruction. There have been countless studies done on socialization and homeschooling and children who are home schooled come out fine in socialization. Many home schooled parents enroll their children in activities such as dance, musical instructions, scouting, 4-H and other extra curricula activities. Home schooled children have enrolled in their local theaters as well! This is one of many reasons why public schooling of large groups of children simply doesn't work for many, while others seem to thrive. The main problem I had with our public schools was the fact that they refused to listen to any suggestions or criticism from the parents. For my girls, there was so much work with so little understanding.</paragraph><paragraph parID="587">The beauty of homeschooling is that the family gets to decide what's best for it's own, no matter what. It seems to me that if a parent chooses to teach his/her own child in the home, that parent is homeschooling. Some of the comments have focused on the fact that charter schools or online schools create a situation where the parent has to answer to someone else and therefore is no longer homeschooling. I would argue that most parents who have agreed to these situations are aware that they have other options and, if that parent feels that another option would better serve the student or family, is likely to change. I knew many families who homeschooled using a local public charter school. The difference was that they had to get approval, turn in results and be supervised by a teacher (with varying levels of assistance provided by this extra level of interference). If the charter stopped allowing a curriculum, then they had to stop using it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="588">They had to come to teacher meetings, even if it interfered with their day an provided little support. For example, way back in time learning was personalized and the children exceeded greatly. Today, barely being mediocre seems to be the new standard for masses of institutionalized students who are in group instructions for hours on end. If we blend today's advanced technology with the kids' right to excel on an individual basis thru home education in any of its various forms, then these students can take their knowledge and skills and create a better tomorrow for their generation &amp; future families. Isn't one of the reasons we homeschool to avoid labels? I enjoy the freedom to create our own curriculum &amp; teach the way that fits our children best...others should have that same freedom without criticism or being made to feel left out of the home education community...whatever method they choose! It's CHOICE that is the foundation of home schooling, not the books, methods or curriculum used.</paragraph><paragraph parID="589">We use a state accredited curriculum from a university. I supplement it with my own curriculum. We know our kids and can tailor their educations accordingly. You know there are "bad" homeschooling/unschooling parents that makes it harder for the rest of us. There are "bad" parents in every type of school system. I choose the curricula my daughter thrives in, and we do it our own way. We use textbooks for christian schools, workbooks, unit studies, and a classical reading list.</paragraph><paragraph parID="590">Arguments aside about whether socializing between equal age children is necessary for a healthy childhood, homeschooling proponents claim that in today's modern age of easy communication and travel, that socializing while home educating is a non-issue.... "Credentialism has existed for centuries in one form or another as groups with an information or knowledge advantage have tried to maintain their position of superiority with everything from guilds and associations to secret societies and esoteric languages. And even though teachers and educators have noble intentions, their position in our economy, by design is dependent upon a psychology of the scarcity of knowledge." Her family chose homeschooling for the freedom it afforded them -- freedom from the school schedule and calendar; freedom to follow her children's interests; freedom from labeling and categorizing her children; and freedom from testing and homework. I liked school and from that viewpoint, I feel as if I'm denying my children the fun of class parties and plays... Marjorie has been homeschooling her two young daughters for just a few years. We've all heard it before -- "but what about socialization?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="591">It may be one of most people's first concerns as they consider homeschooling, whether trying to decide for themselves or when hearing of others who are homeschooling.... Yet sometimes I mourn the path not taken, the well-worn, often unquestioned path of traditional school. Homeschooling is one of the options that savvy parents are considering these days, when planning for the education of their children. Parents that work at home are often homeschoolers, too, as these two activities dove-tail quite nicely for entrepreneurial families. There are many ways to home educate; I feel that even a family using a pre-packaged curriculum is going to add their own touches to the program, simply because family life-style and circumstances will make it impossible for them to do otherwise. Thus, as you consider that each family is unique, so, too, will their homeschool program need to be.... Quite often when children experience difficulties in school, it's because of a bad fit.</paragraph><paragraph parID="592">I called it the "square peg in a round hole" syndrome. If your child has a unique learning style, or learning differences, it's easy for him or her to fall behind if left in a typical classroom setting. Even kids with some identified learning disabilities have been found to thrive in a homeschooling environment.... Homeschooling is sometimes a difficult choice for families to make, especially if they have always been dependent on two incomes to make ends meet. For us, the choice to homeschool came after several years on one income, followed by two years when I worked part-time, banking my earnings to finance the adoption of our fourth child. I read with great interest stories of homeschooled or self-taught people, trying to find clues that would help me guide my children in a way that would result in them becoming self-directed. A few years into homeschooling my children, my focus changed from trying to develop curriculum that fit each child, to how I could develop life-long learners....</paragraph><paragraph parID="593">We began to homeschool with the idea that we would provide an educational environment and learning experience that would help our son, who was having difficulties in the institutional school setting. Through independent testing we were learning that he was an auditory learner with distractibility issues. Thus his learning needs were not being totally met in the public school.... I chose to listen to the uncomfortable and uneasy feelings in my heart and mind that emerged from that brief hour and look into other ideas on how to continue the path of holistic living and learning that we had been implementing based on our Christian beliefs since the day he was born. Eli also knows he has a tender heart which means he is highly sensitive and that he is very creative which means he is a strong right-brained learner.... "She's smart, but lazy." "He's living below his potential."</paragraph><paragraph parID="594">These are some of the comments a parent of a right-brained learner may hear about their child in regard to their learning process. This creative learner is often later in developing the areas of reading, math computation, spelling, handwriting, and writing. But, there are reasons for this timing in the development of these areas based on their strengths and how they learn and process information. And there are reasons we subconsciously place judgments upon these children and how they learn.... Alex, my fifth child and fourth son, was diagnosed with autism in February, 1997, at just over two years old. At twelve years old today, he would probably be considered high functioning autism. Although it is said that a person with autism has an "encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus", I have found that with a little shaping through expansion, it can also be a catalyst for engagement in a full life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="595">One of Alex's long-standing interests is ceiling fans, and I would like to share some glimpses into how this interest has enhanced his life.... I ended my last post about my oldest son, Eric's, first experience with formal education through a dual-enrollment community college program. He had taken two courses with very different instructors and expectations for what made up his end grade. Eric had brought his unschooling perspective into the classroom with him and did well with a professor whose grading recognized and reflected the real learning that occurred within the confines of my son's mind.... My oldest son, Eric, 16 at the time, wanted to learn to computer program for a possible interest in pursuing video game programming. Naturally, he wanted to learn the programming language that real video games are programmed in, C++, and so our hunt for resources began.... My children are growing up just fine and learning all the time ...</paragraph><paragraph parID="596">While the public schools are preparing children for NCLB testing by teaching to pre-determined learning objectives and benchmarking progress at pre-set intervals with carefully calculated pacing guides (did I get that right?) , we are.....not.... When we first took the leap into homeschooling, our thoughts were a jumble. We were so terrified. What if we failed? What if people didn't approve? What would people think of us?</paragraph><paragraph parID="597">We were Liberal Democrats who always supported public education. What would our friends think? I went online to find answers.... I came to homeschooling reluctantly when my eldest son dragged me to it. I was an uber-school mom: Vice President of the PTO, room-mother, school board activist. This piece originally appeared on Shay's homeschool blog, called " Anecdotal Evidence ." New homeschoolers understandably worry about meeting state requirements and interacting with division superintendents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="598">I find that the longer I homeschool, the more paradigm shifts I have. Part of what drew me to homeschooling was the freedom to let my kids learn at a pace that made sense to them. One of the more common arguments against homeschooling is that it "isolates" kids. That somehow kids, if not in school, will never be exposed to the world at large. That homeschoolers sit at home all day with no interaction with anyone outside their family.... Some people had good arguments about the benefits of having kids learn things that they may or may not be interested in and others made the argument that kids, if given a wealth of exposure, will learn what they need to know.... On it, an atmospheric scientist talks about how worried she is because the curriculum used in many schools in Washington state has gotten away from teaching the traditional math algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</paragraph><paragraph parID="599">One of the issues she brought up was the fear that she might be "babying" her kids and that school is necessary for kids to be able to manage in the "real world" (where else will they be able to learn how to deal with those "hard knocks"?) The larger schools tend to follow the public schools in their testing and grading habits, but many more experimental schools or home-based schools do not use customary testing or grading at all, but rely instead on close, personal evaluation of the children. Parents in California may legally educate their children themselves, or "homeschool", using a number of different choices. They can use public independent study or charter school programs, home-based or campus based private schools (including schools just for that family's children), or tutor their children, if they have a credential. All school age children must attend school or they are truant. The California Education Code states: "[A]ll children between the ages of 6 and 18 must attend a public full-time day school unless otherwise exempted." Homeschooling families in California comply with the compulsory attendance law in one of several ways: (a) home-based private schools that comply with the statutory requirements (&#167;48222 exemption); private school satellite programs for homeschoolers (&#167;48222 exemption); using a private tutor (&#167;48224 exemption); using a public school independent study (public school); or using a public charter school independent study, distance learning, or homeschool program (public school).</paragraph><paragraph parID="600">Children are exempt from compulsory attendance if they "are being instructed in a private full-time day school by persons capable of teaching." This broad definition includes home-based private schools as well as private school cooperatives and private school satellite programs. Home-based private schools are required to keep the following records: (a) attendance records (&#167;48222); courses of study offered (&#167;33190); faculty qualifications (&#167;33190); criminal record summaries (&#167;&#167;33190 and 44237); Immunization records or waivers (Health and Safety Code &#167;120335.) A government official, such as an attendance officer, is legally entitled to see a copy of the filed private school affidavit, the attendance records, and a letter verifying that the children are enrolled in and attending the school. Although private schools are required to keep the other records in the above list, no public official is entitled to see them without a subpoena. Homeschoolers often do keep work samples or summaries of work. Families operating private schools should keep records to confirm work completed to prepare transcripts for transfer to another school or college applications.</paragraph><paragraph parID="601">A student who is out in public during times when public school students are normally inside a school building is not necessarily doing anything inappropriate, and is certainly not doing anything illegal (unless the community has a daytime curfew ordinance). California law requires that instruction in private schools be in English and "in the several branches of study required to be taught in the public schools" (&#167;48222). Although instruction must be offered in those areas by the school, it is not necessary to offer them in the same years, or in the same sequence, as the public school, except as specifically noted in the statute. Many private schools attempt to duplicate as closely as possible what is taught in the public schools, and use the same textbooks and materials, but this is not required. While some parents use a "boxed" curriculum available from any number of vendors, many parents use a wide variety of materials, not just conventional educational materials but also literature, practical experience, and materials available over the internet. Some parents also follow a philosophy known as "unschooling", in which the children are permitted to take on learning tasks as they naturally become ready and interested. While the parents are watching closely to see that material in all fields of learning is available and to facilitate learning whenever possible, they do not require the children to engage in particular activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="602">Some states require that homeschooling parents have a high school diploma or college degree; California has not adopted legislation about who may teach in private schools. Parents operating private schools to educate only their own children are not required to obtain city business licenses. Private out-of-state PSPs, while useful for curricular support, only satisfy the legal requirements for public school exemption if the school has filed its own affidavit in California and complies with all other legal requirements for a private school in this state. Some charter schools offer students the opportunity to compete on public school sports teams, while others are only distance learning programs using the Internet. There are many families who don't realize other educational  alternatives are possible. The recent issues in Wisconsin concerning the public education system have made me realize how much we, as an entire society of Americans, worship the institute of public school. The mentality held by the average American is jumping through the hoops of public school is vital to achieve success later in life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="603">By age five or six, we have already been taught the system is the only choice we have, it is the golden standard by which we must all measure up, it is the river we are all demanded to travel on, and anyone who dares to do or suggest otherwise is automatically labeled as an incompetent imbecile. Recall the great intellectuals you have learned about in school; many if not most of them were considered failures of the system in their day, yet went on to achieve great things, their names destined to be written in the textbooks used by the very institution they rejected. Thomas Edison was openly considered a failure during the early years of his life, Albert Einstein's parents were told by his teachers he had a learning disability, and former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and New York Times' bestselling author Christopher Paloni were both homeschooled. Don't be pigeonholed into the box, you have the right to choose for yourself. I am not against the existence of public schools; many people enjoy high school and go on to do well in life. I am here to say you have other options and there is nothing wrong with exploring them. A few years back, a local acquaintance was asking me about my kids' educational plans after a soccer game.</paragraph><paragraph parID="604">Her dad was one of my former teachers and she was also employed with the school. I could tell she was biting her tongue regarding our decision to homeschool. over the years. She addressed my decision  with this comment:  "I believe in the public school system". Knowing she was a devout Christian, I responded that I hadn't thought of it as a religion, so I just learned something from her that day. It was a short conversation. That reminds me of another conversation with a soccer dad who told us we needed to put our boys in the school because they needed as many soccer players as they could get.</paragraph><paragraph parID="605">He wasn't joking. When Pat was on the school board, there were a couple of those fellas standing in the back with crossed arms during the school board meetings making sure sports received all necessities and otherwise in the budget. They were the sports bodyguards. But then again, some of my most enlightening conversations about education have been around the soccer field. Who'd have known? But speaking of extra-curricular activities, or what many families would consider part of their vital learning experiences, the LA Times interviewed a 12 year old actor performing in one of my family's favorite theatrical endeavors: Les Mis&#233;rables. Colin DePaula, 12, plays Parisian gamin Gavroche in "Les Mis&#233;rables" at the Ahmanson while Judy Durkin, 11, gender bends to become the doomed Duke of York in "Richard III" at Theatricum Botanicum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="606">Here, the prince and the pauper talk showbiz. Give us the basics. Colin: I was born in L.A. but moved to New York when I was 3. I live in Brooklyn. L.A. is my 16th city on this tour. I'm home schooled - my mom travels with me. Regular school versus home schooling: discuss.</paragraph><paragraph parID="607">Colin: Home schooling's way better because you don't have to sit in one room all day. Definitely a benefit and Colin is having one great traveling adventure. What a wonderful learning experience. Our boys are playing cello, violin/fiddle, mandolin, banjo, harmonica along with an accordion springing into the picture too. We would not have taken advantage of those amazing musical opportunities if not for homeschooling. We had the time. Last story - Delaware native 16 year old Nick Ferrell and family made a big decision last year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="608">After his performance at last year's national championship, in which he was riding in the top five for several laps before his engine blew up, he moved to a full-time training facility in Cairo, Ga. For him, a typical day of training includes a morning stretch, about four hours of training on the track, cardio, bike maintenance and home-schooling. Before he moved to Georgia, Ferrell, who is from Townsend, was enrolled at St. Georges Technical High School. His father, Tim, called the decision to send him to Millsaps Training Facility "the hardest decision of our life." But Nick Ferrell knew it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. "It wasn't a tough decision for me," he said. "I was all into it."</paragraph><paragraph parID="609">Seems like someone who is voluntarily out in "more than 100-degree heat, a rough track and his bike [and body] taking a pounding" has a racing bug that won't go away. Glad he can follow his passion full-time. I like to see what homeschoolers are doing with their educational alternative. Living and learning can be a lot of fun. I know I enjoy it as it seems to be addictive. Not a bad habit to have. About Susan</paragraph><paragraph parID="610">We have 6 kids in our little clan. The family farm is our headquarters surrounded by corn, soybeans and all of God's little creatures. We've tried out various forms of education for our kids and homeschooling fits like a glove. That's the life for us even as the kids venture out doing this or that with other education methods. We are very grateful to live in Illinois as it is a wonderful state to homeschool in freedom. The plan is to keep it that way. They feel that because they are teaching their children and with them every day, they are well aware of their children's progress and know what their children's strengths and weaknesses are.</paragraph><paragraph parID="611">Many also believe that the very process of taking a standardized test is objectionable. Children in public school programs, including charter schools, may or may not be required to take the usual state standardized tests as a condition of enrolling in the program. Programs that receive or are affiliated with districts that receive federal funding are under increased pressure to require that all students test. Although parents in California do have the guaranteed option under state law of excusing their children from standardized tests, programs are finding that they have to condition enrollment on agreeing to test, which is negatively impacting enrollment in the public programs. State law does not require that children in private schools take any standardized tests. The legislature chose to let parents determine whether their children are being educated satisfactorily. Of course, many private schools offer or require some form of testing, mostly because the parents expect it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="612">Families that operate their own private schools and wish to test do have the ability to locate testing services that will test their children. Because California law has no "accountability" rules for any of its private schools, large or small, there will not necessarily be any customary "proof" of student achievement from these schools. Special Situations A. Withdrawing A Child from Public or Private School Mid-Year Parents have the absolute right to withdraw their child from public school and use any other legal option to educate their child. Some children receive special services under an IEP; the IEP may have requirements that parents and children follow certain agreed procedures, but the parents may withdraw their children and find the services their children need independently. B. Homeschooling after a Divorce</paragraph><paragraph parID="613">Although it is legal to homeschool after a divorce or in a situation where the other parent does not agree with homeschooling, the ultimate decision as to whether a parent can homeschool may be up to the Family Law Court. The judge will make a decision based upon the evidence presented at the court hearing regarding what is in the child's best interest. As homeschooling grows in popularity, we find that attorneys and judges are more willing to learn about its benefits and consider it when making educational decisions. First, the parent who wants to homeschool and any legal representatives should try to educate the other parent about the benefits of homeschooling. Usually the benefits are both to the child and to the child's relationship with that parent. If that is not possible, then the parent who wants to homeschool should decide whether homeschooling is worth the battle with the other parent. The parent needs to consider whether homeschooling over the other parent's objection is in the child's best interest.</paragraph><paragraph parID="614">Second, in order to prevail on the homeschooling issue in a custody case, accountability must be documented. Unlike most homeschooling situations, the homeschooling parent must be prepared to document the academic learning and social development of the child. This documentation can be done in several ways: (1) enrollment in a public or private homeschooling program where educators other than the parent document the child's progress; (2) enrollment in a public charter school; (3) hire an independent tutor; (3) consult with a professional educational consultant who will write progress reports; or (4) use independent testing sources. While these suggestions can help document the child's school progress, there is no guarantee that a court will accept it or allow a parent to homeschool. When a court gets involved in the homeschool decision, its responsibility is to do what it believes to be in the best interest of the child based on the evidence and its information about homeschooling. The court wants to make the right decision, and needs to be given enough information to help it. It must be given evidence about the specific homeschooling situation and reliable homeschooling information, in as concise a form as possible.</paragraph><paragraph parID="615">By providing this information, the court has the best chance to reach the right decision for the child. C. Truancy Investigations The compulsory attendance laws are enforced by attendance officers, usually at the district level, and sometimes by the county office of education. If the child is in a public program, the parent should give them the administrator's name. The attendance officer needs to contact the school administrator for other information. If the parent operates a private school, then the officer is entitled to verify that the child is attending the private school and that the "private school has complied with the provisions of &#167;33190 requiring the annual filing by the owner or other head of a private school of an affidavit or statement of prescribed information with the Superintendent of Public Instruction." The officer or a social worker has no authority to obtain additional information or records.</paragraph><paragraph parID="616">D. Children's Protective Services Educational neglect alone cannot be a basis for an investigation and police officers and CPS workers cannot enter a home without a warrant or a reasonable belief that the child is in imminent danger of physical harm. Psychological harm is not enough. E. Welfare Benefits Welfare benefits cannot be denied just because a family is homeschooling their children as long as they are using one of the legal options. It should be enough for the homeschool family to provide a verification of enrollment and attendance in school to the child support agency,together with a copy of the private school affidavit if the family operates its own school.

Now don't throw stones dear friends who are more traditional. When you reach that point you realise you are going to homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="618">Many of us tried (myself included) to reproduce the school atmosphere and teaching methods at home. There really is no need or value in doing that. First let's look at the timing of school. School runs from September through June. Schools tend to be 5 days a week up to 8 hours a day. Homeschooling allows you a great deal of variety in this area. You set your homeschooling year, even if your state requires 180 days of instruction.</paragraph><paragraph parID="619">You can and should mark every day homeschooling, field trips, meetings, etc into a log to meet your requirements. That means that you can start your year on August first taking a long Christmas break off. Or school year round with larger breaks through the year. You decide what fits your family that best.Let's look at the hours per day homeschooling. One on one teaching or even with your family is much more efficient than a large classroom. You will finish teaching a subject in less than 15 minutes usually. The work time may be longer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="620">I don't give homework regularly. We do our work right there and finish multi subjects with multiple kids at lunch. The rest of the day and weekend is life time. Second the physical structure of the school room versus home. I won't argue kids need a solid surface to work with their material. They need a solid, comfortable chair to sit at. Your dining room table will suffice for most of that.</paragraph><paragraph parID="621">Have a set place for your child's work and material like pencils, crayons etc. We had separate desks for the kids at one point, remember I started out with the copy the school idea. Just like in school they became a place to hid things they knew they couldn't have during learning time, like candy and also a mess! The desks are now my end tables. Third the subjects and the time frame the public school gives for learning material. I am aware of the material that a child my child's age would be learning. I use this as a loose guide to where we might have some weaknesses or a need to cover a certain topic.</paragraph><paragraph parID="622">I do not teach as per the state school objectives. I think they are pale and unexciting. I do have a learning structure to our year but I am not constrained by it. Homeschooling allows us to follow rabbit trails. One year a friend was cleaning out her shelves and gave us an electricity experiment book and package. The kids stopped everything and we worked with that electricity project for over a week. We even got dad in on it showing us how homes were wired and what a series circuit was.</paragraph><paragraph parID="623">Also the time frame for reading, math skills, writing skills etc. is based on an average student, and the needs of a state to push their educational goals. This means it has little to do with your child. If your son doesn't understand reading in First grade, or Second but he is making progress towards that goal he is still within age norms, but the school would consider this behind. It may take some time and few months actually homeschooling to get your groove. Stay open to non-traditional ways of learning. Creating an atmosphere in your home that is enriched and comfortable. Homeschool is not a strain on my family rather it has become a foundational piece of why we are so strong.</paragraph><paragraph parID="624">I hope you enjoy your journey! I have a daughter who is learning impaired. She is 18 but mentally about 8. I would really like to know if there is any help out there to home school my daughter. She has one year left of school and if I can teach her at home I would love to do that. Regular school isn't teaching her 1/2 of what she needs to know. Cindy welcome!</paragraph><paragraph parID="625">There is a wide range of material available to teach your daughter. I often encourage teaching to their ability and work your way up.

Each blog does, however, in some small way represent one life, one family, once voice, one lifestyle out of many who choose to live life without school. How are you sure your children are learning enough; what about holes in your child's education? Nothing like dancing with your language lessons, and knowing at least how to say "please" and "thank you" everywhere you go.</paragraph><paragraph parID="627">It's on the schedule for the boys and I to make our own solar cooker . Because of him, we're watching endless rounds of nature shows on Netflix, about the finches and the lizards and Darwin. Next week, Jason is flying to Seattle to join up with our pal Toast , to sail their boat down here to San Francisco Bay. They've just finished a circumnavigation of Vancouver Island, and the boys are just bursting with questions to ask Toast's three daughters, who are friends of theirs. The boys have never been anyplace like Vancouver Island, nor have they seen orcas or humpbacks in the water next to the boat, as Toast's family has. We've already spent a bunch of time talking about Japan , but the boys hadn't really understood that we could sail there. I love real-world learning, too, kids retain so much more of what they learn when it's all placed in context.</paragraph><paragraph parID="628">You could have named this post "Socialization in the school of the world." Connecting actual people with regions of the world; connecting regions with languages, geography, and customs; and at the same time connecting with people human to human--all of this equals global socialization IMO. Sometimes the most fleeting of meetings can make a huge impact and a life-long connection. Your kids are going to have actual people connections all around the world, not just digital connections--dude, you guys are building the ultimate world-wide web! But there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. Copyright &#169; Life Without School Publications, LWOS Publications, 2006 All rights reserved. Recently, the public radio station in my area broadcast a panel discussion on homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="629">During the course of the program, the statewide homeschooling leaders present deliberately avoided making any comparative comments regarding government schools, despite repeated attempts by the host to elicit them. In listening to these exchanges, I was aghast at the missed opportunity to draw the critical distinctions between the government school system and homeschooling. Homeschooling and the government school system are based on completely opposing principles. At their core, the ideological differences represent viewpoints that can not be reconciled and are key elements of the school and culture wars being fought throughout our society today. To understand this, we need to take a closer look at the underlying premises of these two dissimilar educational models. Freedom versus coercion Homeschooling's bedrock principle is liberty.</paragraph><paragraph parID="630">Freedom for children and families to learn and teach what they want, how they want, and when they want. Freedom for parents to spend as much, or as little, of their own resources as they decide is necessary on educating their own children. Freedom for families to make their own educational choices. The government school system is founded on the opposite of liberty - various forms of compulsion, coercion, force are used to effect its mandates. Compulsory attendance laws are backed by inquisitions (Student Attendance Review Boards in California ) that have the power to take our property (fines) if we fail to comply. The system is funded by the annual seizure of our property (taxes), backed up by the threat of imprisonment and additional confiscation of property. Children failing to learn the state-required material (mandatory curriculum) can be required to sit through it year after year until they demonstrate that the material has been sufficiently implanted.</paragraph><paragraph parID="631">This method of "compulsory education" meets my dictionary's definition of brainwashing. Whether the material "taught" is based on liberal, conservative, religious, communistic, democratic, or fascist ideologies, the government school system method of delivery is founded on compulsion, coercion, force. The dichotomy between homeschooling and government schooling is the difference between a moral and an immoral system. Homeschooling respects the rights of individual families to choose for themselves, while government schooling imposes its ideology on all children through predatory financing and its monopoly of force. Jefferson eloquently described the immorality of our current system when he said: "To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical." Self-perpetuating, self-defending Keep in mind that there is a distinction between the government school system and the people working in it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="632">Many of them are motivated by the best of intentions and, on a local level, are able to achieve some modest, positive results. However, their intentions do not invalidate the immorality of the system. More importantly, the system defends itself by corrupting those who seek to work within it. Faced with the noble goal of "educating our children," many will sacrifice their principles - either unknowingly or by rationalizing that "the ends justify the means." They choose to force all parents to submit their children to the government school system in order to "help" those few children who might have neglectful parents. Economically, people who depend on the system for their livelihood, as individuals looking out for their own best interest, will defend it from attacks and endeavor to increase its scope, power, and budget. To illustrate this, we need look no further than teachers who lecture their captive audience of students on the evils of vouchers, or the California Department of Education's opposition to homeschooling, or the National Education Association's continual political battles to wrest more money from taxpayers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="633">By contrast, homeschooling, based on individual and family liberty, protects children from having the values of the political majority (or active minority) imposed on them. Homeschooling also removes the economics of education from the political arena and returns it to the family. Missing the point with misguided reforms Many people both inside and outside the government school system seek to reform it. Huge political battles are fought over issues like vouchers, phonics, school prayer, curriculum content, and sex education. There are minor battles as well, over such issues as reimbursing homeschoolers in government school Independent Study Programs for educational materials. Parents and concerned citizens participating in these battles completely miss the point.</paragraph><paragraph parID="634">They are each part of a special interest group seeking to impose their views and values on the next generation through the medium of the government schools and other people's money. From a moral standpoint, it doesn't matter who wins any particular battle - the key point is that someone loses and is forced to support and subject their children to a system imposing the winner's values or beliefs. From a practical standpoint, winning a battle doesn't solve anything, it just sets the stage for the next round. There are no compromises in the school wars. Most educational reformers also fail to recognize that arguments about how taxpayer dollars should or should not be spent on various government school programs/issues serve only to validate the system itself and its use of compulsion, coercion, force. Even worse, parents fighting for their "share" of educational tax dollars risk being corrupted by the system. Other People's Money (OPM, pronounced "opium") can be highly addicting, as many organizations and individuals have discovered.</paragraph><paragraph parID="635">There is no way to reform an immoral system founded on the principles of compulsion, coercion, force. Efforts to do so contribute to legitimizing and supporting an institution antithetical to the principles on which our country was founded. The only way to "reform" such a system is to replace it with a proven, superior approach - a free market in education, exemplified by today's homeschooling families. Homeschooling provides a glimpse of the potential for a free market in education. Within the burgeoning homeschooling movement, one begins to see the true breadth and depth of educational innovation and experimentation possible. Parents spontaneously create their own educational communities to support each other and solve common educational problems. A huge variety of educational relationships result: relatives and friends assisting as teachers; professionals hired for specific subject matter needs; co-op teaching (parents trading off); blended schooling (part home, part campus-based); distance learning using new technologies; and more.</paragraph><paragraph parID="636">Replacing the current, immoral government system with a moral, free-market educational system requires the separation of school and state. As Sheldon Richman argues in the November, 1995 issue of The Freeman , we need to remove education from the democratic (or political) arena and return it to families because "democracy is inimical to education, if by 'education' we mean the family-based assisting of children to become moral, competent, and well-rounded human being." Homeschoolers are the "freedom fighters" of educational reform. As such, they need to be more vocal about the ideological differences between government schooling and homeschooling. Representatives of the government school system are continually trying to impose regulations and controls on homeschooling and have succeeded in some states, like Pennsylvania and New Hampshire . The government school system clearly recognizes the financial and ideological threats posed by homeschooling and is already counter-attacking. Keeping a low profile vis-a-vis the government schools will not help at this point.</paragraph><paragraph parID="637">Marshall Fritz describes homeschoolers as the "leading edge of the wedge" in the fight for educational freedom. By separating school and state, the creativity, innovation, and freedom glimmering in the homeschool movement would shine for children and families everywhere.

Permission is granted to freely distribute this article as long as this copyright notice is included in its entirety. There are also homeschoolers who sign up with a private school, who have varying level of independence, who we don't use the term for, but who still ultimately have complete autonomy. If something like that happened in the US, the real issue would not be fighting for HS freedoms, but maintaining our freedom as individuals.</paragraph><paragraph parID="638">What is homeschooling: A Comparitive Between Past and Present I've been musing about this question since coming on-line to the homeschooling world three years ago after being content with the "in real life" experiences I had always enjoyed. The on-line world of home/unschooling was SO different than my real life experiences. I also saw a considerable shift in the past ten years in real life as well. I'm on a couple e-mail lists that are involved with a similar discussion: politics and homeschooling . . . where are we going? I've not been heavily involved in the politics of homeschooling, but always very interested and supportive in my place to continue the freedoms we all enjoy. I have often been closely associated with those home/unschooler's whose passion and purpose it was to be a "thumb on the pulse of homeschooling politics".</paragraph><paragraph parID="639">But, it seems that I'm at a place that I could take another step toward understanding and supporting those who are concerned about protecting our freedoms in homeschooling, both now and for the future. So, I got to thinking about what has changed in homeschooling since I began, and how does that fit into the legislative and political history of homeschooling, and can it give insights as to where we are now, and where we are meant to go in furthering the cause of freedom for homeschooling. But, first, what is homeschooling to me? I chose homeschooling as an option to not be connected to the auspices of public institution . . . at all. I chose homeschooling as an option that granted me the autonomy to discover what "education" was for me and my family and each individual child. I chose homeschooling because of the myriad of resources that I would be able to utilize that was available in the greater world. I chose homeschooling to open up possibilities for more . . . more than the stilted environment, programs, dynamics, and watered-down, systematic spoon-feeding that existed in government institutions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="640">I had very proactive reasons for choosing homeschooling for our lifestyle of learning. The first five years of home/unschooling obviously became my measuring stick of what I thought homeschooling was not just to me, but for many others. I felt a great cameraderie of working together and sharing resources and gifts with one another as we respected each of our differences that simply added fodder for great homeschooling discussions. The past ten years, I've felt as if I have been floating in a time warp, continually looking for what I once had, but thinking it was simply my location, or my family logistics, which it might be, but now wondering if it is more than that. Several experiences have been accumulating that have served as a catalyst for my inner activist to emerge with some definitive thoughts and ideas. It's the difference between believing in the system but wanting more choices versus not believing in the system and wanting to carve out another way. Oh, there was someone called a "coordinator", but that wasn't about making decisions for the group, but simply, well, coordinating everyone and what they wanted and how they would contribute.</paragraph><paragraph parID="641">During our monthly meetings, there was certainly a main focus of encouraging everyone to contribute in some way in providing a resource that could be offered to others. As is usual in our human society, it still often fell on the 20% to manage 80% of what happened, but such it was, and camaraderie prevailed as friendships and respectful interactions were the norm. I chose homeschooling as the path that granted me freedom to make our own choices on a path less traveled. There really was no leader! In the day I began homeschooling, so many stood on the ideal of freedoms and personal choice, so it makes sense that our inclusive groups would operate in order to have that expression realized. Each voice was equal and together we worked things out for all to get their needs met. In the leadership paradigm, there seems to be more of a democratic process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="642">Not that it is bad since our country is founded on that type of government, but then again, protection of the masses is important in that dichotomy. I had chosen homeschooling for individualistic reasons; to be the author of my own path. I definitely felt like "one of the masses" being spoken TO when part of the democratic support groups. A resource that supports and empowers their freedom of personal choice through working together to create a resource that can work to meet some of their needs? Or a resource that helps them belong to a group that believes in what they do and will help them get what they want and feel "taken care of"? There's a shift in focus between the two . . . Am I saying that one is good and one is bad? Believing in the System but Wanting More Choices vs. Not Believing in the System and Wanting to Carve Out Another Way Now, here's my biggee that I've been working through, and maybe putting a voice to it in this manner might help clarify some things for me.</paragraph><paragraph parID="643">The children "ate it up" and continued to love to learn and find joy in the process. Ours is a world of experts, specialization, labels, and the over-achiever mentality. Because of the proliferation of choice, the explosion of growth within homeschooling circles may be because so many can hang onto the expert umbrella through things like e-schools and other public school hybrids where they can "be taken care of", but have a different choice of environment. Another segment of people are coming to homeschooling with a myriad of school-created labels attached to their children who are floundering in the system. The parents recognize that the environment in which their children were being educated doesn't work for them, so they are seeking other choices under the same paradigm that might work better. These labels become evidence that another choice is needed, so they seek out experts who can help "take care of them" as they work tirelessly to help their child under that expert. Or, there are parents who feel they can do a better job than schools and want to see their child excel (ala over-achiever mentality) and seek out all the best curricula and systems available as another choice "to take care of them" in order to meet the needs of their gifted children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="644">The homeschooler of the past left behind the mentality, the perspective, and the clutches of public institutional thinking, processes, procedures, perspectives and mentalities in belief that there was a more holistic way of viewing learning, particularly outside the confines of an inflexible entity. I believe many of today's homeschooler's actually believe in the system, but want more choices within that realm in order to be "taken care of" in a different way because of labels, over-achiever needs, and/or need for specialization. It appears that parents of today are partnering their intelligence and energies with the experts and systems available to create another option for an individualized, but pre-packaged education about which they can get excited about following. Myself and other homeschoolers I started with were using their intelligence and energies to map out their own path to what learning is at a more holistic level that will look different child to child, stage to stage, situation to situation. Again, am I saying one is better than another? No. So many today are looking for alternative choices to the public school settting, but has an aspect of being taken care of under another system of learning and resources.</paragraph><paragraph parID="645">They rely on experts and support groups and curriculum producers and other homeschooling systems (like HSLDA) created to do just that. One of the things that has changed is an increasing culture of "accountability" in government which, in education, is leading to more detailed curriculum guidelines from the government and compulsory standardized testing as a way of measuring how schools are doing. I think this has also led to interesting policies for dealing with homeschooling that affect how individual parents approach what they do. Also, some folks who homeschool believe that there is a "one right way" or set of universal goals and thus have gone for a political strategy of suggesting that they be judged by the same standards. Homeschool Fact: Home-schooled children of parents who do not have a college education outperform public education. Even in homes in which neither parent has a degree, students tested at 83% nationally. That's 33% above the national average.</paragraph><paragraph parID="646">Homeschooling Grows in the Black Community Written by Mike Smith Most importantly, the black homeschool movement is growing at a faster rate than the general homeschool population. The results: 35.2 percent of blacks viewed public education as excellent/good while 53.7 percent of the general population viewed public education as excellent/good. Of the black population surveyed, 25.4 percent said public education was poor, versus 14.3 percent of the general population. Homeschooling for black families is not a new idea; it's an old idea revisited. Successful homeschooling requires time, effort, and commitment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="647">The changing attitudes of minorities indicate that public educators can't count indefinitely on the loyalty of ethnic minorities as the backbone of big city schools. Mike Smith is the president of Home School Legal Defense Association. Mike and his wife Elizabeth homeschooled their children for 15 years. (They are now all grown!) In addition to his duties at HSLDA, Mike and Elizabeth speak at homeschooling conventions across these United States. Public- or Home-School? I grew up an inclusionist-surrounded by, and accepting of, people with special needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="648">That is, it looks good on a piece of paper but what is actually being delivered is still segregation at heart and in practice. Pushing inclusion in my school district is fast becoming a primary focus for my advocacy efforts-right behind making sure my children are receiving their fair and public and INCLUDED education... in the least restrictive environment with appropriate supports to ensure their academic progress. The dilemma: If I pull My Boys out of the public school system because it is not meeting their needs, not educating them, not providing appropriate support to ensure their academic success, not, not, not... then am I effectively quitting the fight for inclusion in education? But for most typically-developing kids, exposure to disability (unless it's present in their immediate family) and the natural inclusion of people with special needs predominantly starts at school. A study done in England showed that the segregation mindset-the notion that people with special needs should be kept separate from the general population-is already evident by the time children are in first grade. That's the Question! I've got mixed feelings about this... See, I've always been a proponent of the public school system... right up until I had kids and realized that my distaste for the Bell Curve method applied to pretty much anything detracts from individualized instruction and separates the outliers from the typical.</paragraph><paragraph parID="649">School is generally the first time children are introduced to attitudes other than their family's. So, exposure to and inclusion of children with special needs in the education system, right from the start, is critical to changing the mindset of future generations. If I pull My Boys and the Old Soul out to home-school them, I am segregating them from the general population. If we all choose to home-school our children with special needs-versus push the public schools to make inclusion work as a best practice proven out in the research and supported by the laws-then aren't we supporting the notion that our children with special needs are best educated separately? And if, in theory, the school district is not doing as good a job as I could at home, should I keep them home to do a better job myself? I see pros and cons to each solution. I guess the answer, if there is just ONE (and there isn't just ONE) is to do whatever you feel is best for your child at the time you're making the decision... and then change your mind and the arrangements when it warrants change... all to the benefit of your child, first, other children with special needs, second and society at large, third!</paragraph><paragraph parID="650">Don't homeschool your children. Enroll them in public school, and then volunteer as an aide for a few hours a day (which is time you would have spent teaching them, anyway) at your childrens' school. I know many people are fans of homeschooling, and I don't mean to step on any toes, but I don't think that the quality of socialization is the same,even if they are included in playgroups or gatherings at homes of other homeschooling families. There's a shared cultural component to public school that is difficult to quantify; in some cases, it's shared misery, a set routine and discipline, small lessons in sharing, waiting one's turn, and exercising self-control in interactions with the teacher, in others, it's the fun of a field trip or the devilish amusement caused by a misbehaving classmate. You just don't get the same group dynamics in a home school setting and you don't get the diversity, either. In general, I am against homeschooling simply because "public schools are no good" (as my ex-BIL did and then let his kids homeschool themselve via computer, long story). I have a friend whose son with autism goes to school in the morning when he is fresh and (mostly) rested.</paragraph><paragraph parID="651">He is able (for the most part) to spend the entire morning with the class, successfully learning. Then she takes him home in the afternoon when the classroom situation has become too much for him (mainly sensory and ADHD type issues). She continues with the teaching at home (using the classroom work). We each have to make the best decisions for our kids first, then our families, then the rest of the world. I just don't think I can make homeschooling work full-time - for my kids or me. I think homeschooling really is valuable for some kids and some families, but I agree that changing the overall system is going to mean parents have to get very involved and keep things moving the right direction. My kids also don't WANT to do academics with me.</paragraph><paragraph parID="652">They'll sit for the teacher in a class full of kids that are sitting... but at home, NOT A CHANCE. Well, you already know where I am. I did go and visit our school system sat and observed not just once but a couple times and even the locations that they were offering. Even had an evaluation at the states school for the blind, that asked me to look at the other location our school system offered. My son would have sat in the corner bitting his hands. He would have been lost. I'm not saying it's the right decision for you, I'm not saying it's the wrong decision for you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="653">You and your family have to decide what is right for you. Our school system seperated the special needs kids and typical peers not just by rooms, but by floors, lunchrooms, playgrounds and transportation. That was my option. That he would not get to be around typical peers ever. We are rarely home. As far as social, my son is very social. He can't communicate with others verbally, but by placing him in school he wouldn't have either.</paragraph><paragraph parID="654">He doesn't just sit in his wheelchair and chew on his hands. He's more active at home than he would have been at school. My daughter is only 2 and I have pretty much already decided to homeschool her. Don't get me wrong I have six children four which attend public school and I used to volunteer as well. But from what I have seen my friends go through recently with their special children scares me enough to not even consider exposing my child to that. It's hard enough for her to learn as it is and I don't want to waist any valuable time batteling with the school system. In our case, my school district has at least started on the road to inclusion... a few more really hard shoves and I hope we'll have them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="655">I might be that loud-mouth, law- and research-quoting shove with my two kids that gets them a little further down the road. (Not to mention I question my ability to most-effectively teach My Boys and their willingness to learn from me. I have seen them learn BEST from watching their peers interacting with teachers. In that situation, they do stuff they'd NEVER be willing to do for just me because their friends are doing it.) I wonder all the time if I am making the right decision in homeschooling my 9 year old daughter Chloe who has Down Syndrome. However, because I was a committed homeschooling mom to my "typical" son Ian, I wondered how I could send her off to school and not him, how I could justify that, even though I believe strongly in inclusion. I don't use the public school system for my 12 year old son, should I do it for my daughter?</paragraph><paragraph parID="656">So far the answer has been "No". Because you are WAY better socialized in most homeschools, and get a great deal of inclusion, much more than in public school, where you are herded into groups by age. We homeschool because public school is not a good place for our kids to get their needs met or is a bad influence. Your kids are not getting the best education for their needs, and you could do better at home. If we do, home school will make a move easy as far as changing schools goes, because we'll be taking school with us. And people as a rule, don't go around questioning parents who choose public school why they did THAT... (although I really think it's a good question) I wish more people were of the mind set that education is PERSONAL. I wish that there were more places in the middle where parents of home schooled kids and parents of publicly schooled kids met, and made sure that EACH group of kids were getting the BEST education they could.</paragraph><paragraph parID="657">School starts in a week here... Just the other day I sent in our letter of intent to home school our middle son. Today, we enrolled our oldest son in public school. Two years ago, we home schooled that son. I notice that when making choices such as homeschooling or not homeschooling, there are usually two sides. The side that thinks Home School is the ONLY answer. The side that thinks Public School is the ONLY answer. There aren't a lot of opinions near the middle, and even within those sides, there is division about what MAKES a good home school curriculum, and what makes a public school a good one.</paragraph><paragraph parID="658">I often find myself feeling caught somewhere in the middle. For one reason, I myself was home schooled. I was taught at home until I was in 9th grade. I went to public school for 2 years, and left to finish through home school. So that's a total of 10 years I was home schooled for anyone keeping count. I have had my own children in public school for most of their lives. I had Ian home for a short time in second grade, and all of his 8th grade year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="659">Josh has been in public school since he was in Kindergarten. It bothers me that the choice to home school or not to home school seems to be made because one is "better" or "worse" than the other. Taking on this attitude seems to lead to judgment of anyone who isn't making the same choices for their kids. There isn't much acceptance on EITHER side for the other choice once a choice has been made. Our choice to homeschool this year, is simple. I can tell you what it's NOT. It's NOT because I don't like our public elementary school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="660">In fact, the teacher Josh would have had this year is one that I would have requested. It's NOT because I think that homeschooling is the only way to go. It IS because I WANT to. I want to have my boys with me. I mean really. How could you NOT look at this face, and want to spend more time with the person inside? I want to share in the joy of learning with them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="661">I want to share the style of learning that I had as a child. I want them to feel loved. I want to explore the world with them. I want to teach them the world of art as I know it to be. We may be moving this year. I hate being asked WHY we have chosen to home school. The question is rarely asked without the inquirer sounding like I was talking about having a finger amputated for no reason.</paragraph><paragraph parID="662">Not of course, by everyone, but by folks who give me the feeling they are only asking because they assume that my reason must be founded in some dirt about our school they haven't heard. So the question usually sounds like they think I'm NUTS for choosing, or they sound interested in the DIRT that made me choose.When I say because I WANT to, they always seem to lose interest. As parents, HOW we choose to educate our children is just that. A CHOICE. A choice whose right answer is as individual to EACH CHILD as their fingerprints. That keeping one home and sending the other to school doesn't mean you love one more than the other, or that one is too hard to handle, so you ship them off for someone else to deal with... Just the same as sending your kids to public school and enjoying personal time without them while they are gone doesn't mean that you're not as good a parent. Where BOTH sides could appreciate that the other is choosing the thing that is right for THEIR child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="663">Because no child left behind shouldn't be about TEST scores... it should about each CHILD. Feeling LOVED. Feeling SECURE. INTERESTED in learning. CURIOUS to discover. and providing each child with the environment to achieve their best. Having BEEN home schooled, having home schooled my own kids in the past, and having them in public school as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="664">We'll chat about what our home school STYLE will be. We have considered the option with one of our boys. How hard is it to transition back and forth? I can't say much about homeschooling, it's not an option over here, so I'm not quite sure how it works. I do know that the schoolsystem over here is very good, as long as you stay on top of it and make sure the teachers are interested and motivated (Jen had a really nasty specimen at one point, who couldn't handle Jen's intelligence, stupid woman, still gets me upset)I just think you should do what's best for your child (I'm so glad mine has started her 2nd year at Uni and studies what she wants (psychology) no more worries for me LOL) Good luck!! Every child is an individual with different strengths and needs. It is our responsibility as a parent to recognize how to help the best characteristics in every child shine.</paragraph><paragraph parID="665">To be consistant. To support what we know is their gift. To preserve their well being. I have seen kids who have been Home Schooled then go on to public High School and do very well. I learned so much more during that time than I ever did in public school. Homeschooling doesn't provide the social distractions you get at public school (or even private school). I think it's great that you made the home school / public school decision based on your children's individual needs at the time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="666">My final decision to keep them homeschooled came when all the state testing started and the schools got graded as well. We noticed that the teachers began to teach the test to the students. I enjoyed spending time with our children and they learned things they wouldn't have learned in public school and maybe they didn't learn stuff they would have learned in regular school. All that to say: every child is unique in every way and they deserve wonderful moms like you and me who are willing to look at them individually and meet those needs. Being home schooled never stopped her from a social life, or anything else....she experienced travel, culture, art, hands-on math, history, science and so much more. Its their child to raise...but as a wife of a teacher and duaghter of a principal... I know that not all parents have the self disapline and skill to be a home school parent. I'm also curious if there are certain standards in terms of what you are teaching, which are state required or if you are provided information from the schools, which you are required to teach.</paragraph><paragraph parID="667">I went to public school for my education. I tolerated school. My children have gone to public school and been homeschooled. My daughter enjoyed both methods. My son liked the idea of homeschool but was a more difficult student initially but eventually came to prefer homeschool. My kids had good teachers. We didn't care for that method of learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="668">I wanted my kids to enjoy learning and to always want to learn. However, they are now 18 and 20 years old and happy with how things went, I asked. They are going to college and working. This is such a moving post. I can't say that I know much about Homeschooling, but living here in England, it is becoming more popular in recent years. I have a 3 1/2 year old niece who is just starting primary school next week, and although it is just for mornings, I feel that it is far too young. I have no children, but when the time comes for me to have one of my own, I'll definitely be thinking about Homeschooling!</paragraph><paragraph parID="669">This is such a beautiful and very moving post. My thoughts are with you. Hi Rachel, I loved your post and just wanted to let you know that I've done both with each of my 3 kids. My daughter, who was homeschooled all the way from K-12, is going to be graduating with honors with a degree in Journalism this May. Why did I do it with her? Just wanted to : ). My middle son (who has some struggles) homeschooled until 10th grade and then went to a wonderful international school while we were living in Belgium and would never have been able to go back to homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="670">My last guy has, up to this year, only been in french school, so we partially homeschooled for english. I just don't see "right" and "wrong" with the choice--only sometimes the motivation that leads to the choice. It seems to me that anyone who is so engaged in their kids' lives just can't really go wrong. More power to you, sister ; ). I home schooled our daughter until almost second grade, when she decided she wanted to be around other kids while learning. And believe me, I cried when I dropped her off that first, second, and third WEEK! By the time she was in fifth grade, she was begging to be home schooled again.</paragraph><paragraph parID="671">So be it!! She graduated a year earlier than she would have if she stayed in public school; with a high honors degree and a distinctive degree in fine-art from the state board of education. She had an overabundant amount of friends, was enrolled in various activities including art classes at a private art school, took music class at our local public school (and performed in many school concerts), worked part time and even got in trouble, as a teen, with her public school friends (minor, kid stuff). Did she miss out? Not at all. Did her friend's parents judge us? Maybe, because from them, and other parents we were asked the same questions, in the same manner &amp;amp; tone as you are.</paragraph><paragraph parID="672">I agree with what you said -- schooling should be about what is best for the child....not the parents, not the friends, and not the school system. What a lovely post! The homeschool issue is a touchy one (sadly!) , but this post could have been about almost anything. Like musebox said, the world would be a more beautiful place if we didn't judge...but how hard that is. I'm fortunate to live in a place where many homeschool but, as a parent who just chose to send one child to public school and is undecided on the next, we can have open communication with neighbors and friends on the issues. I have two kids, 3 yo and 2 yo daughters.</paragraph><paragraph parID="673">I am also thinking about homeschooling. I believed in individual and progressive learning of a child. As a stay-at-home mom, you know what your child is best at or their strengths. Different child with different learning curves and interests. Not all schools here in the Philippines can provide individual learning. Though there are some progressive schools but the tuition fees are skyrocketing! Hoping that homeschooling can provide better education for my children without losing all our money.</paragraph><paragraph parID="674">I went to Public school most of my life but for a year I was home schooled. The social advantages to Public school are good and of course some bad. Same as home schooling, I have some friends who raised 3 children with home schooling only, with very little socializing with other children or people. They all have difficulty understanding social behavior, but they are all very well behaved and intelligent. Not really the content because my sons are grown and attended public school, but rather the way you put the words together and the vibration behind them. I come from a large family and now and then my mom would homeschool one or two of the kids. I used to think I would homeschool my kids, but as my daughter's personality developed I knew learning from me was not going to work to well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="675">The only answer I could get was "We will read the questions on the FCAT (our state's standerzied testing that grades and PAYS the school) to him." I was appalled and brought all 3 of my children home to homeschool. During the 2 years of homeschooling, he brought up his reading level 3 years and when returned to public school he was only 1 year behind and I had him held back so that he would be able to accelerate. When the oldest went to 9th grade after being home for 2 years, he stated "That was the best thing you could have ever done for me." When my 4th child was ready for school, I begin trying to teach her phonics and it was a distaster. I wanted to be there with her when the light bulb went on and she learned something new. However, I think public school is the best for her.</paragraph><paragraph parID="676">Now that my 5th child is in school ... wow it is so nice to have a few hours of total silence after having children in the home for 18 years!!!! I'm deffiantly leaving the Middle School years open as homeschooling years. I sent both my kids off to public school for the first time this week and part of me wishes I was homeschooling them because I am going to miss them dearly. All my brothers and I were homeschooled, public schooled, and private schooled at some time in our lives. Besides, it is (or should be) totally up to parents on how to educate their own children (with some guidelines, of course). Also, it depends on the child (and the school district,lol.) I have homeschooled my son for 3 years and this is his first year ( 3rd grade) in public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="677">I think both can be wonderful choices if the parents decide to play an active role in their children's education.</paragraph></documents>
