  <paragraph parID="0">In the 2003 NHES, parents were asked whether particular reasons for homeschooling their children applied to them. Parents were then asked which one of those applicable reasons was their most important reason for homeschooling. Thirty-one percent of homeschoolers had parents who said the most important reason for homeschooling was concern about the environment of other schools ( figure 2 ). Thirty percent said the most important reason was to provide religious or moral instruction. The next reason was given about half as often; 16 percent of homeschooled students had parents who said dissatisfaction with the academic instruction available at other schools was their most important reason for homeschooling. From 1999 to 2003, the number of homeschooled students in the United States increased, as did the homeschooling rate. The increase in the homeschooling rate (from 1.7 percent to 2.2 percent) represents about 0.5 percent of the 2002?</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">In addition, parents? primary reasons for homeschooling their children are described. Estimates of homeschooling in 2003 are based on data from the Parent and Family Involvement in Education Survey (PFI) of the 2003 NHES. Interviews were conducted with the parents of 11,994 students (239 of whom were homeschooled). Students are considered to be homeschooled if their parents reported them as being schooled at home instead of at a public or private school for at least part of their education and if their part-time enrollment in public or private schools did not exceed 25 hours a week. Students who were schooled at home only because of a temporary illness were not included as homeschoolers. Parents?</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">Most Important Reasons for Homeschooling Their Children While data from the NHES cannot explain why homeschooling was more prevalent in 2003 than in 1999, it can provide insight into why parents homeschooled their children in 2003. 3 Parents may have homeschooled their children for a variety of reasons, but certain factors appear to have been more influential than others. Nearly two-thirds of homeschooled students had parents who said that their primary reason for homeschooling was either concern about the environment of other schools or a desire to provide religious or moral instruction. 3 Questions about reasons for homeschooling were asked differently in 1999 and 2003, and thus are not comparable. One-on-One Tutoring When it comes to homeschooling, you can't beat the student to teacher ratio.</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">It's a benefit to homeschooling for sure! Forget the crowded classrooms, even in the largest homeschool family, the student to teacher ratio is often one to one. A Customized Education What does your child struggle with? Do they have a special talent or interest? Homeschooling allows parents to customize their children's education to maximize learning, strengthen weaknesses and allow focus on special areas of interest or giftedness. More Opportunities for Character Building</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">Not only can you focus on your child's educational needs, your education encompasses their character. Building character takes time and homeschooling offers the ability to develop a well rounded child, that not only excels academically, but has moral character too. In today's society this is greatly lacking due to the high-tech, fast paced and hurried lifestyle many families live. Less Peer Pressure Children and teens today are faced with an increased level of negative influences from drugs and violence, to pressure from peers and the media. Homeschooling minimizes negative peer pressure and allows children to develop into the people God created them to be, at their own pace, in their own time. Having to face daily criticism from peers and class mates is stressful and inhibits growth and development, as well as affects learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="5">More Control Over Outside Influences Homeschooling allows parents to have more control over what their children learn, or are exposed to. Today, childhood naivety and innocence is lost as children are exposed to social issues and pressures at earlier ages through school or peers. As a homeschooling parent, you have more control over when to expose your children to certain issues as well as more time to discuss situations and reinforce your family's beliefs and values in a safe, non-threatening atmosphere. A Growing Number of Homeschool Activities Because homeschooling continues to grow, more opportunities are available for homeschooled children from enrichment classes to homeschool sports and social activities.

Seriously, homeschool students do not have as much typical "after school" homework because they can complete their assignments during class-time, with little distraction. More Flexibility Homeschooling allows you to focus more in depth on any subject or take more time to reinforce concepts to gain mastery. More Spontaneity</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">Studying forests? Take a hike through the woods. Learning about the solar system? Take an unplanned trip to the planetarium.

Curriculum that Complements Your Faith or Values Using curriculum that reinforces your faith is one of the best benefits of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="9">With the government taking faith, religion and God out of the public schools, and replacing it with humanism and evolution, it's a blessing to be able to choose curriculum that coincides with your family's values.

Reasons Why Homeschooling is Bad... Wondering if the grass is greener on the otherside of the educational fence? Consider these ten reasons why homeschooling is bad before taking the home learning leap.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">Experience learning and education as it should be! Despite the benefits to home-schooled children, some identify a significant downside to the trend. "If a large percentage of families begin to home-school, the result would be the loss of a terribly important piece of the community: the public school," says Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, in Denver. "Schools are the community glue, and when people don't feel they have a stake in the community, then things deteriorate badly," Mr. Newman adds. There are those in the home schooling community who seem to think that, in order to really reap the benefits of home educating, you must have come to the decision to homeschool for great philosophical or religious reasons. You must be coming "to" homeschooling, not running "from" the public school. Unschooling, a homeschooling method based on the belief that kids learn best when allowed to pursue their natural curiosities and interests, is practiced by 10 to 15 percent of the estimated 1.5 million homeschoolers in the United States.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">Homeschooling brings with it enormous benefits , but to get the true advantages you have to trust your children to learn in their own way. The great thing about homeschool is that it's not like school - it's infinitely better! If you're lucky, you get recognition too. That's got good sides to it - less stress, more inner fulfilment, children who wake up full of excitement and joy (most of the time, actually). So there are reasons why homeschooling is bad and why you might decide against homeschool, but if you are willing to deal with those, the benefits will make this a really special time for both you and your children. The biggest reasons why homeschooling is bad is when homeschool becomes a battleground between the teacher/parent against their pupil/child. Homeschool groups can be a lifeline.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">Homeschooled families are also very active in their local communities in a variety of ways; socialization is more than spending hours and hours in a classroom full of kids the same age. It reports on the race and ethnicity, income level, and educational attainment of students&#65533; parents; compares the characteristics of homeschoolers to those of public and private schooled students; examines how homeschooling rates have changed between 1999 and 2003 for different segments of the student population; and describes parents&#65533; primary reasons for homeschooling their children, as well as the resources and curricular tools homeschooled students use in their education. In this latest survey, parents were asked whether any of a set of reasons for homeschooling applied to them. Parents were then asked which one of the applicable reasons they considered to be their most important reason for homeschooling&#65533;31 percent of homeschooled children had parents who cited concern about the environment of other schools, such as safety, drugs, or negative peer pressure, as the most important reason for homeschooling and 30 percent had parents who said the most important reason was to provide religious or moral instruction ( table 4 ). While these were the two most common responses, another 16 percent of homeschooled students had parents who said dissatisfaction with the academic instruction available at other schools was their most important reason for homeschooling. Homeschooling rates increased from 0.9 to 1.7 percent among students with parents who have a high school diploma or less, from 2.0 to 2.7 percent among White students, from 1.6 to 2.4 percent among students in grades 6&#65533;8; and from 0.7 to 1.4 percent among students in single-parent households where the parent was in the labor force. Groups of children unfortunately tend to bring out the worst.</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">When your child is young and needs guidance most, you're there. You can deal with issues as they arise. You'll be there when the TV news comes on, friends divorce, Uncle comes out...It's real life; these are real issues in a real world. You can decide what depth to go into and what is appropriate for your child. You're not relying on teachers to take a moral lead and you're not leaving your child to work it out from the giggles of their peers. There were significant other reasons for choosing homeschooling, such as the choice of available schools and wishing to provide a non-traditional learning experience. I certainly chose homeschool because it gives you a tremendous opportunity to make learning fun, and this may be one of the reasons why researchers are proving that home school has a great academic advantage.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">Even the best school has its problems. Take smoking, alcohol, joy-riding, graffiti, playground hierarchies - they're all there (and more) wherever your child goes. If you decide to homeschool, there are a few bad things about homeschooling you'll have to face - explaining your reasons to the relatives being one of them! One of the most important to me are the benefits which come from being able to use the boundaries of parental guidance to create a secure environment where my children know fairness and respect and can become the individuals they want to be. And that leads on to the benefits to homeschooling which come from a more balanced family life. This is your child and their childhood. You don't get another chance at either.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">The fact is school generates problems and behaviour home educating families simply don't have to face and the reasons aren't hard to find. Having friends is great; being stuck with up to 30 children all day is something else. It's un-natural. The sheer power of peer pressure has been well documented - everything from the latest iPod to the increasing trend towards early sexualization. Why Home School? Homeschooling benefits include having much more positive ways for your child to make friends and learn how to be a part of society. You can see the reasons why home school offers a much more grounded way of learning the social skills you need in our page on homeschooling socialization.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">More Benefits of Homeschooling There are many homeschooling benefits and one of the biggest reasons why parents choose to home school is obvious. Reasons For Homeschooling US homeschool statistics show that the most important reasons parents gave for why they chose home school was to offer religious or moral instruction (36%). Homeschooling Benefits But overall you'll find there are many advantages. When I realize how quickly my first child is growing up, how life is flying by at top notch speed, I long for more time to drink my children in... to watch as they dance outside under the sun, to plant the garden together, to snuggle together and read a book.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">That TIME with them is once in a lifetime and I am not willing to give it up. I want to keep my children's hearts at home, not rented out to peers, sports, or other activities - and to do that, being at home with them is a huge first step. When I think of all the relationships I've had growing up - good "friends" and hurtful "friends", and look back to see none of them remain... all the tears I cried over some of the pain they caused me with the usual catty girl behavior, all the time wasted with people I will never see again. And then compare that to spending our everyday bonding and building our most important relationships for life... siblings, parents and children, grandparents, and even cousins, the difference is vast. Keep them close, keep them young, keep them home... what a joy! There are so many wonderful reasons to homeschool. Here are a few from our family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">Jesus : We homeschool because we are able to seek Jesus everyday with our children. We still mess up. It's a somewhat sloppy, beautiful thing, that we receive as a blessing; pressing on and growing in Him, together. Flexibility :  By homeschooling we are not held to the schedule set by a school. We homeschool year-round which affords us a continuous learning atmosphere. We take many travels and breaks peppered throughout our year (you can read about those here under roadschooling ). We can plan our school time around daddy's schedule.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">If he has days off during the week we can take advantage of that extra time with him too. Time :  Huge, this time-thing is. We don't get much of it; time is a gift . Our children's childhood really is a short, short puff of smoke. For awhile I felt like I was missing quite a bit. The Lord impressed upon my heart to lay down my career and come home full-time . Time is why many homeschooling families highlight the significance of  Deuteronomy 6:6-8.</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. All this impressing, talking, sitting, walking, and getting up together takes the investment of time. Relationships :  We value our relationship with our children. We like being with them, and they like being with us. Beyond us our children are able to cultivate their relationships with one another. In addition, the kids can spend time with Grandparents and friends who might otherwise be distant to them. My mom is very supportive of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="28">She invests her time and energy into her relationship with each child. Be it time at her mountain farm, horseback riding or ice skating, the children are blessed to be able to soak this time with her up! Shelter : I want to protect our children from being taught about pole dancing at the lunch table {true story from a reading friend}. I think it's a good thing for childhood innocence to be kept in-tact to whatever degree it may. Which goes along with... Childhood :  This is huge in my book. Childhood seems to have all but disappeared from our society.</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">Lifelong Learners :  The goal of our homeschooling is not to raise Harvard alumni. Our goal is to teach our children how to learn. We want to instill a love in them for the Word, and all other great disciplines that the Lord designed. God is the master scientist and mathematician. Through home education our entire family is developing healthy habits of seeking information on various areas of interest. Exposure to the World: As a balance we know our children will be exposed to the world, and this revelation comes along with family guidance. They've seen the male cashier at Wal-Mart wearing nail polish and a dress.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">We've been to the beach and had to discuss how those ladies need to cover up their bodies because that is only for their husband when they're married. Even alcohol, tobacco, abortion and kidnapping;  all topics that we discuss as a family. Physical Safety :  Keeping our kids away from drugs, gangs, profanity, violence, and bullies is a good thing! Courtship: Another aspect of life that my husband and I learned about late is courtship. What a beautiful idea that the Lord already has your spouse predestined for each person. No need to date around before marriage. Readiness and Individualized Curriculum :   One of our sons was not showing signs of reading readiness until age-7 &#189;, however he'd construct clever creations for hours, and devoured any and all forms of tactile learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">Both are gifted and brilliant in their individual ways, and both have thrived receiving a custom education. "To protect their minds from wrong teaching until they are strong enough in their faith to counter it!" But the biggest is for my kids' protection (spiritual, emotional and physical). Innocence is so no longer valued in our society, so in order to preserve it as parents, the best thing we can do is to shelter and nurture them until they are prepared to handle the "real world." "Fellowship with them, discipleship, training, life skills, example teaching, better academic attention, convenience with our military lifestyle, flexibility with our schedule in general. "#1 reason so that my son has a place that has no restrictions on being taught about Jesus and to protect his mind spiritually, emotionally. To embrace every single moment of his journey.</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">Having no restrictions on anything he wants to study. Most of all-embracing the lessons that the Lord is using my child to teach me &#9829;" I have been making a mental list lately of my own reasons for wanting to homeschool our children and the protection of our children is a key reason for our decision. I've been reluctant to homeschool for personal reasons, but as our eldest gets closer to school-age am finding it extremely difficult to imagine sending her to a school where her primary influence-her daddy &amp; me-will be replaced, or at least challenged, by a teacher &amp; her peers. A 5-year-old needs her parents! However, I like that homeschooling offers me the decision of WHEN, WHERE, and HOW to introduce topics that only a parent-not a school-should discuss. This short article discusses why homeschooling often fits the unique educational needs of the highly gifted.</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">In Tolan's critique of contemporary schools and classrooms and their difficulties in meeting the needs of gifted students, she outlines many solid reasons a family might give for choosing homeschooling instead. Both children are also accomplished musicians. Homeschooling is Efficient. A) Public school students spend approximately 1,100 hours in school a year. Yet only twenty percent of that time, 220 hours, is actually spent "on task" (Colfax 46). B) Homeschooling is dramatically more efficient, with three times more time actually spent working, and ample time left for other activities (Colfax 46). C) Children taught at home can work in quiet surroundings, not having to worry about unprepared teachers or waiting for a teacher to deal with bothersome, noisy children (Clark XVII).</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">Homeschooling Enables Children to Learn at Their Own Pace. A) It is common knowledge that children mature at different rates, yet too often the public school's context of a "good" child is one who "fits or is able to adapt to curricular stereotypes, learning what is given when it is given" (Colfax 41). C) Parents homeschooling their children are able to speed up or slow down schoolwork, unconstrained with governmentally-approved curriculums or work having to be handed in at a certain time (Colfax 48). Homeschooling Fosters Positive Socialization. A) "If there were no other reason for wanting to keep kids out of school, the social life would be reason enough&#65533;it is mean-spirited,&#65533;exclusive, status-seeking, and snobbish" (Holt 44-45). B) Homeschooled parents have chosen to protect their children from negative socialization, but their children are "seldom, if ever, socially isolated. Indeed, precisely because they have more opportunities to interact with a wide range of people, they tend to become more socially competent and socially responsible at an earlier age than most of their conventionally schooled peers" (Colfax 101).</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">Homeschooling Discourages Peer Dependence. A) Peer pressure often does little to foster intellectual growth and desirable social values (Colfax 101). B) Homeschooled children, on the other hand, model themselves on their parents, and not some "cool goof" who in turn models himself on some other peer. C) The net result of this respecting of one's parents is mature children who will "&#65533;benefit the community because they aren't shaped by peers but by parents who teach their children about the current problems in society" (Clark XXI). A) Because of all the time homeschooled children spend with their parents, it is much more likely that the children will retain their parents' values. Abstract "Homeschooling: The Best Form of Education" gives a basic background of homeschooling and discusses the reasons why many people believe that homeschooling is the best form of education. The main topics in the paper are the following: the legality of homeschooling, parental qualifications for teaching their children, the efficiency of homeschooling, the freedom to work at one's own pace, socialization, peer pressure, and the transmission of parental values to their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">The paper does not claim that homeschooling works for everyone, but it shows that the benefits greatly outweigh any negative aspects of this form of education. I had written a short paper on homeschooling in my sophomore year of high school, so I already had a good idea as to what I wanted my paper to address. As my parents own a multitude of books on homeschooling, it was a simple task to find sources for my paper. The only problems I encountered were finding the correct format to use for citing material from the ERIC system, and getting enough information on parental values to include in my paper. I could have researched into the statistics which compare homeschool students' academic achievements with public school students' achievements. Or I could have written a paper telling parents how to teach their children at home. Homeschooling Encourages Transmission of Parental Values to Children People of all different races, backgrounds, and religions have chosen to homeschool their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">All these parents have one thing in common: they want to control the content of what their children are learning so that they are not "filled, labeled, crated, and shipped out" according to some authority's work order (Colfax 38). Homeschooling gives children a much greater chance of retaining their parents' values because of all the time they are spending with them. It "allows families to incorporate their personal religious beliefs and values into all areas of the curriculum" (Martin 3). For example, if the family is Christian, they can have their handwriting practice revolve around the Scriptures, and incorporate the Bible into their reading (4). Environmentalists can personally teach their children to respect and care for nature, and secularists may simply want to teach their children to work hard and achieve academic excellence. Homeschooling permits everyone, regardless of the values they have, to effectively convey them to their children. "I know that my parents have taught me extremely good values that, had I not been homeschooled, would have been difficult to teach.</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">In this sense my values and morals have been a benefit of homeschooling&#65533;As far as [the impact on] society, I believe that everyone immediately impacts society with his or her beliefs, morals, and values, therefore I believe I do benefit society&#65533;." America's social well-being depends on the children of today, and if these children do not have basic moral values, America cannot survive. As long as homeschooling parents strive to teach their children positive values and morals, the homeschool movement will play a vital role in assuring our country's bright future. A) "Homeschooling is now legal in all 50 states" (Martin 6). B) "The law protects homeschoolers, and always has" (Heidtke 1990). Parents are Qualified to Homeschool Their Own Children. A) Parents teach their children right from the beginning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="39">B) Parents take advantage of "family bonds, good communication, and the children's natural desire to learn to offset the lack of a teaching certificate. And they get good results, with homeschooled children doing better on the average academically, in states where universal testing s required, than children in school" (Matrisciano 35). C) If parents are able to "read with understanding, write with meaning, speak clearly, and add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and if [they] love and respond to [their] children, [they] can be a good teacher" (Moore 9)! D) "&#65533;Parents don't have to learn things before their kids - just encourage them or learn it with them&#65533;" (Sheffer 1). E) Parents also can "use formal, prepackaged curricula, and &#65533;do what even teachers in schools have been known to do: stay one lesson ahead of the students" (Matrisciano 35). B) If a child is not ready to learn when age-oriented teachers are ready to teach, no learning will take place (44). Homeschooling Encourages Transmission of Parental Values to Children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="40">B) Homeschooling "allows families to incorporate their personal religious beliefs and values into all areas of the curriculum" (Martin 3). There were several different approaches I could have taken with my paper on homeschooling. Homeschooling Gives Children More Personal Attention Because of the lack of time and large classes, teachers are, quite often, unable to give special attention to certain students. Homeschooling, on the other hand, excels at undivided help. The parents, not having to worry about a lot of children, taking attendance, or dealing with administrative details, can give more and faster attention to a child in need of assistance. They can personalize their help to correspond with their children's strengths and weaknesses by spending extra time on difficult subjects and quickly skimming through those which the child has already mastered. Homeschooling Enables Children to Learn at Their Own Pace Perhaps one of the most pervasive forms of child abuse is to force a child to go to school before he is ready.</paragraph><paragraph parID="41">Children mature at different rates, yet too often the public school's context of a "good" child is one who "fits or is able to adapt to curricular stereotypes, learning what is given when it is given" (Colfax 41). If a child is not ready to learn when age-oriented teachers are ready to teach, no learning will take place (44). On the other hand, if some children are fast learners, what "is the point of forcing [them] to do so many minutes, hours, and days of 'school work' if they can learn the material in less than the specified time" (Matrisciano 34)? Parents homeschooling their children are able to speed up or slow down schoolwork, unconstrained with governmentally-approved curriculums or work having to be handed in at a certain time (Colfax 48). They are able to help their children advance at the appropriate speed necessary for them to understand what is being learned. These homeschooled children will grow to be adults who are more confident in their parents' concern for their welfare and education. On the other hand, this freedom to learn at one's own pace can have negative aspects.</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">If parents don't fully commit themselves to homeschooling, their children may get away with doing very little schoolwork at all. When there is little or no pressure to get an assignment done by a certain time, children may simply keep putting it off. Parents need to oversee their children's learning and use their parental authority to be sure they are actually doing their schoolwork. Homeschooling Fosters Positive Socialization "If there were no other reason for wanting to keep kids out of school, the social life would be reason enough&#65533;it is mean-spirited,&#65533;exclusive, status-seeking, and snobbish" (Holt 44-45). "The assumption is that the socialization process at public schools is normal and good," says Stephen Moitozo. "I'll tell you what normal isn't. Homeschooling families are taking to heart what The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: "The role of the parents in education is of such importance that it is almost impossible to provide an adequate substitute" (536).</paragraph><paragraph parID="43">They truly believe that there is not a valid replacement for themselves, and so they take it upon their shoulders to teach their children at home rather than at school. Though there are many factors, it is believed that parents mainly do so for religious reasons. LaRue (1991) reported that eighty-six percent of parents surveyed responded that they homeschool for religious reasons. They feel that their children do not obtain moral and ethical training, much less religious values, in American's public schools" (Pearson 1-2). Another main reason is that many people simply do not like public schools. In a Gallup Poll, 45% of Americans said they were unhappy with the public schools (Lyman 2). Negative peer pressure, safety, and drugs are all major concerns for those who have taken their children out of school or who have never put them in school (9).</paragraph><paragraph parID="44">Other reasons for homeschooling are that parents feel it is their business, and not the government's, to raise their children; others simply enjoy being with their children and don't want to give them up (Holt 13). Some homeschoolers feel that "&#65533;It's healthier for children to be with adults and with other people of all ages rather than a class of all kids their own age&#65533;" (Zugschwerdt 1989). Also, "&#65533;Others &#65533;would be hard-pressed to say why, exactly, they teach their children at home" (Colfax 37). To sum it up, "&#65533;If we truly look at the basic reason [people] homeschool, we'll find that it simply comes down to the fact that no one will ever love [their] children as much as [they] do" (Dickerson 3). Parental Qualifications for Homeschooling "According to child development specialists, most children learn nearly half of all they will ever learn by the time they are four or five years old. While many people claim that parents without credential are not capable of teaching, homeschooling families rely on "family bonds, good communication, and the children's natural desire to learn to offset the lack of a teaching certificate. And they get good results, with homeschooled children doing better on the average academically, in states where universal testing is required, than children in school" (Matrisciano 35).</paragraph><paragraph parID="45">If parents are able to "read with understanding, write with meaning, speak clearly, and add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and if [they] love and respond to [their] children, [they] can be a good teacher" (Moore 9)! A sixteen-year-old homeschooler said, "Most of the things I'm interested in are things that my mom doesn't know anything about, so I just learn them on my own and from other people&#65533;Parents don't have to learn things before their kids - just encourage them or learn it with them&#65533;" (Sheffer 1). Homeschooling is Efficient Public school children spend a large portion of their time in school. More than two hours a day are wasted going to and from school, in the homeroom, between classes, and settling down in and leaving class (Clark XXVI). Homeschooling is dramatically more efficient, with three times more time actually spent working. This gives children the extra time needed to pursue other educational interests such as learning to play the violin or studying ornithology (Colfax 46). Children taught at home can work in quiet surroundings, not having to worry about unprepared teachers or waiting for a teacher to deal with bothersome, noisy children (Clark XVII).</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">Homeschooling helps make the best use of one's precious childhood. Homeschooling Prevents Children From Unnecessary Review Another benefit of homeschooling is that the child is not re-taught what he already knows. In public school, with a different teacher every year who may not know what has been taught in the past, children may get taught the same things over again. Homeschooling, however, is like getting an education from a personal tutor, saving the kids from having to deal with the frustration of learning so much of the same thing. Parents know intimately what the child has learned since they have worked with their children for the past days, weeks, months, and years. Besides giving a general overview, they can just keep going forward (XVIII). Picture a child, academically ahead of his grade in class, forced by the teacher to do the work that the others are doing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">The child may be punished for not doing it and even threatened with having to repeat the grade. He is being punished for knowing more than the others! The other aspect would be the child who is behind the other children in his class. He cannot do the homework and the teacher, for various reasons, is not able to give him special attention. The result is that he gets even further behind (Holt 26-27). A homeschooler who had previously gone to public school described the social life there as "being cooped up with twenty-five other kids your age, having to wear the most up-to-date clothes, [and] people not speaking to you because you don't have the latest toy" (Sheffer 2). Ben, A Ferris State University student who had previously been homeschooled, commented that "&#65533;being around adults [as a homeschooler] didn't hurt me because I think I matured quicker and have less difficulty interacting with adults."</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">Jennie Chancey, a graduated homeschooler, said: "&#65533;It was really homeschool 'socializing' that helped me get where I am today! Mom and Dad encouraged us to talk with both older and younger people, and&#65533;I quickly felt at home getting to know people&#65533;I had no problems relating to the people who called me on the job to get statistics, set up interviews, or just chat about education. Homeschooling prepared me for this" (Duffy 37). Due to all these different experiences I've had, I feel comfortable communicating with people of all ages and walks of life. Homeschooling has never hurt me socially; it has only ever helped by allowing me these opportunities. Homeschoolers are effectively preparing themselves for adulthood by frequently socializing with all types of people. Homeschooling Discourages Peer Dependence Peer pressure, which is closely-linked to the socialization issue, is another reason why homeschooling is being advocated all over the world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">Homeschooled children, on the other hand, model themselves on their parents, and not some "cool goof" who in turn models himself on some other peer. The net result of this respecting of one's parents is mature children who will "&#65533;benefit the community because they aren't shaped by peers but by parents who teach their children about the current problems in society" (Clark XXI). When a firm foundation has been laid by the parents, the children will grow into responsible adults who have been taught how to discern right from wrong. Homeschooling parents have greater freedom to choose what they will allow their children to become involved in and the ability to ensure that their children do not become too dependent on their peers. At least homeschooling parents are standing up and making a conscious choice. Since homeschoolers have more flexibility and choice in their lives (both kids and parents), do we have a better chance of being lucky? As homeschoolers, we can pursue our dreams as soon as we have them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">And since we have endless time, we can determine quickly what works and what doesn't. Homeschoolers can have many, many dreams. We aren't limited to the one dream we have all of our lives "when we're finally done with school". We can do what our dreams are now. And find out, for real, if our dreams are what we really want to do. Scrutinizing my kids became my purpose. The times I had my hobbies in order, and felt like I had my own meaning, I was a better parent, a better teacher, and our homeschooling was overall more effective.</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">Case in point: I've been learning about social networking and social bookmarking. I'm pretty tech savvy, but this is giving me quite a bit of a challenge. I prefer the term " zenschooling ," since it is more in line with how I process the concept of education, and how we practice it as a family. I was pleasantly surprised to discover another term that resonates with us - " worldschooling ." Chelsea Link says this about her extraordinary, yet relaxed, life: "I think I've had a pretty normal high school experience . . . just without the high school." Another interesting quote by Christopher Watson , admissions dean at Northwestern, "We haven't changed the way we review applications, but the way home-schoolers are submitting applications has changed," he said. 5 things in 2007 made a difference for me.</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">And for 2008, they will be must-haves for our homeschooling success. 1) A place to work. 2) My own hobbies. It may not seem like having my own hobbies is important for homeschooling. 3) A hug in the morning and a hug at night. 4) Tape, paint, paper, pencils, markers, marbles and paper towel rolls. 5) Free time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">Equipped with these five homeschooling must-haves, we're ready to have a fantastic year. "'good public school' -Now that's an oxymoron if I've ever heard one. With public schools it's not a matter of whether they are good or bad. When someone says school, or homeschool or parents or whatever is "bad", I immediately wonder what they are talking about. But since every person has different criteria for a good education, what one person would consider a "good" school, another person will see it as "bad". One person sees test scores, graduation rates and credentialed teachers, another sees gangs, unhealthy competition and socialist indoctrination. Everyone's opinion of whether an educational program is "good" or 'bad" is based on their internal system of beliefs and experiences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">Although I believe that homeschooling is indeed the most flexible, and everyone is fully capable of homeschooling if that's what their desire and intention is, I still don't see homeschooling as some kind of elevated plane of existence. Because if we don't agree on that basic premise (which we probably won't), then what that person says is "better" about homeschooling, may actually be "worse" in my eyes. Everyone is a genius in their own right. There are those who are gifted in communication, in motivating others, in dealing with stress, in explaining things, in remembering details, in managing people and projects, in being organized, in seeing the true nature of people... There are so many ways to be gifted, and most of them are overlooked because they can't be measured. There are many good things about home schooling but there is one very big flaw to it as I am lead to believe. For now in their formative years I think it might be best for them at home. It isolates the children from larger numbers of kids and teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">They live in a kind of bubble. Bullying can be experienced in school for example, but it can ALSO be experienced outside of school, when playing with other kids, so are you going to prevent your kids from playing unobserved? Personally, I went to public school and public school is definitely NOT in most cases about getting people to think independently, but I doubt most homeschool does this either. It\'s really true, I hear so many people talk about homeschooling in the context of getting away from something else, or their only choice given their circumstances. Only occasionally do you hear of someone truly embracing homeschooling for the positives of homeschooling and not accompanied by the negatives of something else. My kids might get involved with the wrong crowd. My kids might be influenced in a negative way.</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">My kids might be teased and bullied. My kids might be abused. If your public schools are actually dangerous, then it is wise to keep your children out of them. The public schools in our area are not dangerous. They just don't offer the same advantages as homeschooling. I grew up in a small town and went to both a private Christian school and a public school (for high school). The public schools were not dangerous.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">Of course our kids could be happy in the right school and of course they would get an education and make friends but that isn't the reason for homeschooling, when you can see your children thrive on love and attention all day, when you know that you are the only one patient enough to sit with the beginner reader that just isn't beginning, or let your inventor create from recycling all day and call it "technology school." I am considering homeschooling, in fact very excited about it but at the same time I am scared to death I wont do a good enough job. As bad as public schools can be, homeschools can be amazing. For all the reasons that public schools are undesirable, homeschools can be wonderful. I have been thinking about homeschooling and fear has been a motivator. Homeschooling was our choice made with faith and conviction. With just 3 years of schooling left for my eldest, I have never had 1 day of homeschooling tainted by fear.</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">What I really meant to say is that my homeschooling choices were not motivated by fear ... but motherhood and parenting is full of uncertainties, insecurities, anxieties and ... fear. When people ask us about homeschooling, I honestly don't even bring the local public schools up because they really weren't a major factor in our decision. In my 21 years of homeschooling, I have seen many people motivated by fear. I am not surprised to see people homeschooling out of fear. It's people like you who see the joy and adventure of homeschooling that should be the inspiration for others. I have a student now who has been pulled out to "homeschool" for the third time and she is only in first grade. During the Summer I homeschool my girls and teaching at home or in a school setting is serious job.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">I work in a public school, and yet I am a huge advocate for homeschooling. When (if) I have my own kids, I hope to be able to homeschool them. Like you said, it has nothing to do with fear, or that public schools are "bad," only that homeschooling, in most cases, is better. I was talking to a homeschooling mom today who mentioned that she bakes bread EVERY DAY with her three homeschooled children (ages 5, 6, and 7)-what better way to teach math and science? Public school is a necessity because not every parent has the skills, resources, or desire to homeschool, but when it comes time, I'd rather homeschool my kids. Thank you for these kind words of reason as our family struggles with the decision of whether or not to homeschool. I do believe that the driving force behind one's reasoning to homeschool will become a factor of whether you succeed or not.</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">My two sons were homeschooled from K-12th grade. I love one of your reasons to homeschool was this: Belief that thinking independently is of greater value than learning to "perform," and a more valuable skill to have in the "real world" It is useful to have an arsenal of "reasons" for our homeschool decision, since we are challenged about it by nearly everyone we meet-family, friend, and stranger alike. So true, and I hate when other people think we are homeschooling from a place of fear - that we want to keep our children from ever experiencing difficulties, that we want to avoid a certain kind of person, etc. We love the freedom home schooling brings and the rate at which children can grow in all different areas of their lives. Not to mention being interested in why others not only choose to but continue home schooling their blessings from the Lord. Yet my desire to spend more time with my daughter and give her a free-er, more individual education motivates me more, helping her to have a desire to learn more than learn what will be tested in our state.</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">Right now I'm being motivated more by a fear of not making it financially if I should quit my job or go down to working part-time. When we started out more than 12 years ago, I just followed my heart. It came with the rest of my parenting decisions, but I always maintained that "nothing is cast in stone". Even as I look to my high schooler's future, I trust the Lord to lead and guide us. I'm grateful almost daily for the loving, intimate, inspiring, fun, learning journey our family is on together! We wanted what was best for our family and, at this point, this is it! When we are convinced that homeschooling is best for us and our family, it becomes a joy, despite the rough days!</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">I am always hearing people talk about being afraid of something or other. I personally used to be a fearful person and it kept me from enjoying a rich life. Funny thing is, my life has never been better since. I have done things I only dreamed of, made friends I always wanted, and found the career path that would make me truly happy. Avoiding it is always the easiest way. AprilS's latest post: Chemistry - Theoretical Yield and Percent Yield I'm a speech-language pathologist in a public school and have seen the good, bad and ugly of home schooled kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">Those that are doing it and doing it well and those whose students are entered and pulled out of school repeatedly. She is behind in all areas not because of low cognitive abilities but because of lack of consistent instruction. I have the utmost respect for parents who are teaching God's principals, organized, consistent and serious about their children's education. At the same time, I don't always view fear in the negative. I DO have fear at the thought of another person having too much authority over my kids. Of course there are MANY reasons why I choose both of those paths. Even one on one, there is only so much you can do in a public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">Fear was definitely a motivating factor, but you have shown that there is so much more to focus on. It was a very challenging process, but it got better the simpler the process got. We received negative feedback or just plain indifference a lot of the time. Not much encouragement from others, but I knew in my heart of heart that this is what God wanted me to do. Being that I had a negative school experience myself. Plus, my husband was not always on the same page. So I had to come from the approach that I was supporting my sons with something that I didn't get, and truly needed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">The whole experience has enriched our lives in so many ways. This has been one of my concerns for our son who has been public and private schooled and is now going into 5th grade. He's very competitive and know that the quality of his work isn't what it could be because he's trying to finsih faster or he allows himself to feel immense pressure to keep up with the kid next to him. Just as an example, I was physically and verbally abused within inches of suicide for most of my middle school years. When my daughter was in public school, I could NOT get her to write "Merry Christmas" on our family cards that we were about to mail. They had lessons on important religious holidays, Learning about Ramadan and Diwali and Hannukuh, explaining the religious meanings... but for Christianity they talked about "Santa Claus." We try to let people know how wonderful this life and learning is, but often their minds are shut too tight against it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">Should we work to keep our kids safe? Of course. Worrying about everything that "might" or "possibly could, maybe happen" is foolish. I am just starting the Homeschooling journey, officially in the fall, for First Grade. I have met many HSers and Christian-schoolers who are so fearful of their children being "stained" by the world. While we absolutely must protect our children, I don't think that HSing or Christian school is the only way, nor should your main motivation for HSing or Christian school be to play "keep away". I find many people assume we homeschool because of things we don't like about the public school system - I think a lot of us have probably encountered that, "Oh, you must homeschool because you hate the school system ..."</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">Kids need to learn how to deal with life, real life, just not the one where there are never any skinned knees. At some point, your kids are going to have to leave and be on their own... at at that point, they need to know how to deal with life as it is, not as we'd like it to be. I want my little girl to be confident and capable of handling herself in any situation - to know what to do and not freak out when it happens. THAT is to me what preparing my child for her future is, not keeping her so sheltered in the little bubble that the world overwhelms her. The kids would still get unstructured time outside, you wouldn't be hovering over them, and you'd still know if something went wrong. But our 10 year has high functioning autism and daily living skills are what is important to us to become a functioning member of society. Education is not a one size fits all.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">I believe 'fear' can be such a common motivation among well-meaning parents and they don't find the inspiration and positive philosophy of an alternate method of education that can transform their focus into offering children a totally different approach to learning which can far outweigh what the traditional school setting has to offer. But actually, we just love homeschooling. We love seeing our children learning every day. We like just being together! Recently on one of the HS boards I belong to a mother said she didn't want her son to be forced to sit next to drug addicts in the public middle school, so they homeschooled. I chose to homeschool my daughter because it suited her needs, and I feel that I can give her the kind of education she requires, which the public system cannot. I agree that the best reasons to HS are because of all the positive aspects of HSing instead of the negative aspects of SOTH (school outside the home).</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">The biggest reason we HS is because it is quite simply a wonderful way of life for us! Bullies, unsafe conditions, bad messages and administrators that push test scores above what's best for children are all very real concerns in even the "best" schools (and among my friends in the Twin Cities area, every one claims that her child's school has been deemed "best"). Listening to what was going on in our good, safe, well respected, small town elementary school was also a factor. Don't home school out of fear, but out of a desire to please God by discipling your children and providing them with the best opportunities and the best teacher in the world, their mom! Now, my response to why we homeschool is that we have chosen to take on/deal with the challenges of homeschooling rather than the challenges of school. I have to confess that after reading your list of reasons not to homeschool, fear was probably the driving force that brought us to homeschooling our little ones. The time I have spent with my kids in our first year has been amazing!</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">I wouldn't say it was actually FEAR that made them choose to homeschool, but a healthy concern about the reality of what exists in all school settings at some level. Most of the homeschooling parents I've met over the last 13 years of our homeschooling journey have been led to homeschool for reasons that fit their child/ children and support the kind of family life they want to live. I wouldn't say it was actually FEAR alone that made them choose to homeschool, but a healthy concern about the reality of what exists in all school settings at some level. To remember the why for our own families! My intention is not to simply make a list of the benefits (like getting to sleep in) but to really go deeper into the heart of the issue to understand why I, personally, am homeschooling my children. The reason I started homeschooling was simply because I was homeschooled. It's familiar to them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">They understand the process and how to go about registering their kids. They have a working knowledge of the system and what will be required of them, because they have been there themselves. To them, homeschooling is mysterious, full of ambiguity and questions. Concerns about socialization and college cause them to usually choose the "safer" choice -- the one with which they are familiar. I don't think a lot of parents really even consider any other choices -- public school is often chosen by default. In the same way, I am familiar with homeschooling because I was homeschooled. Obviously, if a homeschool graduate marries a public school graduate the two may later decide on a different education option, but the study demonstrates that most people educate their children in the same way they were educated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">It was a natural, easy decision for us to make. We started off with public school for them (our oldest has returned to public school for 8th grade) but have decided that homeschooling for at least through elementary school is what is best - for right now. Why I Homeschool--Part One: (Because I was homeschooled) Posted Tuesday, November 29, 2011, at 8:27 AM I wanted to take the next few blog posts to answer the classic question of why I homeschool. This is a question that I have been asked over and over when people find out that none of my children have ever been to a public school. There isn't one, quick answer to that question.</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">Not only that, the reasons I homeschool today aren't necessarily the same as the reasons I started homeschooling years ago. Since the reasons are complex, I can't just make an easy list. Just Google "Top Ten Reasons I Homeschool" and you will find pages of links to sites with lists of reasons ranging from profound to controversial to funny. I'm also going to refrain from giving a number, because I don't know for sure how many reasons I have yet. There might be 10, but what if I get to 10 and then think of a really awesome number 11? You can see the problem, I'm sure. So I'll just start with the reason I first started homeschooling and go from there.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">This is very similar to the reason that most public schooled parents probably put their children in public schools. It's what they are used to. So was my husband. When we got married 15 years ago, we didn't even discuss whether or not we would homeschool our children or not -- it was just sort of understood that we would, and so we did. According to a 2003 study by Dr. Brian D. Ray, (http://www.hslda.org/research/ray2003/homeschoolinggrowsup.pdf), 82% of homeschool graduates said they would homeschool their own children. You see, as a homeschool graduate, I knew firsthand that homeschoolers have friends, because I had friends. I would roll my eyes when we were asked if we got tired of being home all the time, because sometimes we were never home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">I didn't have to worry about whether homeschoolers could compete academically with their public schooled peers, because I knew firsthand that we could. I knew how to pick out curriculum and how to teach a child to read. I knew how to plan a school year and keep records. I knew what homeschooling was and what it wasn't, what I needed to do and what I didn't. I didn't have to wring my hands and wonder if my kids would need therapy when they were adults, because I knew firsthand that homeschooling is a healthy environment for children. Homeschooling can be scary for those who have never tried it. For those of us who grew up with it and know firsthand what it's all about, it's difficult to imagine any other way of living.</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">While both my husband and I are graduates of public school, we've chosen to homeschool our children. I never thought I'd be a homeschooler... but we love it!!!! It's a complete lifestyle change, not just a schooling change. What college or university did you attend? I am assuming this since you know how to teach, choose a curriculum, and have a wide enough knowledge base to teach every subject first grade through graduation. You make yourself sound like super teacher. You say in your article that most parents choose public educaton by default, but that sounds like what you did.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">As for homeschool students being well prepared to further their education, I think that is a broad statement. No doubt there are some who are ready to go on, but what about those who return to the public system to find out they are one to two years behind? I am just saying you make homeschooling sound like the perfect world. Nothing is perfect regardless of how well you think you are preparing children for the real world. -- Posted by happyperson on Tue, Nov 29, 2011, at 5:02 PM Do I need to be a licensed teacher in order to prepare healthy meals for my kids? Does my husband need to be a licensed mechanic in order to fix his own car?</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that school boards choose curriculum in public schools. I'm also pretty sure most school board members are not licensed teachers. The biggest advantage I have is that since I was homeschooled myself, I have confidence that I know what I'm doing. Of course not all homeschooled children will excel. Neither will all public schooled children. Still, studies have shown that homeschoolers score better than their public schooled peers on every subject in every level. (http://www.hslda.org/docs/nche/000010/200410250.asp)</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">Is homeschooling the perfect world? No, but it's a good one, and I'm thankful that it's part of my world. -- Posted by LisaLuper on Wed, Nov 30, 2011, at 8:34 AM I hate to tell you this "happyperson", but some of the smartest and most talented people running around out there are not "licensed teachers". -- Posted by jdog on Wed, Nov 30, 2011, at 12:30 PM happyperson doesn't sound very happy. Homeschooling is one of those subjects where people feel it is okay to give their opinions regardless of whether it is requested or without thought of the homeschooling family's feelings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">Homeschooling is an educational choice surrounded by many myths and misconceptions. I prefer to make those [educational] choices myself. Not because I think I know 'better' than all those professional educators, but I do think I know my own children best, and consequently which programs and methods would benefit them. Homeschooling is not about rejecting other people and things; it's about making personal and positive choices for your own family. Homeschoolers understand that sheltering their children would not do any good; they will still be exposed to the violence in the world through other mediums. While school violence is now a leading factor in many parents' decisions there are usually many different reasons for choosing to homeschool. Even though this method continues to provide high national test scores and well rounded, diversely educated children, many people still do not see the virtue of this system or have a preconceived notion about what goes on in homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">Nevertheless, it does help to keep them safe by keeping them away from the current trend of school violence. The statistics state that 31.2 percent of home-schooling parents say that "concern about the environment of other schools" was their primary reason for home instruction while 16.5 percent stated "dissatisfaction with the academic instruction in other schools," 29.8 percent said "to provide religious or moral instruction," 6.5 percent was "because the child has a physical or mental health problem," 7.2 percent said "because the child has other special needs," and 8.8 percent gave "other reasons" (Fagan, 2007, p. 4). For my family it was a combination of the first three reasons-academic dissatisfaction being top-along with specific incidents that led us to consideration and the practice of homeschooling. Homeschoolers reside in the country, city, suburbs, and small towns (Lyman 9). Although homeschooling allows the freedom to easily impart values to susceptible children, this freedom like many others can be abused. If parents are transferring values which are harmful to society to their children, homeschooling could be the worst thing for the children. For homeschooling to succeed, parents need to constantly work to teach what is best for their children and society.Positive homeschooling is exemplified by Scotty's comments on his formation by his parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">Homeschooling is Legal. "Why Should I Homeschool?" Seton Home Study School Newsletter July 1998: 3. The definition of homeschooling is a: "Learning/teaching situation where children spend the majority of the conventional school day in or near their home in lieu of attendance at a conventional institution of education. Parents or guardians are the prime educators of their children" (Martin 2). The Number of People Homeschooling in the United States Homeschooling is "One of the fastest growing trends in the United States" (Martin 2). All parents need is a basic education to be able to teach a child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">Do Americans have the right not to send their children to school? The truth is, however, that "Homeschooling is now legal in all 50 states" (Martin 6). Yet, "Most homeschooled kids are routinely 'making social contacts' with other homeschoolers and with their friends, neighbors, and relatives. They get involved at the Y, in their churches, in community music and theater groups, in adult education classes, in family businesses, and in apprenticeships" (Matrisciano 35). The "real world" is not composed of people all the same age, but of different ages and backgrounds. Some are concerned about the challenge of teaching higher level courses. Others consider social issues, such as sports, prom, and graduation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">Many universities actively recruit homeschoolers, as they know they are independent learners who will take their education seriously. Apprenticeships  Homeschooling allows students to explore their interests to determine a future career. Flexible scheduling makes it possible to set up apprenticeships or internships in the student's fields of interest. Better to decide that you don't want to be a veterinarian after an internship than after many (expensive) years of college! Apprenticeships and internships, as well as job shadowing, can help a student who is not yet sure which career they want, to make an informed choice. Family Values  Some parents choose homeschooling to instill their own values and worldview into their children, rather than the values taught (by word or example) at the local traditional school. Continuing homeschooling gives them a chance to mature and make choices without the pressure or influence of a peer group.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">Flexibility Homeschooling provides so much flexibility that traditional schools cannot match. Students can work full or part time while continuing their high school education. Because homeschooling can be done any time of day, homeschool students can often work day shifts not available to other students. Flexibility in scheduling is a big plus for employers, making homeschoolers an attractive pool of potential employees. Many parents, even some who have confidently homeschooled through the elementary grades, wonder if they should send their child to a traditional school for high school. Academics  Statistically, homeschool students score higher on college entrance exams such as the ACT. High school students still need guidance in making good choices.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">In some cases, they may need you more at 15 than they did at 5! Of course, this flexibility could also allow a student to create his or her own business and become an entrepreneur rather than an employee! There are as many reasons to continue homeschooling as there are reasons to start, but I hope this brief list will encourage you to keep working with your children through high school graduation. There is a prevailing stereotype in the United States that homeschool education is racially prejudice (Butz, 2001; Danehy, 1999); that is, that white parents decide to homeschool their children because of their discriminatory opinions of other races. Taking this into consideration, the stereotype of white racist homeschoolers must be reexamined alongside the more feasible reasons for homeschooling, including the failing condition of America's public education system. In doing so, white homeschoolers will be revealed not as racists, but concerned parents with their children's best interests in mind. This often leads to the question of whether white homeschoolers are racist (Butz, 2001; Danehy, 1999), practicing homeschooling as a means of segregating their children from other races and ethnicities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">Minorities battle subtle forms of racism every day in public schools (Sarver, 2003), so it would be no surprise that the reason so many minorities are leaving public education may have to do with an attempt to escape the passive forms of institutional racism they are subjected to (Boyden, Johnson, and Pittz, 2001). Finding available research regarding ethnic discrimination within homeschooling and how this relates to political influences has been less than successful. There are studies that have determined many parental reasons for homeschooling, and none have established racism as a cause (Anderson, 2000; Bauman. By the late 1990s, it was determined that 9.9 percent of all homeschooled children were black, and 48.9 percent of black homeschooling parents felt their children could get a better education at home (Holland, 2001). As more Americans continue to hear about homeschool successes in the United States, and as many of these same Americans begin to feel a sense of betrayal on the part of public education, we can see why so many Americans are willing to turn to this alternative form of education (Albert, 2003; Arsen, 2003; Haberman, 2003). As long as they are free of institutionally supported racism, minority students perform as well as white students; they are able to fully meet their true potential in a loving parentally supported homeschool environment. Children given the proper atmosphere and opportunity will prosper and do well in life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">It has been determined that minority and white students test out at equivalent levels when they are homeschooled (Gillespie, 1997). However, when minority students are compared to white students in a public school setting, significant academic differences appear. White students test at substantially higher levels then their ethnic counterparts in public school environments. The issue of class distinctions should be immediately dispelled, unless a student attends a public school (Gillespie, 1997; Ray, 1997; Wall Street Journal, 1997). American homeschoolers come from all walks of life Homeschoolers come from different races, socioeconomic environments and religions. American homeschoolers do have a proclivity for association.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">Homeschool parents should be free to direct the multicultural needs of their children (Limbaugh, 2002). Concerned homeschool parents of all ethnic groups should be able to make educational decisions free of any governmental control (Human Liberation Alliance, 2001). True Reasons for Homeschooling Despite what the National Education Association would have the public believe, homeschoolers have countless reasons for choosing to educate their children at home. An individual choice America can be proud of its free market economy, where people are allowed to seek out better opportunities for themselves and their families (Pore and Plainsman, 2002). This can be seen in today's contemporary homeschool movement as well (Rudner, 1999).</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">There is no central mechanism that controls America's homeschoolers, unlike that of America's public schools (Bielick, Chandler, &amp; Broughman, 1999). On the contrary, homeschoolers make an individual choice to teach their children, and enjoy the independence of teaching their children in the way they see fit. Usually, it would seem that groups based on either political, racial, religious or geographic locations often determine who and what type of organization a family might choose to participate in. There are also many families who do not participate or align themselves with an organization (Bielick, Chandler, and Broughman, 1999; Colson, 2000; McElroy, 2001; Sealhoff, 2000). This fractional separation gives the homeschool movement its strength to survive and succeed well into the future (Drennan, 2000). The homeschool movement is not collective with a singular mode of thinking, unlike that of the public schools today (Taylor, and Hughes, 2003; Mintz, 2003). Each family determines their own reasons for homeschooling, they might very well be religious, but more often the motivation for homeschooling appears to be the failure of public school education (Rado, 1999; Rudner, 1999).</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">With each family making singular decisions, independent of any central control mechanism, success is actually deemed a triumph for each family over America's educational monopoly (Cardiff, 1998; Colson, 2000; Ellis, 2003). Homeschool parents are finding their American heritage, and concluding that it does not take a governmental autocracy to educate a nation (Grigg, 1997; Heston, 1997; Kang, 2001; Krueger, 2000; Lieberman, 2000). Another reason parents choose homeschooling is to enjoy an enhanced intimacy with their children. Homeschooling augments the family relationship. Most homeschooling parents demonstrate their own passion for learning through that of their children. When concerned parents are presented with the opportunity to homeschool their children, many give it due consideration. After all, parents are the first teachers of their children's social values.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">Societal values are enhanced in a homeschool environment (Broadhurst, 1999). It is the love of teaching one's children that has enabled all ethnic groups to benefit from homeschooling (Colson, 2000; Lyman, 2002; McElroy, 2001). Another big reason for homeschooling is religion (Bielick, Chandler, and Broughman, 1999). This means homeschooled children are directed by their parents to interact with children of the same religion, not necessarily the same color (Anderson, 2000; Basham, 2001). Most religions today do not advocate ethnic segregation. The hallmark of the Christian faith today is the love of thy neighbor. It is the contention of this argument that most Christian faiths today allow interracial congregations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">This means that church activities allow all church children an opportunity to play and interact together, regardless of race (Potapov, 1987; Robinson, 2003). Another facet of this argument would be if a homeschooled family did not go to church, availability to interact is obtainable through homeschool support organizations, whereby all children have an opportunity to participate together (Shemitz, J. 2002). Available data proves that homeschooled children do well with parental guidance (Bauman. The top three finishers at the 2000 national spelling bee were all homeschooled by their parents. Four of the top ten finalists in the national geography bee were also homeschooled by their parents (Scott, 2000). Homeschool success results are often overlooked in an effort to discredit this movement (Anderson, 2000). So why would the National Education Association not deem parents qualified to teach (Schlafly, 1995; Schlafly, 2000; Sowell, 2000)?</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">Available data proves that homeschooled children are not affected by a lack of socialization (Bauman. Yet again, all too often many public school advocates consider homeschoolers either racist or fanatics (Clowes, 1995; Danehy, 1999; Goldfarb, 1999). This smear campaign is based on an attack in order to deflect actual blame for the failures of America's public schools (Johnson, Piana, and Burlingame, 2000; Johnson, Boyden, and Pittz, 2001; Limbaugh, 2002). Failure of the public schools Public school troubles don't end with financial problems. Teachers are questioning many public school policies. It has been determined that public school administrative pressures are driving teachers away.</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">It was asserted that fourth grade teachers were being held accountable for the failure of their students. Many of the skills the children did not know should have been taught in kindergarten. Shortly after Education Secretary Paige made his comment civil liberties and education groups called for his apology or resignation (Cooperman, 2003). Homeschooling is not to blame for the many failures of public education (Freund, 1997). Homeschooling cost less then public education (Wall Street Journal, 1997). Many students are being passed ahead to the next grade level even though they are not qualified to do so (McAvoy, 1998). Racism claims have been made evident in public schools as well as with homeschooling (Danehy, 1999; Boyden, Johnson, and Pittz, 2001).</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">With all this said, opponents of homeschooling still contend that public education is the only avenue for true racial integration and learning (Schlafly, 2000). The path of differences seems to be widening between homeschoolers and those of public educators (Marshal and Valle, 1996). There appears to be a concern that public support for public education is crumbling. Many public schools, unions, and educational bureaucrats, have done a lot to hurt American education today. Many local communities consider their public schools to be a waist of taxpayer money. This view is making it increasing harder to pass local tax increases for public education (Cloud and Morse, 2001). Furthermore, administrators and teachers are not held accountable for the failure of public schools today.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">The National Education Association is not held accountable to local school boards or parents. The National Education Association only answers to its membership. The National Education Association opposes everything and everyone in a continued quest to maintain its power base and influence with American education (Roberts, 2003). The NEA is also a formidable force behind the Democratic Party. Public education is a monopoly that does not want to loose control. The National Education Association's down fall will only come when teachers and parents abandon the public school system. Homeschooling has served to discredit public schools through its usage of less money, and better test scores (Roberts, 2003).</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">Teachers are leaving public school education due to a lack of professionalism, and collapsing educational standards. Due to this continued shortage many school districts are forced to import teachers from overseas under the H-1B visa program (Roberts, 2003). Many school districts have had to offer signing bonuses, reduced housing costs, and restaurant discounts. School districts are also forced into hiring retired military personnel and educated immigrants from foreign countries (Learning Machines, Inc., 2001). While concerned parents have decided to leave public education for the betterment of their children, public educators continue to espouse a failed system (Malkin, 2002). Teacher shortages are only one of many growing complaints of public education (Sappenfield, 2002). Homeschool parents have witnessed this failure first hand, and have decided to exit public schools for the development of their children (Kang, 2001).</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">Public schools that teach in high ethnic population centers have almost two times as many teachers who have no qualifications for the subjects in which they are teaching. Public schools that frequently serve minority students have teachers without qualifications in 29 percent of classes. Public schools are often overflowing with inferior math teachers who never specialized in math during college; French teachers teaching biology; art teachers teaching history; many have no education about the topics they have been assigned to teach. The public school systems main concern is the self-preservation of its tax-subsidized teachers, not educational enlightenment. Public education today may be bordering on malpractice (Malkin, 2002). Each state varies with regard to required regulations . Many homeschool families have learned to become ardently independent, stemming from their reluctance to succumb to governmental influence.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">Homeschoolers fear any influence that might allow a departure from their plans for educating their children, arguing that governmental regulations have led to the failure of America's once proud educational establishment. Homeschoolers believe that governmental control will lead to failure of the homeschooling movement as well (Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 2003). Racism History Early American education reinforced the idea of black inferiority. Credible scholars provided data to justify racial opinions in public education. Teachers were taught to reinforce the natural superiority of the white race. Public schools would teach the natural superiority of the white race.</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">The public schools became significant building blocks toward class racism within American society (Veris, 1996). Public school racism. Education in America has not always been accessible to ethnic minorities. Public education in America still singles out students of color for unfair treatment. Boyden, Johnson, and Pittz (2001) examined many educational policies and trends that impact students of color, and have determined the following: (a) public education often overlooks racially prejudicial regulations, which often lead to regrettable results, (b) public education censures individuals of color unfairly, and (c) public schools often redirect awareness and resources away from available solutions. The following recommendations must be applied to rid public education of institutional racism in the United States: (a) get rid of exit exams, (b) retract zero tolerance guidelines, (c) schools that perform in high need populations must be prioritized to receive adequate funding, and (d) schools must employ racial equity plans. The issue of white privilege is often used to explain the significance of diversity, racism, and its importance in the United States today.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">The matter of white privilege illustrates a better sense of how being white is often considered by other ethnic groups. White people are trained not to identify white privilege. Disapproving a system based on white privilege is not enough. Whites in the United States believe that racial discrimination does not involve them. Racism will not end until white people changed their attitudes toward people of color (McIntosh, 1988). Students of color continually struggle with racism as an issue that influences social opportunities. White students are uninformed about how white privilege affects their lives, and how this issue involves their view of the world (Cooper, 2000).</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">Perpetuating discrimination. The National Household Education Surveys Program (1999) reports that varying reasons were given for homeschooling, including (a) better education provided at home, (b) poor learning environments in public schools, and (c) religious reasons. Indeed, an increase in public school drug use, gang activity and violence has been found to be additional reasons for parents to homeschool their children. None of the studied indicators, however, determined racism was a cause for homeschooling (Bielick, Chandler, &amp; Broughman, 1999; Howie, 2003; McCain, 2001). A study by Knowles and Muchmore (1995) concluded that the issue of social development of homeschoolers is overstated. Homeschooled children develop normally with regard to social skill development. There are many reasons why parent's homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">Racism has not determined to be a reason. Homeschooled children are neither aided by nor diminished by their homeschooled environments (Clery, 1998). Home-based charter schooled students were not negatively influenced with regard to their homeschooled experiences and socialization capabilities (Butz, 2001). Research asserts that parents who homeschooled primarily sought a solid education for their children (Miles, 1995). With regard to motivating educational factors, Galloway &amp; Sutton (2000), discovered no significant dissimilarities between three sampled college bound areas, (a) regular high school students, (b) private high school students, and (c) homeschooled high school students. Racial imbalance is very common within American public education (AA Up-Beat, 2001). The homeschool movement is a better reflection of the wants and needs for America's children (Albert, 2003).</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">Parental school choice is not readily available to the poor. Many earlier attempts to brand homeschooling illegal have failed. No direct link has been determined that proves alternative forms of education or homeschooling harm a student's ability to interact with other racial groups (Boswell, 2002; Neiberger, 1996). Studies have reported many positive facts regarding America's homeschooling movement. The homeschool racism claim has not been considered in many prominent national studies (Bielick, Chandler, and Broughman, 1999; Lines, 1999; Ray, 1997). The racism subject to so inflammatory it is understandable why many have decided not to deal with this issue directly (Samuels, 2002). Danehy said he felt that homeschooling engaged in certain forms of racism, paranoia, and religious bigotry.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">The unfortunate aspect of Danehy's article is that he does not take into consideration that minorities in greater numbers are turning to America's homeschool movement. Many minority families are finding that homeschooling is an alternative to that of public school education (Bauman, 2001). The homeschool movement is not based on ethnic discrimination. Rather, there is an extensive conspiracy for cultural control by the National Education Association (Zysk, 2000). Politics is playing a decisive role in education today, and because of this the true educational needs of America's children are not being met (Thompson, 1994). Senator Charles Starr from Oregon, who is a member of the state's senate education committee; tells every parent who will listen to "Run, not walk," out of the public schools system (Oregonian News, 2003). Public schools are untouchable fixtures in America today, even if the schools have become inept, dangerous, and a waste of public revenue (Malkin, 2002).</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">Homeschoolers are outpacing more contemporary forms of education, like charter schools and vouchers. Minority families along with white families have discovered homeschooling. The homeschooling route has not yet been blocked by the special interests. Homeschoolers on the other hand are more concerned with the education of their children then any other issue (Seelhoff, 2000). Evans maintains that partisan politics is not and cannot be the only answer to America's educational problem (Center for Education Reform, 2003). It is because of such partisan politics that individual families from all walks of life are taking control of their children's education. They are no longer complaining about a failed public educational system.</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">Parents from all ethnic groups are homeschooling their children and teaching them their own values, not those of an institution based on class racism (Hegener, 2000; Littlepage, 2003; Richman, 2003; Seelhoff, 2000). In the meantime, those involved in the homeschooling movement seem to have gone mainstream (Colson, 2000; McElroy, 2001). Parents have decided to steward the education of America's children, rather than letting public educators. Yet, public educators want to displace parental teachings with those of national policies (Grigg, 1997). Educators have traditionally been the stewards of our cultural values, however, this is no longer the case. We are now witnessing educators and intellectuals manipulating social and cultural values (Gur-Ze'ev, 2000; Kjos, 2002). The hope of American education depends on the family, not on political leaders or the public school system.</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">There is nothing more important then erecting barriers between homeschooling and the power of public education, thereby restoring a families right to educate free individuals (Grigg, 1997). Public schools are insensitive and sometimes even harmful to children. Many families look for other educational options due to public school violence, and because of negative peer pressures; and many others leave public education because of a lack of support from teachers, administrators, and staff. Just as often parents expressed the opinion that their children became bored, and unmotivated in public school classrooms (Holland, 2001). Educational bureaucracies may also be at the center of many dysfunctional public schools. These bureaucracies continue to endure, while children of color become entrapped in a failed public school system. Children of color must attend public schools in 120 of the worst schools districts in the United States.</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">Yet many urban teachers are able to circumvent personal tragedy by not sending their own children to the schools in which they teach (Haberman, 2003). There is a central effort to maintain control of public education in the United States, which has led to its falter (Baxter, 2001; Grocke, 2003; Maxcy, 2002; Peterson, 1999; Schlafly, 2000). The issue of public school racism was clearly defined within the embodiment of this position paper (Arsen, 2003; Berlak, 2001; Duffy, 2003). Many of America's public schools continue to harbor discriminatory policies and actions by the very same teachers and administrators who are entrusted to eliminate its existence (Quade, 1998; Robinson, 2000; Schlafly, 1995; Schlafly, 2000; Star, 200; Thompson, 1994). The state of Florida currently has 41,128 students being educated at home, up from 10,039 in the 1991. Whatever the reason for the public school failure, it does not involve a lack of financial backing. It has been determined that each homeschool child's education cost is approximately $546 per year, compared to the yearly public school student's costs of $5,325 (Wall Street Journal, 1997).</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">As public schools continue to erode, greater pressure will be placed on the National Education Association and their proponents to discontinue alternative approaches to America's educational problems (Kang, 2001). Organizational control is a common theme used to explain why an organization does what it does to stay in power. The National Education Association worries about loosing students, financial support, employment, status, and control over the education of American students (Kasman, 2000). Homeschooled students could considerably increase the amount of state aid to public schools if only they were counted. The National Education Association may actually be perpetuating class racism in order to maintain its current status as America's premier educational organization (Archabald, Arsen, 2003; Baxter, 2001; 2003; Schlafly, 2000; Sowell, 2000; Varis, 1996; Weiss, 2002; Wrench, 2001; Zysk, 2000). Teachers are teaching subject matter, which they are not educated in, and teachers and administrators allow institutional racism to exist within America's public schools (Learning Machines, Inc, 2001; Malkin, 2002). Just because a child does not come into daily contact with children of another race does not make for a racism accusation (Littlepage, 2003; Mc Avoy, 1998; McCulloch, 2003).</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">What is not taken into consideration is that many homeschool children are not only of different ethnic backgrounds, many parents make sure that their children have opportunities to interact with other children (Basham, 2001; Bauman, 2001; Boswell, 2002; Scott, 2000; Wall Street Journal, 1997). Thirty years of award-winning teaching in New York City's public schools led John Gatto to the sad conclusion that compulsory governmental schooling does little but teach young people to follow orders as cogs in the industrial machine. The Schools Our Children Deserve Moving Beyond Traditional Classrooms and "Tougher Standards" by Kohn, Alfie Teacher-turned-writer Alfie Kohn takes on traditional-education giants like E.D. Hirsch, along with practically every state government "raising the bar" and toughening standards, in this attack on the back-to-basics movement. Left Back : A Century of Failed School Reforms by Ravitch, Diane Ravitch "Whenever the academic curriculum was diluted or minimized, large numbers of children were pushed through the school system without benefit of a genuine education," she writes. Subtle but pervasive racism at public and private schools spurred the Nabrits to homeschool their three sons, an option seldom taken by black parents. By many accounts, there is every reason to avoid public schools, with their low academic expectations for black children, their general avoidance of black history, and their reputation for violence and negative peer pressure. Also, much of the research in the past is about 10 years old, and there has been a rapid growth recently in homeschooling&#65533;people&#65533;s reasons for homeschooling may have changed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">In the 1990s, as homeschooling becomes more accepted and as debates about educational choice continue, there are more opportunities for families to choose homeschooling as an option for their children. In the past, parents usually had strong philosophical beliefs about homeschooling because of legal difficulties and negative perceptions of homeschooling. Homeschooling today is becoming easier due to the fact that battles about the legality of homeschooling are being resolved and there has been an explosion in the number of support groups and organizations. The results were organized into four sections: 1) characteristics of homeschooling parents, 2) coming to the decision to homeschool, 3) motivations for homeschooling and 4) attitudes towards the public education system. The purpose of this paper was to investigate some of the reasons parents choose to homeschool their children. Prof. Arai reviewed the findings on homeschooling (mainly from the U.S. since there is very little available in Canada) to develop a picture of what is known about the practice. He also did interviews with homeschooling families in Ontario and B.C. Finally, it is argued that Canadian homeschoolers are different from their American counterparts on several important dimensions and that these differences reflect a recent change in the nature of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">The existing literature on homeschooling shows that, in general, parents either did not accept the content of the school&#65533;s curriculum (referred to as &#65533;ideologues&#65533;) or were unhappy with the institutionalized nature of schooling (referred to as &#65533;pedagogues&#65533;). The ideological homeschoolers had a diversity of reasons for their dissatisfaction: 1) public schools did not provide either enough or the right kind of religious education; 2) parents of &#65533;gifted&#65533; or &#65533;bright&#65533; children felt that the regular school curriculum was not demanding enough to provide a challenge for their children. Among the pedagogical homeschoolers the &#65533;negative socialization&#65533; was a concern for the majority of parents&#65533;i.e. teasing, pranks and exclusionary behaviour could be extremely damaging to their child&#65533;s sense of self. Other pedagogues felt that learning in a highly structured environment was wrong and many parents rejected the hierarchical learning situation in schools. Both the ideologues and pedagogues did share some reasons for wanting to homeschool their children, such as: 1) creating a stronger family bond (family unity); 2) homeschooling provides a way to practice an alternative lifestyle (getting away from materialist and consumerist values); 3) many parents themselves had unpleasant memories of school when they were children; 4) homeschooling allows parents the right to be responsible for their childrens&#65533; education. There are reasons to expect that homeschooling in Canada will be different than in the U.S. There are different legal contexts surrounding homeschooling in the two countries.</paragraph><paragraph parID="115">Rules governing homeschooling vary from state to state and province to province. Data for this research were collected through interviews with 23 homeschooling families in Ontario and in B.C. Each interview lasted approximately 2 hours. Discussions also took place with key people in three provincial homeschooling organizations in B.C. and Ontario as well as attendance at three different homeschooling conferences in Ontario. The goal of this research paper is to provide an initial look at motivations for homeschooling in Canada which is informed by the results from U.S. studies. The basic interview schedule contained questions about: 1) parent&#65533;s motives for homeschooling; 2) how they arrived at the decision to homeschool; 3) how they actually accomplish homeschooling on a daily basis; 4) what are their perceptions of various aspects of the educational system; 5) what are their thoughts about parental and state rights and responsibilities for education. As other topics arose, they were pursued with alternatives lines of questioning. 1) Characteristics of Homeschooling Parents Some of the parents interviewed had not completed high school while others had post-graduate degrees.</paragraph><paragraph parID="116">The vast majority had completed high school and had some post-secondary education. None of the parents were currently employed as teachers, although four had degrees in education. All of the families knew of at least one family that was currently homeschooling where one or both parents were teachers. Virtually all of the families lived on one income. There was also diversity in the length of time that families had been homeschooling. Thirteen families had only started homeschooling within the last four years, while the rest had homeschooled for longer periods. Almost all of the homeschoolers expressed a strong spiritual or religious commitment, however, this was not a major motivation for homeschooling for most of them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">2) Coming to the decision to homeschool For most participants in this study, the decision to homeschool was not precipitated by a specific incident. Many parents arrived at the decision gradually over a period of months or years. The process usually started with a general dissatisfaction with elements of the public school which led to an investigation of alternatives, usually private school. For people who had begun homeschooling more than four years ago, they did not know that homeschooling was out there as an option. In several cases parents had decided to homeschool their children before they even attended school. This was almost exclusive among those families who had begun homeschooling less than four years ago. 3) Motivations for homeschooling Only two people in this research made a specific connection between bad personal experiences at school and their decision to homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">Negative memories of school do not appear to be a major motivation for homeschooling among Canadian parents. Canadian homeschoolers do not appear to differentiate as clearly between ideological and pedagogical objections to schooling as homeschoolers in the U.S. Most families felt that the overall environment of schools was detrimental to their childrens&#65533; well-being. Parents may have taken their children out of school initially due to a poor school environment, low academic standards or moral and religious concerns, however, parents found there were positive changes in their children as well. Homeschooling had helped strengthen the family bond&#65533;both parents and children were happier and more comfortable around each other. Family unity was an unexpected benefit of the practice, and not an initial motivation. With respects to whether the state or parents should have the right to determine a child&#65533;s education, some parents who had started homeschooling recently were confused by the question. They felt that it was their right and responsibility to look out for their children and the state had the right and responsibility to protect the well-being of everyone.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">For those parents who had been homeschooling for longer than four years, they felt that they had the right to determine their children&#65533;s education and that homeschooling helped them to manifest that right. Some parents felt strongly that homeschooling was part of living an alternative lifestyle. These parents&#65533;some new to homeschooling and others who were veterans&#65533;felt that homeschooling meshed nicely with their other values including a belief in herbal medicines, vegetarianism, concern for the environment and social justice. However, the majority of parents did not feel that homeschooling was an integral component of living an alternative lifestyle. They felt that they were normal in all respects, except for the fact that their children did not go to school. 4) Attitudes towards the public education system Parents in the study did not uniformly object to public education, but rather to specific parts of the system. Not all homeschooling parents felt that homeschooling was a better option than public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">Some felt that public school is preferable to homeschooling if it is done properly. Many homeschoolers actually have quite favourable opinions of certain aspects of public education. Teachers: Some parents in the study had pulled their children out of school due to problems with a specific teacher, however, most parents had favourable impressions of teachers as a group. Most parents recognized that there were good and bad teachers. Many parents had a high degree of respect for teachers and felt that they were caring, well-meaning and doing their best under the circumstances. Of course, not all parents were positive about teachers and were quite negative about their unions. Local school officials: Principals and school board trustees received a more mixed review from parents in the study.</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">Some homeschoolers were positive about principals at their local schools while others told &#65533;horror stories&#65533; of how badly they were treated. Some principals were quite supportive of the homeschooling decision while others tried to block attempts by parents to homeschool their children. Discussion As more and more people take up homeschooling, their reasons for doing so may have changed. The results presented above suggest that motivations for homeschooling have changed in recent years. The families interviewed expressed both ideological and pedagogical reasons for homeschooling. Families had problems with both the content of public school curricula as well as how it was being delivered. There were also concerns over the social issues in schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">Family unity was a result of homeschooling and not the reason to start homeschooling in the first place. An important shift has occurred in the homeschooling movement. Today, homeschooling is being considered a more legitimate option than in the past. More and more parents view homeschooling as merely one educational option among many rather than a radical alternative to contemporary public schooling. This would suggest that homeschooling is appealing to a larger, more &#65533;mainstream&#65533; segment of the population than in the past. That is why homeschoolers in this study cannot be separated easily into ideologues and pedagogues. Parents are more interested in trying to do what is best for their children, rather than using their educational choices to make deliberate political statements about parental rights in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">Homeschooling will likely continue to increase in popularity and will be strengthened as more and more mainstream parents choose this educational option. However, the growth of homeschooling is limited by two important considerations. First, homeschooling is usually only possible when one of two parents, or a single parent, is able to stay home with the children. Both the single income family and the single, non-employed parent family are becoming less common in Canada. This puts a limit on the number of potential homeschooling families. The second limitation is the type and amount of time and effort required to educate children at home. There are many people who would not want to teach their children at home even if the family environment would allow it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="124">However, despite these two limitations, homeschooling will likely grow substantially for an extended period of time. Another implication of the mainstreaming of homeschooling is better cooperation between schools and the home. In the past, homeschoolers preferred to have little or no contact with school officials. Most contact was initiated by the schools and most of the efforts were aimed at trying to get children back into the school system. However, as a new generation of parents take up homeschooling they may demand more interaction and cooperation from schools. Parents may begin to initiate contact and demand that schools work with and support them in their efforts to educate their children at home. School officials may also be more amenable to cooperation with homeschoolers because they will realize that homeschooling is not a wholesale rejection of the public education system.</paragraph><paragraph parID="125">Homeschooling is now being viewed by some parents as simply an alternative and possibly a complementary education option. This increased contact may lead to a blurring of boundaries between homeschooled and schooled children and the boundaries between home and school. Bruce Arai teaches courses in research methods, statistics, and the sociology of work at Wilfrid Laurier University. His research interests include homeschooling, educational assessment, and economic sociology, particularly self-employment. Professor Arai homeschools his children.

The anti-homeschooling brigade doesn't know the good stuff; homeschoolers don't want to scare you off with any hint of difficulty, and anyway we're so sick of all the criticism we have to field from civilians that many of us are in Persistent Cheerleading Mode when it comes to the subject of homeschooling. By Carol Narigon, HEM J/F 05. Deschooling Our Lives by Matt Hern (Editor) A provocative, practical response to the crisis in our schools, this book argues boldly for replacing compulsory schooling with a wide variety of home, neighborhood, and community-based educational efforts. Because of this, every state defines homeschooling differently and has different requirements for home schooled children including any parents acting as teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="129">The Home School Legal Defense Association provides information about each state's home school laws. A homeschooling curriculum should be based on the child's age, learning style and the chosen instruction method. The most important aspect of developing a home school curriculum is for it to be realistic. Homeschooling your children can lead to some unanswered questions for parents and if they are not fully prepared. Fortunately, it is not difficult to find information about how to home school or to implement homeschooling methods and a curriculum. The Internet is one of the best resources for homeschooling including how-to information. Online, parents can find support groups and associations, curriculums, lesson plans and the laws concerning homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="130">When incorporated into a curriculum, the Internet can serve as a resource tool, instruction medium or a way to connect children with a classroom. This article provides novice and experienced parents with information and additional sources on how to homeschool. Identifying Requirements Laws on education are established and administered individually by each state. The majority of states do not require homeschooling parents to be certified teachers, and a few do not even require parents to have a high school diploma to teach their children. The Association operates an interactive website through which users can determine their particular state's laws. Additionally, many states have homeschooling associations which provide this same information.</paragraph><paragraph parID="131">Materials You'll Need The materials required to home school a child depend on the selected teaching method, subject and child's age. Curriculums for each subject must also be developed or bought. Other materials include workbooks, craft supplies or textbooks. If the chosen method uses television or the Internet, DVD's and software may also need to be purchased. Fortunately, many curriculums and lesson plans and other materials are offered online for free. New materials are also sold, and sometimes used materials are sold for a discount.</paragraph><paragraph parID="132">Lessons should be able to be completed in a reasonable time and conform to the child's current mental development. If a curriculum satisfies both of these aspects, it is likely that the child will learn what is intended to be taught and that neither the parent or child will become worn-out by the schooling.

I'll only be doing this until things get better.</paragraph><paragraph parID="136">Looking for Homeschooling Information? When I look at homeschooling books and websites, I'm struck by homeschoolers' passion and conviction. While this is generally a good thing, it can be off-putting to parents who are considering homeschooling. " Unlike all the homeschooling articles and websites that I read, I am not sure that homeschooling is a great idea. Time4Learning receives a lot of phone calls and emails from parents who feel this way. Elise's story epitomizes the reality that many start down the homeschool path somewhat accidentally.

The reasons for choosing to homeschool a child can be so varied, but in many cases, parents put their children in schools and had no thoughts or intentions to homeschool. After some problems in schools and maybe a school switch or two, some of the parents consider homeschooling as the best approach for their children. These " accidental homeschoolers " usually come to homeschooling somewhat later, and not necessarily out of choice.

A Home Education : A reference point for information on home schooling. It offers articles on a number of questions related to the issues impacting home education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">Imparting education to children (by parents or private tutors) at home and out of the formal setting of schools is known as homeschooling. Formal schooling in its present form has only been around since the early 19th century. One of the earliest and most influential critics of the western formal education/schooling system, John Holt, advocated homeschooling, " I want to make it clear that I don't see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools. I think that the home is the proper base for the exploration of the world which we call learning or education. Time 4 Learning : A comprehensive guide to homeschooling from the reasons of homeschooling, to the mechanics of it and the associated challenges. Legal Status of Home Schooling Most countries have compulsory education laws requiring parents to provide their children with recommended levels of education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">These laws make many parents believe that schooling can only be done through formal schools and home schooling may be against the law. However, homeschooling is considered a legitimate and legal option in most countries. Parents need to follow certain guidelines and file relevant documentation with the authorities to show that their children are receiving a satisfactory level of education. Advantages and Disadvantages of Homeschooling Parents can spend more quality time with their children and develop a better understanding of their individual needs. Children don&#65533;t need to alter their pace of learning based on the capabilities of other kids. Children don&#65533;t have to deal with a one-size-fits-all teaching style because parents can customize it according to the child&#65533;s needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">Homeschooled children don&#65533;t have to give in to peer-pressure, which can often be traumatizing. Parents are completely responsible for all aspects of the child&#65533;s education, which can be quite stressful. If something goes wrong, there is no one else to blame but you. Homeschooled children are always around so parents may feel that they don&#65533;t have time for themselves. Children may feel alienated because their life doesn&#65533;t fit in with the mainstream student population and they may have difficulty relating to them. Children may not have all of the tools and facilities available at home as compared to schools. Parents have to work extra hard on maintaining a proper social life for the children which involves arranging activities and gatherings with other homeschooled kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="142">In most cases children love the idea of not going to school, but the parents may have to deal with some of their reservations. Parents also need to be entirely convinced of the idea of homeschooling because it often meets stiff resistance from the family, friends etc. If you decide to quit after a while, it could really cause problems for the child If you have thought it out and are certain that homeschooling is the way to go, this is what you will need to do. Set clear goals: You need to clearly identify the goals you wish to achieve from homeschooling your children. Choice of a Curriculum: The parents, who are new to homeschooling, often find it daunting and confusing to choose a curriculum. A common misunderstanding is that they have to use a complete package just like in schools but that is not the case.</paragraph><paragraph parID="143">Parent Guide to Homeschooling : A nice collection of articles on various aspects of homeschooling. You don&#65533;t necessarily need to subscribe to any specific approach; you can use trial and error to figure out the best approach for you and your child. A good thing about home schooling is that the parents can modify approaches as and when needed. Textbook approach : This is a systematic and sequential approach which is commonly used in formal schools. It suits the students who are methodical learners and like a routine, and the teachers who like to proceed step-by-step. Unit study approach : This approach is in contrast with the textbook approach because it concentrates on a particular topic or theme in an integrated way over a period of time. It combines different subjects around one theme and teaches with the help of text, activities and other fun learning ways.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">Classical method : This method is also called Trivium which is divided into three parts according to the child&#65533;s development.

Home Schooling Today : Learn about the pros and cons of home schooling along with articles on other aspects of home schooling. While home schooling gives parents considerable freedom to choose the best way to educate their children, they still need to monitor the progress and evaluate the children. The decision to homeschool is a personal one and can be a difficult one. Homeschooling families set their own schedules and can choose when to begin and end their school year. Back to School is an exciting time for us.</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">The summer is winding down and we are looking forward to our days having a little more structure to them. Parents have the control over their children and their learning experience. The Learning Experience Another advantage of homeschooling is the fact that with this type of education, the child or children learn at his or her own pace. They can take all the time they need to work out a complicated math problem, or learn a particular subject. With the public school system, everything focuses on a time schedule. A child must move on in any particular subject even when they do not have the understanding of the material.</paragraph><paragraph parID="146">In the homeschooling environment, a child does not have to rush to put the math book away to hurry over to social studies or government class. This kind of situation can be frustrating, bringing about the feeling of inadequacy and lower self-esteem, because they are having trouble keeping up in class or in mastering their school assignments. Homeschooling avoids these situations by allowing the child to move on when they are ready and when they fully understand a particular subject matter. It is perfectly okay if a student needs more time to master a subject matter in homeschooling. It used to be that only the rich and famous homeschooled their children, but not anymore. This form of education is recognized and accepted throughout the United States. The only requirement to get started is that parents must follow state regulations when teaching their children at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">Advantages of Learning at Home : Information on this link is geared toward Christian homes, showing that homeschooling can balance out the faith and religious aspect of family life as well as keeping the focus on education and learning.

The learning experience is focused, scheduled and managed around the family. Many advantages of homeschooling benefit both parent and child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">However, the most important factor of all is the parents, because they are the teachers behind effective homeschooling. Homeschooling: The Benefit of Personalized Schedules Educating your child or children at home has many advantages. One advantage that parents consider when thinking of this form of education is the flexibility of creating a personalized teaching schedule, one that will benefit both parent and child. In public schools, the school day starts promptly at 8:30; however, for homeschooling, the school day can begin at 10 o clock, letting the personalized time schedule be more in tune with your family. Having a personalized schedule will allow your child to learn when they want to and for as long as they want to. No more mandatory 50-minute lesson plans.</paragraph><paragraph parID="150">Perhaps your child wants to spend more time in English class and less time in Science. With homeschooling, personalized time schedules cater to the child wants and needs. The school day can be several hours per day as opposed to 8 hours of mandatory academic study. However, with homeschooling, education can go outside the classroom to include the environment and the community. With the parent as the educator, a child gets a more rounded education with hands on learning and experience that will complement their book learning. You can balance out the learning experience by including both principles into the curriculum. Educating a child at home means that if a parent wants to instill religious values and morals they can do so without opposition from a principal, a superintendent or a school board.</paragraph><paragraph parID="151">A homeschooled child can uphold their religious beliefs while studying academics. With prayer being removed from the public school system, parents of homeschoolers can start their school day in prayer without the worry of offending anyone, if this is what they opt to do. Homeschooling Opens Doors for Other Interest Due to budget cuts within the public school systems, many school activities are obsolete or do not exist anymore. However, with homeschooling, if a child shows some interest in music, dance, art or cooking, a teaching parent can add these interests to the curriculum as part of the child's education or school day. A homeschooled student can have the opportunity to expand their mind in areas of study that the public or private school systems do not offer. There is not a subject matter or an educational activity that cannot be sought when exploring the avenues of opportunity in homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="152">There are no limitations in homeschooling, for the sky is the limit when a child shows interest in a particular area. The parent can make sure that the interest is part of the curriculum. Focus Around the Family Another advantage of homeschooling is the fact that this avenue of education is not centered on an overcrowded classroom. There are no classroom disruptions from unruly students. Teaching a child or children at home becomes more personal as opposed to a public or private school where teachers contend with 10-15 or more students per class on a daily basis. Homeschooling brings about a one on one teaching experience for parent and child or children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="153">The student or students get the personalized attention that they need if they are having difficulty in certain academic studies or school activities. They do not have to compete for the teacher's time and attention in a homeschooled setting. With the homeschooling environment, the classroom focus is also on the family, regardless of how many children are taught at home or their ages. It becomes a family thing when doing activities and educational outings. Everyone becomes involved with the experience. Teaching a child or children at home means there will be less bullying to contend with and no metal detectors to have to walk through as they start their school day. The Absence of Peer Pressure</paragraph><paragraph parID="154">A child taught at home may have less problems and worries about dealing with peer pressure and socialization issues. Today in the public school sector, the norm is for everyone to look and dress the same, wearing school uniforms to put everyone at ease as far as status is concern. To look at a uniformed student, you cannot tell if they are from the middle class, the elite or if they come from a poor background. However, in reality, it takes more than a uniform to make a student feel accepted and comfortable in their environment, especially if they are different mentally, emotionally or physically. With the public and private school systems, parents tend to worry about all the negative influence that their child may encounter while socializing in their peer groups. Being educated at home sets a firm foundation of self-esteem, values and moral integrity, a foundation built and regulated by the parent and not by peers or the public school system. It also list more advantages to teaching your child at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="155">The Pros of Homeschooling : This article shows the benefits of homeschooling, comparing and giving examples of the differences between public schools and homeschooling. An Excellent Reason for Homeschooling Another Reason for Homeschooling A shocked grandmother shares another excellent reason for homeschooling... Incredibly, the public school system has tested her and declared her a COMPETENT 6th grade student. Please, anyone who is having doubts, HOMESCHOOL your students if you want them to have an education. You need no special training, if you can read, add and subtract you can do a better job than the public schools are doing!!</paragraph><paragraph parID="156">I believe the main reason is that the public school system has failed us. One of the reasons I homeschool is not only the failure of the public school system, but because I feel it is up to us the parents to teach OUR children! Homeschooling at home has given us quality time with our children to train and influence them in all areas in an integrated way. Each child receives individual attention and his/her needs are met accordingly... for each child is unique! Children also gain a respect for their elders, as well as inter-relate with them. The family experiences unity, closeness and enjoyment of one another! We have been able to teach our children moral values, and how to walk in the spirit of God.</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">Why Homeschool? Many parents are committed to educating their children at home. With each parent there is a specific reason why! She also outlines her options to address the problems, one of which is homeschooling about which she says: "I'm realizing the root of my resistance might be deeper as it would also alter my life dramatically (insert selfish feelings here)." Nine readers have responded to date, several of whom offer good thoughts on homeschooling's benefits and urge a second look at the practice. After the reader states she could have written the same "school troubles" post, she writes, "I can see we're losing him and his thirst for learning, and that's terrifying. "I am very worried for the years to come.</paragraph><paragraph parID="158">believed that they could give their child a better education at home had religious reasons thought that their children had a poor learning enviornment at school had family reasons wanted to develop character and morality objected to what schools teach thought that their school wasn't challenging their child</paragraph><paragraph parID="159">Other common reasons are that their child has special needs or disabilities or that he or she was having behavior problems at school. And even though they might spend less time with other children that are their same age, studies show that homeschooled kids often have better social adjustment than kids who go to school. At least one homeschooling association is active in every state. These groups offer advice and information and hold conferences at which families who school at home discuss legal, philosophical, and teaching issues. Parents can also find guidance in web sites, message forums, books, magazines, and newsletters. Learning never stops when you homeschool . In homeschooling I can help to guide them and set an example.</paragraph><paragraph parID="160">I want my children to have confidence and belief in themselves and a homeschool provides an ideal environment for this. One of the benefits of homeschooling is that I can give my children the gift of time to explore their passion . I believe we are here to use and enjoy our talents and homeschooling gives me the opportunity to encourage my children to revel in the things that capture their imagination. Homeschooling gives them the time and space to just be. - I am saying that the opportunity for these benefits present themselves when we are homeschooling - and it is up to us to nurture and embrace them. My Top Ten Reasons for Homeschooling I usually keep my answer simple, but I find in reality there are many homeschooling benefits .</paragraph><paragraph parID="161">Here are my top ten: Ten Benefits of Homeschooling Surprisingly this is the least mentioned of 'objections' people raise when talking about my reasons for homeschooling. Yet I am constantly amazed and the scope and depth of the things we have learned (and I feel we have only just scratched the surface!) Education can be not only tailored to the children's interests but also 'real life' education can take a major part (cooking, book-keeping, organising a party!) By keeping learning fresh and interesting I can develop in my children a deep curiosity and desire to know and understand the world around them. From standing in line.</paragraph><paragraph parID="162">From asking permission to visit the bathroom or have a drink. And most importantly from restrictive time constraints. We have the time to investigate an interesting subject in depth . We have the time to stop and watch a caterpillar eat its way across a leaf. And we have the time to close our books and visit a museum - just because. We also have the flexibility to work learning into our life whatever else is happening. Family and love</paragraph><paragraph parID="163">Although there are proponents of 'quality time, not quantity' I wholeheartedly disagree with them! A family is as strong as the time it spends together. In eating, playing, learning and laughing together we are building a bond that is strong and durable . My children are protected in a warm and loving environment, which will give them a secure base when they venture out on their own. Morals and Values When she first heard we were to homeschool my horrified mother-in-law exclaimed "Its not just their education - it's their whole moral upbringing!" I don't want my children to be taught their morals from someone I don't know well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="164">And I certainly don't want their values to be gleaned from a group of equally young and inexperienced children. I want my children to know who they are - and to value their own self-worth. And for that I feel they need to be given the space to experiment without condemnation. My children have no concept of 'designer labels'. They don't measure people by which trainers they wear. They feel entitled to have their own opinions and to state them. How can children learn to operate in society when they are not a part of it ?</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">My children meet everybody - rich, poor, young, old, quiet or loud. Their social spectrum is not confined to 20 children the same age as them. They can converse with all sorts of people. My children glow! Not chained to desks all day, they are out in the sun and are strong from climbing and running. I can keep a check on their diet and make sure they are getting enough water to drink. But more importantly they have a joy about life that keeps them stress-free and with a healthy immune system .</paragraph><paragraph parID="166">Isn't that a great reason? Remember when you wanted to learn all you could about it, or work at it for days at a time. A passionless existence is a dreary one. But many of us try to squeeze in the things we are passionate about in small chunks of time instead of making them a major part of our lives. My daughter taught me a huge lesson about creativity which I cover in my article Homeschooling Crafts . Childhood is a fleeting thing, and I want my children to enjoy it. I am not saying that we have ALL these benefits of homeschooling ALL the time (boy, would I be insufferable!!)</paragraph><paragraph parID="167">Deciding whether to homeschool? It is a big decision, and there is lots to think about. Make sure you are clear about the pros and cons of homeschooling . Oh my goodness! Thank you so much. I found your website, and finally I have the confidence to take the plunge and take my daughter out of school and educate her at home, thank you, thank you. Marina (UK) I cannot get over how much great information and super ideas you have here.</paragraph><paragraph parID="168">Fantastic! Among common reasons that were cited in a National Center for Education Statistics study were that parents: A large number of homeschoolers who have taken state-mandated tests or who have provided their results to researchers actually have above average test results. They also have above average test results on the ACT and SAT college entrance exams. By most estimates, about 1 million students are homeschooled in the United States each year. Why do parents choose to homeschool their kids? Unless you have some training though, these last two reasons might not be a good reason to homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">Children with special needs or with behavior problems might be able to help at school from specially trained professionals. Surprisingly, homeschoolers distribute over the grade groupings in much the same way as nonhomeschoolers. This means that there is the same percentage of 1st graders being homeschooled as high schoolers. I had always thought that parents usually homeschooled their younger children and then often sent them to school when they got older. Some other characteristics of homeschoolers: 75% are white, non-Hispanic, while only 65% of nonhomeschoolers are white. many come from families with 3 or more children</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">97% of homeschooling parents were married couples. This isn't surprising, since in a single parent home, that parent usually has to work outside the home the household income of homeschoolers, reported in ranges from less than $25,000 to over $75,000, is the same as the household income of nonhomeschoolers But Isn't Homeschooling Bad? Of course not. Many homeschooled kids participate in homeschool support groups, scouting, church and recreational activities, and other associations. How To Get Started with Homeschooling</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">To get started, most homeschooling families join local support groups. Families often find these groups by word of mouth or through public or private schools, religious groups, or state or national associations. Some school districts have established centers at which families may enroll in classes or obtain resources and instructional support. Such arrangements are called shared schooling, dual enrollment, or assisted homeschooling. Some districts also allow homeschoolers to attend public school part-time. Many private schools, some public schools, and the state of Alaska provide homeschoolers with texts, materials, and support. Homeschoolers also rely on libraries, museums, parks department programs, churches, civic associations, and other local institutions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="172">Is Homeschooling for Everyone? No. Homeschooling is hard work. It can also be expensive, as you have to pay for educational materials and extracurricular activities. You may also be faced with a loss of income if one parent has to quit a job to homeschool. When homeschooling, your family will experience increased time together, much more than regular families. Homeschooling makes you to prioritize your values, often causing you to realize, or remember what truly matters in life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">Homeschooling can also help your family start to appreciate and find enjoyment in life's simple pleasures - like taking a walk together or watching ants work tirelessly, as they care for their colony. Consider the Pros and Cons of Homeschooling Taking some time to consider the pros and cons of homeschooling, especially when making a life changing decision like home-based education, demonstrates prudent decision making. Knowing the advantage of homeschooling as well as the disadvantages will help you not only make a good decision, but will minimize any discouragement or negative feelings you may encounter when educating your child at home. Homeschooling is not easy, but it is rewarding! Anyone can homeschool, but homeschooling is definitely not easy. Homeschooling requires commitment, diligence, and at times, perseverance from both you, and your family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">More Family Time... Yay!? This can be a good thing, or a bad thing, I guess... depending on the family member, or if your family doesn't get along with each other. Homeschooling forces your family to: Work together. Get along. Help each other. Overlook differences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">Develop patience and acceptance. ... on a daily basis. Although not easy, family relationship-building, and learning to interact positively with each other, is always a good thing! Enjoy a Simplified Lifestyle! Other pros and cons of homeschooling may be giving up a second income or staying home full time with your children to school them. Most homeschooling families do live on one income, however you will find many opportunities to earn additional income, if needed... sometimes from the comforts of your home! Living on one income may not seem like something you think you can do, especially if you are accustomed to living a certain lifestyle, or enjoying particular luxuries.</paragraph><paragraph parID="176">Downsizing isn't all negative, however. Pros and Cons of Homeschooling Vary Remember, pros and cons will vary depending on your family and your situation. Each family is unique and chooses to homeschool for different reasons. When talking to homeschooling families, you will discover a variety of benefits to homeschooling, depending on the family's values or goals. If you are serious about home education for your family, taking some time to consider the pros and cons of homeschooling, helps you make a wise decision. The Time4learning program is a great way to keep your child interested in learning, and it is especially great for kids who learn best through visual learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="177">Veteran homeschoolers often forget that at first, homeschooling was a solution to a problem; not a lifestyle or philosophical choice. My kids were brought up knowing the difference between right and wrong, but they&#65533;re easily influenced by their peers. Last year I met with both teachers and school administrators about the &#65533;morally casual&#65533; behavior they were picking up in the classroom. Instead of action, my concerns were met with excuses and the typical &#65533;we&#65533;ll look into it&#65533; response, which just wasn&#65533;t enough. Our school&#65533;s budget is tied directly to FCAT scores, so teachers teach to the test but don&#65533;t include the concepts behind the material. My kids are conceptual learners, so every night, I&#65533;d find myself re-teaching what they should have learned in the classroom. Finally, I decided that it would be better (and less stressful for everyone) to do it myself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="178">I pulled my son out of school because he has ADHD complicated by some health issues. His class had 36 students in it, so his teacher spent more time babysitting than teaching. And because the only kids who got attention were the trouble makers, my son started picking up bad habits. My kids can work independently or with my involvement. Homeschooling is on the rise around the state (and the nation), and libraries are serving an increasing number of homeschooling families. Homeschooling parents are committed to providing an excellent environment to learning for their children, and most of them rely heavily on public libraries to help them do so. Homeschoolers are often excellent advocates for the library, a great volunteer base for projects and programs, and they will improve your circulation numbers with their giant stacks of books!</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">Homeschoolers typically use interlibrary loan heavily. Homeschooling in Wisconsin: At Home with Learning (5th Edition) . There are special opportunities and challenges when serving this population, and there are an increasing number of resources available to help. Hopefully, this web page will give you some useful tools as you come up with a plan for serving homeschoolers. Two percent of school aged children in Wisconsin are homeschooled-the number of homeschooled children has increased by 12% since 1999, while the number of kids in public schools has only increased by 1%. There are really as many reasons for homeschooling as there are homeschooling families. Many homeschooling families do so for religious reasons, but many families choose to school at home because they feel their educational philosophy is not supported in a school setting.</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">Others feel they can better meet their children's educational, academic or physical needs better at home, or maintain a healthier and more unified family through homeschooling. Many families homeschool for a combination of the above, and some for reasons not listed. Sometimes homeschoolers are elusive. For a variety of reasons, it can be difficult to reach out to them as a group. Once you find one family you can usually get the word out about your programs and resources to many others. Often there are support or study groups, which can be a great way to promote library resources, including internet access, Badgerlink, programs, and materials. Work with the families to determine what kinds of support they are looking for from the library.</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">Some families are using a curriculum that requires many out-of-print and archaic books. Some libraries have found that they need to place a limit on the number of materials a family can request each week. Families doing unit studies may want to check out everything in your library on a certain topic, and want to keep it for longer. Some libraries give homeschooling parents the same benefits that they give to school teachers, including a longer loan period. Most families will be very receptive to limits that will ensure that some materials about a topic are still available to other library users. If your library is a member of one of the shared systems, you may find that this is less of an issue, as families can find many materials at other libraries as well. According to information on various homeschooling websites, one thing that homeschoolers most wish for from libraries is a resource file.</paragraph><paragraph parID="182">The file could include contact information about local homeschool groups, information about the Wisconsin state law, information about the Wisconsin Parents Association, and other local resources. Providing space for displaying artwork, a bulletin board for homeschoolers to communicate with each other, and space for playgroups and classes are easy ways to accommodate the needs of this group. Though most homeschoolers do not expect libraries to provide a packaged curriculum, they do hope for materials that will support their curriculum, including general books and magazines about homeschooling(see attached list), unabridged books on tape, nonfiction videos, and other basic elements of a library collection. Many homeschooling families are active participants in library programming for the general public. Multi-age, family-oriented programs are often very well received. If the homeschoolers in your area are interested, you may want to offer some tours and instructional workshops about the OPAC and other resources and databases. The library could organize a curriculum swap, where people can sell or trade their materials with each other.</paragraph><paragraph parID="183">One of the most important things you can give homeschoolers is respect for their choices. Providing them with excellent service is one way of doing that. If all this sounds like a lot of work, you will find that the payoff in great library supporters, increased circulation, and some really wonderful children is well worth the effort. Below, you will find a bibliography of general homeschooling books and magazines, as well as websites that deal with homeschooling.

American Homeschool Association www.americanhomeschoolassociation.org This site contains many well-organized pages on practical and philosophical topics. Homeschooling parents should not need to prove they are innocent of abusing their children as a condition for freely exercising their parental rights in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="184">Homeschooling and Child Abuse: A Response to Recent Media Reports In recent months, homeschooling has received a double whammy in major media outlets. CBS Evening News presented a two-part segment titled "The Dark Side of Homeschooling" (Oct. 13 and 14, 2003). The New York Times published an editorial headlined "Make Homeschooling Safe for Children" (Nov. 15, 2003). The CBS report presented cases of child abuse in homeschooling families, focusing on the murder-suicide of three children in North Carolina. The Times editorial highlighted the near starvation of adopted foster children in New Jersey. Both CBS and The Times called for greater regulation of homeschooling to protect children from potential abuse. The media reports concluded that the abuse in these cases was connected to homeschooling, even though they offered no studies or data to show that homeschooled children are more likely to be abused than children attending school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">Therefore, they were not hidden, and the assertion that families use homeschooling to hide abuse is an unproven theory. Since social services had already been notified by sources in the community, and had already observed the conditions in the homes on more than one occasion, it is highly unlikely that increased homeschooling regulation would have protected these children. Why did reputable news organizations like CBS and The Times, in their editorializing about the issue, choose to exclude well-known and extremely pertinent facts about the cases in New Jersey and North Carolina? Had these relevant facts been included, the sensationalistic leap that these families were "hiding," and the subsequent allegation that all homeschooling children may be in danger, could not have been made. At some point, we may face challenges to our homeschooling freedoms, and legislation or suggestions of legislation intended to address the issue of preventing child abusers from using homeschooling as a cover. Here are points to consider regarding what is sure to be an ongoing discussion in the media, our personal lives, and the legal arena. Don't muddy the issues First and foremost, homeschooling and child abuse are separate issues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">Any regulation specifically focusing on preventing child abuse among homeschoolers would ignore the fact that child abuse occurs in the general population, not just in the homeschooling population. Background checks, home visits, and other invasions of privacy have been suggested as forms of regulation. The right to homeschool is recognized by every state in the country. The vast majority of parents act in the best interest of their children, an assertion with which the US Supreme Court agrees. Home visits to check for evidence of abuse would require school officials to act in a capacity for which they do not have the legal authority or training. And while teachers and school administrators are mandated reporters, too, this doesn't stop abuse of school children now, leaving no reason to believe that giving school officials increased oversight would prevent abuse of homeschooled children. Legislation based on hypothetical and rare abuse situations would be bad law, putting financial and other burdens on states, schools, and social service agencies, and violating the rights and privacy of homeschooling families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">It is also inextricably linked to the important question of who benefits from increased regulation of homeschooling. Homeschooling has become a well-established, successful, and viable educational option. In the face of satisfactory standardized test scores, the welcoming of homeschooled students by colleges and universities, and the presence of homeschoolers in community organizations of every kind, these arguments fall flat. A few factors: - continual threat of teachers' strikes, with both sides using the kids as pawns - increasing class sizes and cuts to funding - some moral issues with the curriculum - long school bus rides (45 min each way for a 4.5 year old?) - having eliminated the public school option, we looked at private school and decided we could to as good a job for a lot less than the tuition costs! - having a sister whose boys were HSed and whose education was very impressive - the realization after our first 'trial year' that we loved it, loved learning with our kids and spending time with them, and the fact that academically they were allowed to excel in their best subjects and get one-on-one attention in the weaker areas - seeing how our middle daughter has learned by 'osmosis' - just hearing her older sister's lessons has benefited her - I'm selfish! I wanted to be with her and I enjoyed the learning we had done together.</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">As I checked out schools, read and volunteered, I became convinced that I could do a better job teaching her than any teacher she would run into in the school system where we lived. Now, I can see the other great reasons for homeschooling that were not readily apparent to me when I began, twelve years ago. Things like a close, loving family, where my fifteen-year-old daughter not only likes to talk to me, but also still likes to cuddle. Things like my children retaining their innocence and joy of life as well as a good moral foundation. Things like my children being excited about receiving books for Christmas or birthdays, and being really excited about that. Or what about my daughter being really happy because she got to start Algebra this year, which she was really looking forward to because it is "a detective story, except with numbers". Maybe the best thing about homeschooling, for me, was reclaiming my family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">At first we wanted a quality education, and was dissatisfied with the quality and cost of the Christian school we were using. After the first year we continued because of the results that we saw. The kids were no longer stressed. They were happy and liked learning again. Our family drew closer together. They far exceeded academically what they were doing in the Christian school though they had been good students. They love homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">They stopped bickering and fighting frequently. We could quickly cover the stuff that was too boring and could slow down and expand the areas that caught their attention. Many of the things they used to think boring (history, science) they like because of the involved approach we use. They are able to take many more courses and have many more learning experiences than in a traditional school. Families choose to homeschool for many different reasons. The decision to homeschool is a personal one and usually a difficult one. I have my daughter back.</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">Our family feels whole again. This is where she belongs. No one is going to care for her the way we do. She's is so much happier now. She has the energy to pursue her interests and discover her talent. My gratitude overflows for all those who have made this so easy for me, from the true pioneers of homeschool education, to those who are so generous in sharing their experiences and knowledge in the homeschool community and especially this site. May your decision to homeschool be a rewarding experience for you and your family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="192">-Bad school experiences: my son is 5.5. Besides, it's our responsibility to ensure our kids learn our religion, and I can do this best when son is not missing for 35 hours/week. In that two weeks, my son has become more relaxed, more willing to listen, kinder to his sister, and more open to affection from us. He has overheard our conversations about hsing, and told us that he wants to be homeschooled. There are many creative ways to tackle unfamiliar or difficult subjects. There are companies specializing in outstanding learning materials for homeschoolers. Some homeschoolers collaborate with other families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">Another parent might have the strength you lack or you can jointly hire a tutor. Some use community resources&#151;people, programs, and places. You can always jump in alongside your children and learn with them. What a great life lesson for kids if they learn that learning is lifelong. There is a whole spectrum of curriculum resources available to homeschoolers. New products are being developed all the time. There are also resources to help you decide what to teach and when to teach it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">Public schools require testing, but enrollment in public school does not guarantee that any learning is taking place. We have compulsory attendance not compulsory education laws. In states where testing is required of homeschoolers, they usually score in the 80th percentile or above. The validity of standardized tests has been questioned by many educators and researchers. Because they are multiple-choice, they don't measure the ability to think or create. Many critics call for replacing standardized testing with "performance assessments." Families are homeschooling legally in all fifty states.</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">What homeschooling options are available in California? There are four options: establishing your own home as a private school, enrolling in a PSP (a private school that offers independent study), using a public school independent study program or charter school that caters to homeschoolers or, if you have a credential, using the tutorial option. There is a whole continuum of homeschooling approaches from something that resembles the structured school classroom to supporting children in pursuing their own interests. It is most typical for parents to combine homeschooling approaches. They might use a textbook for math, a unit study approach combining history, language arts and the social sciences, and a very hands-on approach to science. There is no typical day. You might be home and crack the books or play games.</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">You might race off to a support group activity. You may take a walk, play some basketball, go grocery shopping or just read a good book. Some parents do a little of each subject every day. Others spend one day on math, another on language arts, and so on. Some families use a planned curriculum and others utilize the library and follow the interests of their children. It is as expensive as your family wants to make it. Some parents spend thousands of dollars a year investing in complete packaged curriculums accompanied by video instruction.</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">Other families pay almost nothing by using the library and everyday activities like cooking, gardening or a home business as the foundation of instruction, especially in the elementary years. A decade ago everyone homeschooled for less because there were very few publications, curricula or conferences for homeschoolers. Now there are more products and services. Are there bad days? Studies have shown that homeschooled children have fewer behavioral problems than their institutionally-schooled peers. Many families, in fact, are able to recognize and more readily remedy true behavioral situations in a much more timely and effective manner. In the long run, you'll have fewer bad days if you homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">How do people get started? Does homeschooling provide the same diversity found in public schools? We are an inclusive group which means we serve families that choose all homeschooling styles and from all religious and ethnic affiliations. We are an organization of energetic and dedicated homeschooling families working to preserve our own educational freedom. We also inform and empower homeschooling families, educate the public, and foster community among home educators in the state of California. We are also the only group that makes it clear that, while we support all homeschooling families and the options they choose, we are dedicating our resources to preserving the freedom to homeschool independent of government intervention or regulation. It is about families loving and learning from one another.</paragraph><paragraph parID="199">Why do families choose to homeschool? There are many reasons families choose to homeschool. Academic excellence, physical safety and the desire to pass on the family's governing values to the children are perhaps the most commonly voiced. Families desire the increased closeness homeschooling brings. Homeschooling maintains the enthusiasm for learning that a child is born with. Homeschooling allows each child to receive individual attention, taking into consideration his own learning style and interests. There are probably as many reasons or combinations of reasons for homeschooling as there are families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">Yes! Americans of different races, socioeconomic backgrounds, and religions homeschool, and they regularly meet with each other at park days throughout the state. Homeschooled children also have the opportunity to be out in their community more often, where they meet and observe many different people. Homeschooling creates a healthy competition between itself and public schools by giving parents another choice in educating their children. There are homeschool support groups, community activities like sports or scouts, specialty classes in music, and after-school play with public schooled friends. Because they have continual interaction and modeling from adults, homeschooled children are less peer-dependent and more comfortable with all age groups than their public school counterparts. The homeschool social world is generally less influenced from the worrisome influences of drugs, gangs, sexual pressures, and violence.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">Homeschooled children test above average regardless of income, race or parent's level of education. One significant achievement of homeschooled children is that the National Merit Scholarship Corporation has chosen significant numbers of homeschooled high school seniors as semifinalists. Homeschoolers have frequently been the winners in spelling bees and other national events. A growing number of colleges and universities around the United States are admitting homeschoolers including prestigious universities like Harvard and Yale. Families from all walks of life and all educational backgrounds are homeschooling successfully. That is because homeschooling, no matter what your approach is, rarely looks like school. When you are homeschooling everything you do turns into an educational opportunity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="202">Homeschooling groups abound and you need not worry about a lack of social opportunities for your child. We also joined a homeschool charter school which hosts activities, occasional classes, and provides curriculum help and materials. Most homeschoolers avail themselves of a variety of classes to round out the education. A few moms of K-aged children in our homeschool group have formed a coop. Every Friday we gather the kids at one house, two moms have the morning off and two moms run a day centered on a theme such as dinosaurs, or apples, space, whatever. Nightly homework, behavior issues, social concerns, negative behaviors the kids pick up at school, negative attitudes towards learning, trying to get an education that fits a kid who has learning disabilities, who is gifted, or both, or otherwise special. When the kids got tired of drawing their organs they helped me sort the contents of the car: books, garbage, recycling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">Many people worry that it will be too demanding and hard on the family. I believe that it actually removes a lot of stresses. School puts a lot of stress on families. Also kids at school are very peer-oriented, while homeschooled kids are family-oriented. I suggest you check out a homeschool group (or several) in your area and see if you like what you see. Because of his unusual education he's more than proficient in some subjects and probably behind in others. Any ideas about high schools/programs (public or private) that would appreciate and support his self-directed in- depth knowledge of computers (he's been the consulting computer tech for all the computer owners in their marina) and other sciences?</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">Re: Troubled daughter has stopped going to school (Jan 2002) For the parent looking for alternative to High School. It cost considerably more but to us is worthwhile to have the structure, advise and guidance. The enrolled student has access to their library a nd their students chat room, besides being able to work on line with other students from different locations. He is bored to tears and is not being nurtured or valued for who he is and what he can bring to the classroom. It is an overcrowded school in an urban area and the teachers seem too stressed to pay attention to the individual needs of their students. The student body is nearly 100% of color and the staff does not reflect his diversity. What's more we are seeing some disturbing subtle behavior/dynamics with staff and the punitive, often antagonistic way they ''deal'' with these children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">I am interested in homeschooling my teenage son, who is 15 and has some school anxiety issues. Student sees Indep Studies Program teacher once a week I think. And teacher can modify workload etc to accommodate outside activities. We have had various recommendation from professionals (psychological testing, residential schools, tough love). Is he being threatened? Is he seriously depressed and doesn't think it's worth the effort? Does he have a substance problem?</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">Is this an ominous sign of new-onset schizophrenia? What about his frustration with a learning problem he doesn't understand? Whatever the answer, it's unlikely to be identified just by homeschooling. He went to several public schools in Marin K-6, but was often under-challenged academically. First, it will give them a chance to relax a bit in the middle ot the week (my 1st grader asks me every day,''Mommy, how many more days until I am off?'') It will give them a chance to catch up on studies from school that they don't quite understand (and are afraid to ask in front of their peers). And it will give them a chance to learn about things that they are interested in and not just what the school thinks that they should learn.</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">Seems a 'civilized' way to raise our children - spend time with them...share our values and interests and let them 'be' just kids some times! I feel that 5 days of school 8:00 - 3:00 is just too long for these little ones to stay focused and productive. Then it's the hectic pace of after school programs, having a family dinner, homework and getting ready for bed. old daughter asked me to teach her how to sew. Well, that's something we could do on a homeschooling day. I am not so sure if any school would support this way of thinking and I am not sure why not. If they truly have our children's best interest at heart then I think the schools should look at each child individually.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">If anyone has any advice on selling this idea to their school please respond. Or if anyone has any other advice about this topic please respond. No stress, no boredom, the best of all worlds. A good way to meet other kids and families is to participate in afternoon sports, art classes, music classes, etc. If the choice is between homeschooling and public, I think the best would be homeschooling. You are right that homeschooling is different for every family. Most families take a while to find out what works best for them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">Homeschooling exists on a continuum from ''School at Home'' where parent and child sit down for several hours a day with a premade curriculum to Unschooling where parents provide an enriched environment and plenty of trips and allow the children to pursue their own interests at their own pace. In my experience most people exist somewhere in the middle of this range, using a mixture of curricula, classes, co-ops, clubs, groups, field trips and free time. In our family we have used online math 3 days/week for several months and then not used it for a while. NCAAHA (Northern CA African-American Homeschool Association) may be a good match for you: http://sites.google.com/site/jhclarkeschool/ncaaha fan of homeschooling Hi, Sorry your son is having this experience. The curriculum is really designed to build on student interests and based on an assessment of individual strengths and needs. If you are planning on going the homeschooling route, I do know that many homeschooling Af. I am leaning towards homeschool, or at the least small class size for my future kindergartener.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">Also, smaller class size doesn't always translate to a better education... Happy Montclair Parent HI I homeschooled at Hickman Charter School - I liked having the homebase office to visit, the staff it upbeat and energetic,like them alot. My daughter had a blast doing carpentry and sewing classes ( better for older kids) the other homeschool programs are not as social and you have to find groups to affiliate with. Homeschool groups welcome people who are considering homeschooling and those with preschool age children who plan to homeschool. http://www.aohl.net/calendar.htm Call Marianne (see page below because the schedule has changed and it is good to let people know you are coming) http://www.homegrownkids.org/parkdayschedule We're a longtime Oakland (formerly Fremont) homeschooling family and new to Hickman. There are many resources in the area for homeschooling. You can find lots of kids to play with, so the common concern about being lonely is not real. I am thinking of homeschooling my son next year (for first grade) and am wondering what experience Berkeley families have had with homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">We are currently in an incredible Montessori program for kindergarden (program is pre-school to 6 years) and are considering homeschooling in addition to our public and private school options. I am planning to attend some Homegrown Kids park-days and am devouring resources on-line but am curious to hear from experienced homeschoolers in the BPN community. Homeschooling Curious A public school homeschooling option is with BUSD's Berkeley Independent Study's (BIS) Home School Program. In the K-8 Home School program, parents/guardians accompany students to weekly 90-minute meetings with teachers. Assignments adhere to state curriculum standards while accommodating students' interests and abilities. BIS provides instructional materials, and tutoring is available.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">Parents/guardians act as home teachers for all of the K-8 lessons. They need to be available to supervise their child's studies at home for 20-25 hours per week. For some students, this program is an excellent alternative to the regular classroom and home teachers can engage in a collaborative approach to learning for their children. Please contact me if you'd like more information. KamalaAsher@berkeley.net 644-4500 ext 14301 Kamala Asher, K-8 Home School Facilitator Are there any homeschooling families with one child out there? I would love some advice as we begin are journey.</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">I am starting to doubt my decision because my picture of homeschooling usually involves a big family. How do you handle the challenges of having just one child at home. please check this out (from a teacher) about things to think about before you homeschool: http://tigerthegecko.blogspot.com/2010/12/home-schooling.html anon I would be happy to discuss our homeschool journey with you. Kim I homeschool my 3 kids, but we have plenty of friends who are homeschooling only children, very successfully I might add. Or let me know if you would like to come to any one of a myriad of homeschool park days that happen all over the Bay Area, where you could chat with all kinds of families on this journey, and I will pass along the times/locations. One thing that keeps coming up for us is the possibility of homeschooling. We have some deep concerns about institutional learning, not to mention the Oakland public schools, and many other reasons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">Homeschooling seems like a real option. I have to admit that on some level I just don't seem to grasp what homeschooling would really be like. I'd love to hear from those of you who homeschool. How structured is your day? What does a typical day look like? Are there things that in hindsight you wished you'd known/thought about? When you total in classes and activities, supplies, etc. what does it really cost?</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">I know there are homeschooling groups out there, but are there any co-ops out there (shared teaching days, shared curriculum)? I'm more looking for a glimpse into what it would actually be like for us. Of course I know that each family is very different, but hoping that any homeschoolers out there could at least give me an idea. We have a math tutor who does math challenges and math circle type problems once per week. We used Saxon math for a few months and Harcourt math for a few months several years ago. We had a Latin club for half a year that turned into a co-op that lasted a year and now Latin continues as a class for the small group of kids who are still interested. We have gone in and out of co-ops over our 7 years of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">We try to travel for 2-8 weeks every year and we don't try to do any ''school'' work during our travel. My kids spend 1 day/week at Trackers outdoor nature clases. One way to see what it is like is by following some local homeschool blogs: These 3 are all Oakland homeschool blogs: Wonder Farm http://patriciazaballos.com Tricia has written a great article on homeschooling that was published in Mothering http://patriciazaballos.com/finally-getting-published/ http://westvistaurbanfarmschool.blogspot.com My own blog: http://homeschoolinginthekitchen.blogspot.com/ Of course, you can always come to park days and chat with moms about what it is really like. Alameda Oakland Home Learners http://www.aohl.net/calendar.htm Home Grown Kids http://www.homegrownkids.org/parkdayschedule SF Bay Area Unschoolers http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SFBUN/ I guess the bottom line is that homeschooling can look like whatever you want it to!</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">There is an email link on my blog if you want to talk further. Susan@Homeschoolinginthekitchen Oakland residents can use hickman charter which offers classes or connecting waters charter which offers more money for materials and classes. The option which offers the most academic freedom is filing a PSA private school affidavit. There are thousands homeschooling in the Bay Area, so the educational and social resources are enormous. We were really concerned that his reading fluency combined with his temperament would result in his disrupting the class, over discipline by the teacher, and resulting low self esteem. Pros of homeschooling: - You can tailor the education to your child's needs - It takes less time to get through a day's lessons - Kids have more time to pursue other interests or just play - No rush in the morning, no homework at night - You set your own schedule, which includes the ability to travel mid-week and off-season - No lost time driving, volunteering, or fundraising - I enjoy the satisfaction that comes with helping my kids grow Cons of homeschooling: - You may not have as much personal time - Substantial loss of my income - Sometimes it's hard to get errands done with kids in tow</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">While I can certainly see some advantages to homeschooling (protecting kids from bad influences, the options of many educational fieldtrips, more individual attention), and the testimonials given by homeschoolers here were interesting &amp;amp; cogent, there are some real drawbacks that should be considered. So, some ideas on how to make sure homeschoolers avoid these problems - and I know many smart, community-building homeschoolers already do these type of things: develop a big network of fellow-homeschoolers, and coordinate large-group classes or playdates. What a glorious suprise to find that it is easy, joyful, rewarding, successful, fun, and the best education I could offer my kids. We originally started homeschooling our son because of his temperament combined with and fluency in reading by age 5. People homeschool for different reasons. We discovered over the past year that homeschooling has brought us closer as a family. Now it's about honoring our family rhythym, having a more relaxed lifestyle.</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">I feel lucky that I am a SAHM and we can spend time together as a family. We don't have to rush out the door every day at 8am; we don't do afterschool activites, then homework, then dinner, then fall into bed exhausted. We can sleep in if we want, stay up late if we want, etc. We do lots of activites, but since my kids don't spend 6 hours a day at school, thei! r days are less crazy. A homeschooler's dirty little secret is that we can go to parks without sharing it with a mob of kids. Museums, pools, parks, libraries, zoos, etc. are quiet and open.</paragraph><paragraph parID="220">Being able to go midweek makes a much more relaxing outing compared to the weekend, for sure. Good websites to check out are: http://homegrownkids.org/ http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/index.htm http://www.hsc.org Almost anyone can homeschool and be successful at it. There are many different styles of homeschooling, and a lot of curriculum to choose from, since homeschooling has become so widespread, especially in this area. You will find a lot of support! My kids are 10 and 7 and have never been to regular school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">They have friends who are homeschoolers and friends who go to regular school. They are very active in community groups, sports, music, and other activities. We take a lot of terrific field trips and classes. You would be welcome at any of the support groups to meet some homeschoolers and ask them questions. Most have weekly park days. If you live in Oakland or Alameda, check out aohl.net. There are also groups in Berkeley, Lamorinda, Hayward, and everywhere else.</paragraph><paragraph parID="222">You can also find books (even at the library) which can give you a basic overview. Feel free to contact me if you have more questions! Jennifer I'd like to give some downside-input about homeschooling, as I saw only upside-input in the recent posts. I'm a fellow mom, educator, &amp;amp; ex-social worker. At the end I will suggest ways homeschoolers can solve the problems I raise. Children need to learn how to relate with many adults, not almost exclusively their mother.</paragraph><paragraph parID="223">The mother relationship is so important, and so loaded, but it should never take the place of most relationships to adults. Parents are naturally not objective about their kids, and kids usual! ly behave worst (at least part of the time) for their primary caregivers. A comment I once heard from a child-development lecturer really struck me as true: ''Your child is not the child you see, she's the child other people see when you are not there. You are there to allow her to fall apart, work feelings out, and let it all hang out.'' So what if you are never not there? And how can you judge how she is doing?</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">Every parent comes from a limited background and education (no matter how brilliant), because she/he is only one person with one perspective. Exposure to many other adults - even a few not- so-great ones - broadens kids' understanding of personalities and cultures immeasurably, and teaches trust of the outside world, confidence in negotiating it, flexibility and resiliency. And the bonds between teachers and children are wonderful and special, and would be such a loss to miss. Think of teachers you loved or emulated. Some fine teachers really saved my bacon, when my parents could not. The mother should help her child learn to go out into safe, nurturing places in the world, and let her go. When a parent holds on so tightly to her kids, is she doing it for them, or for her own needs?</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">Does she have enough outside relationships of her own? (Does she just want an excuse not to have an outside job?) If the kids stay at home for so many years, won't it make it harder for them to separate when they need to? Will Mom let them go when they need to go? I can't help thinking of the psychological concepts of enmeshment and the rubber-fence family. Fresh air, fresh people and ideas are good for families. Yes, the world is a scary place, but there ARE excellent schools, and superb teachers out there, who will only enhance your child's understanding of life and relationships and the world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">The experience of being part of a group of children is wonderful for kids, so much fun and so instructive about people and life. Kids are naturally social beings, especially before they hit puberty. (As an aside, I could see where homeschooling AFTER puberty might really be beneficial to certain kids.) It seems detrimental to restrict their interactions to just mom or siblings, or occasional play with other kids at the park. They may fear or avoid large group interaction in future if they never have a chance to learn what it's like. Their social skills may not develop, and they may be shy or easy to bully. Trade kids with a mom or two several days a week, so that they get experience of other moms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="227">Team-teach with other moms &amp; kids. And really do these things a lot, not just one day a week or something. You might also want to check out the alternative of enrolling your kids in parent co-operative school settings, where you can work in the classroom and contribute in other ways. My son is in a school like this (Crestmont), and I get to be in the class one day a week, and see the amazing teachers in action, and watch him making relationships and growing. I'm good, but I could never teach him all this. And I have plenty of time to have a strong relationship and have a strong positive impact at home. Remember, school does not run year-round.</paragraph><paragraph parID="228">Anyway, some points to consider. Blessings on all parents &amp; kids. I missed the original question posted about homeschooling, but I saw the most recent response. My son homeschooled for four years and has just returned to school for 8th grade. We've had a very good experience, both with our homeschooling years, and with the transition back into school, but homeschooling is not for everyone. I would urge strongly that anyone making a decision about it speak directly to people who have done it. Otherwise, you are just weighing people's fantasies, both positive and negative.</paragraph><paragraph parID="229">The most prevalent anxiety is that taking a child out of the institutional setting is damaging for social development. Another common one is that the mother-child relationship is inimical to development. Both these anxieties are misplaced. Weigh pros and cons based on real information. I'd be happy to provide contacts. Best wishes. LS</paragraph><paragraph parID="230">How do you decide if homeschooling is the best for your family? Do you need a special room in your house? How do you also care for younger siblings? Do people who are homeschooling feel their children are missing out on learning how to make friends, socialize? Unschooling is a system that doesn't force unwanted facts on children at a set rate, nor does it put them in a box. It is very free-flowing and loose. There is no pressure to learn to read, for instance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="231">But when a child decides on her own that she is interested in a subject, it is the parents' responsibility to provide her all she needs to learn all about her interest. Also, parents are supposed to keep the materials around, but never push the subjects, as the children will show an interest when they're ready. Homeschooling is the same thing as public school, but the parent is the teacher in all subject and there is much less peer interaction. Unschooling is a branch of homeschooling. Homeschoolers use different methods. Some are traditional and use regular textbooks or take community college classes. Unschooling is less traditional, usually interest-driven by the children, who tend to immerse themselves in a topic and explore it thoroughly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">Hello, I have three daughters, 7, 4, and 2. Also, it can be very difficult for some kids to go from homeschooling back into the normal school environment so make sure that it's really the best option for you, your family, and most importantly your daughter. It might save money but is it worth it? Good luck with your decision. think about it carefully Hi, There is a wonderful independent study charter school called California Virtual Academies that provides curriculum and credentialed teacher support to each enrolled student. I have known many unschoolers who are bright, creative, talented, and socially adept. Whether or not you choose to unschool or even homeschool, the ideas of unschooling can be useful for healthy and happy relationships between parents and children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">They currently go to a Catholic school, and we are realizing that their current path is not at all what we envision for them. It is really important to us that we raise girls who are not only excellent students (they are), but strong and aware that the world extends beyond Limited Too and Webkinz! Our oldest is in 5th grade,a great kid but a little naive socially, and mucking through the mire of nasty girls who tear each other apart at any opportunity. What we want is to explore home-schooling her, meeting up with other home schooled kids, and supplementing what she is learning with travel to other, less fortunate, but amazing places on our planet. At the same time, we would like to have her enter high school more than well prepared for the academics ahead, as her choice of college is totally wide open. It is so important to us that our girls learn to be strong women who are part of the SOLUTION, not tearing other women apart in this crazy, keep-up-with-the-Joneses society. I'd be particularly interested to hear from Albany parents about working with that school system, but any thoughts would be helpful!</paragraph><paragraph parID="234">Most are thrilled to have these intelligent, responsible, self-directed young people and many are actively recruiting them. Virtually all colleges, universities and vocational institutes throughout the country now accept homeschooled students. It's easy and inexpensive to join MHA. Why do families homeschool? Families homeschool for any number of reasons, but ultimately they do it because they believe it is the best approach for their family. Some families have removed their children from school after difficulties with the school district, or because they felt their children could make better progress at home. Others have never sent their children to school at all.</paragraph><paragraph parID="235">Still others homeschool because of their educational philosophies or religious convictions. There are families homeschooling with gifted children, children with learning challenges, and children remarkably similar to yours. MHA respects each family's reasons for homeschooling. Regardless of the methods they use, homeschoolers routinely find that they can accomplish much more at home than they can in the same amount of time at an institutional school. Homeschooling honors that fact by giving parents the freedom to use the methods that work best for each child, accounting for any special needs they may have. A key practical difference is that homeschools are considerably more flexible than public schools, whether online or not. Homeschooling parents typically seek out and use the methods and materials that work best for their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="236">Public schools have very little ability to tailor instruction to individual students, and must rely on standardized methods and materials. While these work for some students, they result in boredom and frustration for others. Another key difference is philosophical. A homeschooling family takes direct responsibility for raising and educating its children, while families placing their children in public schools (whether online or not), delegate responsibility for their children to school officials. Your children will interact with other children and adults everywhere they go: libraries, museums, parks, stores, MHA events, family trips, etc. Purchase a book or two on personal organization, and perhaps a homeschooling guide as well. However, if you get involved in local homeschooling groups, you will be amazed how many other options there are.</paragraph><paragraph parID="237">Take at least one more year to spend one on one with this child; you both may discover things about the other you never knew. Any extra time you can spend with your child is precious time. The first one or two years are usually spent deciphering your child's learning style and figuring out what works best for them. The one thing a working homeschooling parent must have is support. Unique educational opportunities for the child, like being accepted into a specialty high school. #4 ...

Ability to do volunteer work for others less fortunate (e.g., geriatric facilities, SPCA, VFW/American Legion, etc.) #84 ...

Older students reinforce their learning by teaching younger siblings #88 ... No more false government school generated "generation gap," "generation X," etc. by separating young adults (teens) from their parents during the years they most need them. Young people are forced to find role models and standards in immature friends rather than in their adult family members. Instead, homeschooled families are experiencing the "all inclusive generation" that enjoys one another's company.</paragraph><paragraph parID="252">(Many different types of books could be in use for homeschooling due to the learning style of the scholar.) School need not be missed due to sickness or bad weather. Parents often serve as facilitators, helping the child to find the resources necessary for learning. Some homeschooling parents choose to do so, while others believe that when you teach your children one-on-one, their understanding of the material is readily apparent. Homeschool conferences like the CHN Family Expo have vendor halls where you can look through curriculum before making a purchase, and talk to an experienced salesperson, or perhaps even the author! It would be a rare teacher who could teach every subject, and parents are no different. Another study done by the National Home Education Research Institute (NHERI) concluded that there were 1.23 million homeschooled children in the United States in the fall of 1996, with an estimated error of measurement of ten percent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="253">It is true that the choice to homeschool removes the child from the intensive, ready-made social world of school, but it's easy to supply social experiences sufficient in quantity and probably superior in quality to those at school. For instance, the Washington Homeschool Research Project has analyzed the SAT scores of homeschooled children in Washington State since 1985. Homeschooling is an educational option in which the parents assume the responsibility for educating their children at home. Homeschooling or family-based education has been the primary mode of education for most of recorded history. The modern homeschooling movement, which was a return to family-based education, began in the 1960's. How many homeschooling families are there? Estimates of homeschooling children vary.</paragraph><paragraph parID="254">The experience is natural and very positive. This is probably the most commonly voiced concern about homeschooling. There are plenty of opportunities for homeschoolers to socialize. For some, the increased family time, flexibility, and freedom from social peer pressure makes the decision an easy one. There is also the benefit of allowing a child to learn at their own pace, and focus on subjects that interest them. Homeschooling allows a parent complete control over their child's education by both knowing what level their child is learning at and also providing their child with one-on-one learning. Homeschooling allows parents to become personally involved in their children's education and their everyday lives.</paragraph><paragraph parID="255">There are more and more families making the decision to homeschool their children. For some it is an easy decision, but for many others it is a difficult one filled with questions about how to get started and whether or not it is the right thing for their kids. For those who are trying to decide if it something they want to do, there are many things to take into consideration. There are many benefits to homeschooling, as well as some disadvantages that should also be considered. There are also several different teaching methods with advantages and disadvantages depending on your child's style of learning. There are many reasons why families are choosing to homeschool their children. Homeschool Explained A list of reasons why parents choose to homeschool along with additional resources.</paragraph><paragraph parID="256">The most common reasons parents gave for homeschooling was a desire to provide religious or moral instruction (36% of students) followed by concern about school environment such as safety, drugs or peer pressure (21%). Dissatisfaction with academic instruction was noted by 17% and other reasons such as family time, finances, travel and distance were mentioned by 14%. About 7% of homeschooling parents mentioned a nontraditional approach to education as paramount in their decision. Another 6% mentioned child's health problems or special needs. Let's say that you had lost faith (or never had faith) in the traditional school system for your family and you decided to homeschool. Yes, these kids are protected from harmful influences at school. Yes these kids get a lot of personal attention.</paragraph><paragraph parID="257">Yes, these kids learn to spell really really well. Yes, they go to college and to fine colleges in disproportionately high numbers. Yes, they've shown themselves to be creative (the best-seller book Eragon was written by homeschooler in high school). What Do Parents Say? My daughter is really benefiting from using the Time4learning program, and it is great to see a program that helps keep her interested in learning! Time4Learning not only offers a fun way for children to complete their school work, but they also keep records for parents to use if they have to report their child's progress. The Significance of Homeschooling</paragraph><paragraph parID="258">Nearly three percent of the population homeschooling is huge: six percent is mind-blowing. And so far, the significance of this trend is not really discussed or understood. The computer and internet have become valuable tools for homeschooling parents. Online learning can form the core of the homeschooling curriculum or can supplement other programs. Consumers (parents), who have become dissatisfied with the educational product of the mainstream schools, are turning to other means for their children's academics, including the do-it-yourself method, homeschooling. My husband and I turned to homeschooling because of health reasons: our daughter suffered from migraine headaches, and the school nurse didn't believe us or our doctors. A survey of homeschooling families today would reveal many who are motivated by their children's health concerns or special needs issues.</paragraph><paragraph parID="259">Another, larger group would say they are dissatisfied with the quality of education provided by today's schools, both public and private. Classroom size and the related student-to-teacher ratios, the disappearance of fine arts programs, and sex and violence in the schools are sub-topics of the "quality of education" issue. A few more families would list flexibility as their primary reason for choosing homeschooling: students can pursue a variety of individual activities, while still maintaining their academic endeavors. Today's homeschooled students may very well be tomorrow's Olympic champions or symphony musicians, since the freedom of a homeschool schedule allows more time to focus on one's passions. Childcare concerns, changes in the job market, and relocation of the family also depend on the flexibility of homeschooling to help families maintain stability during lifestyle changes. Some families opt for homeschooling after the government schools have failed to meet their students' needs. First and foremost, I see the improved relationship of the family as the chief benefit, even before any academic advantages are considered.</paragraph><paragraph parID="260">Parents and children bond as teacher and students in a way that non-homeschooling families just cannot understand. The freedom and flexibility of the homeschooling schedule allow for spontaneous family activities, all of which have educational benefits, whether obvious (or intended) or not. That relaxed schedule is a tremendous boon to most families - the opportunity to do things in whatever order or method works best for each family and each student (which, incidentally, is the philosophy of Guilt-Free Homeschooling : homeschooling should be comfortable, relaxed, and fit your family's lifestyle ). The one-on-one attention that homeschooling provides is far superior to any classroom. Parents of special needs students find that no teacher, no matter how well trained, can know the student or love the student as well as the parent can. Besides the reasons of academic excellence and personalization, homeschooling allows families to emphasize their own philosophies and worldviews. Government-mandated curricula are often based on evolutionary principles, which are diametrically opposed to Creationists' beliefs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="261">Homeschooling allows these families to use materials that support their beliefs, such as that life is sacred and a precious gift from God, the Creator. Families for whom personal Christianity is the guiding force in their lives want to see their children educated with God-centered principles, a Creationist viewpoint, and a Biblical worldview. The homeschooling movement, in general, is providing a return to excellence and individuality in education, a return to a focus on the family as an institution in society, and a return to individual responsibility as a primary duty of citizenship. When the tomatoes at your local market are less than desirable, you may start looking elsewhere for your produce. No one intentionally shops for tomatoes that are unripe, hard, and green, or worse, bruised and blemished. If the supermarket produce is less than satisfactory, consumers may turn to a specialty grocer, the weekly farmer's market, or start their own garden plot at home in the backyard or in a few pots on the patio or balcony. A similar phenomenon is happening with education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="262">My daughter's frequent absences were a problem with the school's administration, although her grades never slipped, since I was able to tutor her at home and keep her on track with the rest of the students. Meanwhile, I had noticed that the classroom's progress was not ideal. The teacher got important concepts wrong and was unable to teach critical math skills. This ineffectual teaching forced us to take matters into our own hands. Literally. I do not have a teaching degree, but I quickly realized that I could certainly do no worse than our local elementary school was already doing. Our reasons for homeschooling are not unique.</paragraph><paragraph parID="263">Those parents who are re-teaching the material to their child every night, as I was, cannot help but see that they are already the primary educator of that child; they just have the worst time slot of the day in which to do it. Some families are able to decide before preschool (or even sooner) that they want to keep their children at home for school. Some families homeschool for only a year or two, while others prefer home education from preschool through high school and even on into college-at-home. The duration is determined by the family's preference, just as the methods and materials used are also each family's choice. I am often asked about the benefits of homeschooling, a difficult question simply because of the vast range of its answers. Even large families are able to provide individual attention to each student when he needs it, along with the training in independent learning, which prepares homeschooled students for handling college classes (and life in general) on their own. The parent who has lived with the special needs child 24/7 since birth understands more and at a deeper level than a teacher who is hired to cover seven hours a day, five days a week, nine months of the year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="264">Homeschooling is extremely popular with conservative Christian families, although it is practiced by families of every religious and political persuasion. Government-funded schools do not allow prayer and do not teach the Bible, even as literature, although many anti-Christian religious philosophies and practices are now showing up in those same schools under the guise of "diversity." They will not accept submitting their children to antithetical teaching day in and day out. Homeschooling is not a fad, although some people treat it as such. Public schools, sponsored by a government, are the "new kid on the block." Personal tutoring had been the educational standard for centuries, until the time of the American Civil War, when it became fashionable to apply industrial methods to education by grouping local children together for academic efficiency. In this postmodern era, some old-fashioned homeschooling is just what this world needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="265">All content is Copyright 2004-2011 by Carolyn Morrison.

The reasons are many and varied, the most important probably being that God has ordained parents to be the primary teachers of their children. Education is the parents&#65533; responsibility. * Other reasons are tied to that one--the idea that the family is a whole, rather than a group of individuals that just happen to reside at the same address; the idea that learning is integrated with life rather than separated from it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="269">These fundamental beliefs keep a family homeschooling even when there are good schools in the area. Other reasons, such as academic excellence, continuity in communication of values, or financial constraints are real and important. Homeschooling using classical methodology carries unique challenges, as well as opportunities. Many books have been published about classical education. Most of them describe classical education in a private school setting. This section contains articles which address those challenges, and opportunities. More parents are choosing to homeschool their children because they see the many benefits of homeschooling, differences in ideology and issues with public school policy are only a few reasons why some parents choose homeschooling over public or private schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="270">When parents take the responsibility of educating their children at home, they may need to set aside time to make it work. The task of homeschooling a child is certainly not easy, especially for working parents, single parents or stay-at-home parents. Homeschooling is a full-time commitment and to make sure that the child receives a quality education, parents need to invest time and effort needed. Parents who choose to home school their children should be prepared to spend more money than parents who send their children to public schools. Home schooled children may not have as many opportunities to interact with other children in comparison to children who attend regular schools. Of course, they can make friends with other home schooled children, but it is quite different when special effort has to be made to arrange meetings. Children who are homeschooled would not have this motivation because most of them are educated separately.</paragraph><paragraph parID="271">When considering enrolling a child in a homeschool curriculum, there are many different factors to consider. While there are many positive aspects of homeschooling, there are also the negative aspects of homeschooling. They have to take time to organize and prepare lessons, teach, give tests, and plan field trips. In comparison to public schools, where education is free, homeschooling can be costly. Purchasing the newest curriculum and teaching tools can be very expensive. Parents may choose to use a paid homeschooling program, such programs may have added benefits, but may increase the cost of the child's education. There are also other costs to keep in mind, like project materials, stationery, books, computer software, and field trips.</paragraph><paragraph parID="272">Forming bonds and socializing with children their own age is important for the child's developmental health and development of social skills. If home schooled, they may be deprived of the chance to form friendships and may suffer socially. The lack of socialization may affect them in later stages of life. Lack of Facilities It is quite impossible that a home can be as well-equipped as a regular school in terms of facilities. For classes that require experiments like physics and chemistry, it can be hard to get all the necessary chemicals, materials, apparatus, and so on. The home would also lack facilities for sports like swimming pools, running tracks, gyms, and fields.</paragraph><paragraph parID="273">One of the reasons why homeschooling is bad is the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parents may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner. It is may be hard for parents to draw the line between educator and parent in the child's mind. One of the most glaring negative effects of homeschooling is the matter of motivation. Some children need to be challenged to excel in their studies. An Education Designed for Your Child.

Also, the way that children are treated now by teachers is unacceptable. Both my son and daughter have been yelled at by their teachers in ways I wouldn't even yell at them.

Dealing With Someone Who's Against Homeschooling? As a former science teacher and department head of a public high school in the Toronto, Ontario area, his reasons for being anti-homeschooling were two-fold. He has only come in contact with students who have been put back in public school after a time of homeschooling... essentially; he hasn't really met any successful homeschoolers. Although there are many successfully homeschooled students who decide to re-enter the public school system for various reasons, I would venture to say, that most don't ever see the inside of a public school classroom, until they go to college. Perhaps many of them only see the "fall-outs" or the students who wouldn't make it in the best of educational situations - private, public or homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="280">Yes, there are unqualified homeschooling parents; however, there are also many bad professional educators, unfortunately. They are added to our "numbers" as a homeschooled student. Perhaps, it's some of these kids who end up going back to public school after being "homeschooled" for a time. The public education system may see hundreds of "sub-par" homeschooled students, but if you turn the tables, thousands of "sub-par" public schooled students join our ranks every year. Many students are from families who are well educated, but interestingly, many successful homeschool students are from very average families where the highest educational degree of the parents is a high school diploma. So back to my uncle who was against homeschooling... What made an extremely educated educator turn from being totally against homeschooling and begin to have to a more favorable view of home education?</paragraph><paragraph parID="281">He also has two nieces who homeschool and has been able to interact with our children. Interaction with Homeschoolers As educators interact with homeschooled students, most realize that homeschooling is a wonderful educational option and support parents who choose to homeschool their children. Many also begin to offer their services to the homeschool community in their free time, when retired or in between teaching jobs. As a homeschooling parent you may find others who are against homeschooling, from friends and family to well known people in the media. I didn't throw statistics at him, try to change his mind, prove to him how "smart" my kids are, and didn't get defensive about homeschooling. I had an interesting conversation with my uncle last year, who admitted he was totally against homeschooling, up until recently.</paragraph><paragraph parID="282">He doesn't understand that parents can successfully teach their kids without knowing the pedagogy of teaching.

Concerned parents who are dissatisfied with institutionalized education - public and private, are forced to take on the role as home educator to meet their children's needs. Dissatisfied Parents Take Action These willing parents, sacrificially give up their time to do what's best for their child and it's amazing how successful they are! Studies show it really doesn't matter the educational level of the parent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="283">Hard to believe, and maybe, harder to swallow, especially since many educators have completed more than six years of post secondary education. How can a parent, who has less education achieve greater results than someone who is highly trained to teach? Perhaps something unexplainable happens when parents spend time with their children. I would say he changed his opinion because of his ability to have an open mind and a willingness to see things from a different perspective. Although he may be among the most educated people I know, he remains humble despite his vast amount of continually-growing knowledge and his unique love of education and learning. Dealing with Opposition Don't let that ever stop you from choosing to homeschool, though.</paragraph><paragraph parID="284">You will find lots of support from fellow homeschooling parents and others who wish they had or could homeschool, but can't for whatever reason.

In recent months, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal , Newsweek , and The Washington Post have analyzed homeschooling's appeal, with one Stanford professor quoted as saying that homeschooling "has become newly fashionable."

Also, your children will be much less likely to cooperate if they don't sense a united front from mom and dad.</paragraph><paragraph parID="299">You haven't yet taken the time to count the cost. Please don't rush into this decision because your friends are doing it, or because it sounds like fun. (Even though it can definitely be a lot of fun!) You must have a personal conviction and commitment that will carry you through the days when you want to pull your hair out. For the sake of your family, your reasoning must supersede your emotions. You are not willing to learn patience and perseverance. Homeschooling is a personal sacrifice of time and energy based on love.</paragraph><paragraph parID="300">It takes careful planning and a willingness to 'go the distance'. You will not have the luxury of allowing your feelings to dictate whether or to not to homeschool on a particular day. As time goes on, you will be stretched, challenged, and discouraged. You will doubt yourself, your choices, and your sanity. Those things are a given. I've never met a homeschooler who didn't have to deal with them. You are unable or unwilling to live on one income.</paragraph><paragraph parID="301">In order to give your children the kind of education they deserve, you will need to plan on being home full-time! I've watched moms try to work while homeschooling. They are stretched in too many directions and tend to burn out! If you are planning to hold even a part-time job while teaching school, especially K-6, you may be better off choosing to not homeschool. When some children are older, they may be much more independent and self-disciplined in their studies, freeing you up to get a part-time position. Carefully consider with your mate what changes are necessary to make your school a priority. It can be done!</paragraph><paragraph parID="302">You are not willing to be involved in your children's education. If your current idea of home educating is to choose a curriculum that your children can do by themselves and just monitor their progress from a distance, well, that might work depending on how independent a learner each child is. But even if they can handle it, you will be missing out on so much. I'm not talking about never using workbooks, some children love them. Workbooks can be beneficial for independent study when you are teaching multiple children at different levels. I love watching moms who are planning hands-on activities to blend into their daily lessons. They are choosing a hands-on approach and their own thirst for knowledge has been rekindled.</paragraph><paragraph parID="303">They are enthusiastic and passionate about influencing their children's lives and giving them a love of learning. I believe that has to be the ultimate goal should you choose to home educate. I hope I haven't discouraged you completely, that isn't my intent. I just want to be sure you seriously consider the impact that choosing to homeschool will have on you and your family. I believe you should have a clear idea of what you would be getting into before you start. If the timing and circumstances aren't right for your family - it's okay to choose to not homeschool! Debunking the myths of home schooling With one to two million American children learning outside of school, home schooling can no longer be considered an extremist position or fad.</paragraph><paragraph parID="304">Home schooling is a valid and effective educational option. Gifts of Homeschooling If homeschooling offers the gift of time, what is that time for? Homeschooling Works There are a number of reasons why homeschooling works, and why we must protect the diversity of homeschooling practices to continue this success. I Was Homeschooled and I Just Didn't Know It After recently hearing about home schooling and reading some of the articles and philosophy of this wonderful way of life, I realized that, in fact, I had been home schooled, and that is the reason I am a well educated person today. The Moore Formula Properly done, home education offers low-stress, low-cost, and high achievement and sociability from a balance of study, work, and service. The Homeschool Alternative Home based education &#173; legal in all 50 states -- is a growing movement that offers parents and children alike the opportunity to grow and learn in a loving and supportive environment. The reasons to homeschool are very individual, and very personal to many homeschoolers; ironically, they are also fairly common .</paragraph><paragraph parID="305">Those who choose to homeschool their kids tend to do so for much the same reasons. These disadvantages are what often draw people to homeschooling , and results in a group of collective, agreeable reasons why homeschooling is better. As diverse as the reasons to homeschool may be the homeschool community is united in some common beliefs in regards to education and child development . Understanding this helps to not only help you decide if homeschooling is right for you, but also to know that you are not alone, and that you do have the support of countless others. While there is no possibility of constructing an all-inclusive list of reasons why homeschool is a better choice , we can take a look at some of the more common: Many homeschoolers (and public "schoolers" too) have serious misgivings about the morals and values that are taught and absorbed when their children are handed over to virtual strangers for the majority of their waking time and influenced by unsupervised peers. It is felt that by homeschooling parents have more control over the values that are held most dear to them and imparted upon their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="306">Many choose homeschooling simply for the more controlled, stable learning environment. There is also no shortage of research to support the fact that children learn in different ways, and some subjects are more likely to be grasped easier than others. In the traditional classroom, there is little opportunity to personalize learning. In the homeschool environment, that is very much a possibility, and in fact is a basic tenet of homeschooling in the opinion of most homeschoolers. Of course these three basic reasons do not even begin to cover all the reasons to homeschool. The reasons why people homeschool are as diverse as the individuals who choose to do it. When it comes down to it people choose to homeschool because it is the right choice for them and their children &#65533; be it for reasons of morals and values, educational attainment, or even flexibility and non-traditional living.</paragraph><paragraph parID="307">The reasons that matter are the reasons that make homeschooling your best option, and grant you and your children the confidence to progress and succeed. This does not really come as much of a surprise if you really think about it. There is a whole host of reasons why the public schools and other group-school educations are lacking. Even the most dedicated traditional school supporter cannot deny that there are distinct disadvantages to large-group educations. Maintaining family values . Quality education and understanding of concepts and subjects . There is no lack of research to show that large classrooms full of children at varying levels of learning and understanding, with high student: teacher ratios, are counterproductive.</paragraph><paragraph parID="308">In short, today's educational system is overtaxed, and learning is made more difficult for it. Every child is unique . What's Right For You Home schooling gives them the chance to be free of old school days with pressure and daily assignments. There are four important reasons why parents opt for home studying for their children, a) social reasons, b) academic reasons, c) family reasons, and d) religious reasons. By joining the community cycle, parents fee that their children are more comfortable in dealing with different kinds of people. They feel that their kids have a lesser tendency of becoming dependent with peers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="309">By introducing the kids more to church and community programs, these home-schooled kids do not feel self conscious and recognized, as kids are easier to talk to. The catalogue, Growing Without Schooling publisher Pat Farenga wrote: "Group experiences are a big part of education, and home schoolers have plenty of them. They write to us about how they form or join writing clubs, book discussion groups and local home-schooling groups. Home schoolers also take part in school sports teams and music groups (in nearby public schools), as well as in the many public and private group activities our communities provide. These young people can and do experience other people and cultures without going to school." The home-school setting deviates the child's attention from alcohol, premarital sex, drugs, violence and gangsters that could destroy his future. And since home-schooled children are free from peer pressure, they are more likely to have more friends from the church and community activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="310">Some communities created a special group for home-schooled children where field trips, social recreations and team building games are organized. This builds respect and opens channels for communication. Parents believe that the less students handled by the teacher, the more focus is provided each of the learners. They thought that the personal tutoring of teachers is the most fruitful way of helping the kids learn successfully. The most famous home-schooled personalities of all time are: Thomas Edison, Charles Dickens, Winston Churchill, Agatha Christie, Florence Nightingale, Woodrow Wilson, Woodrow Brothers, and Benjamin Franklin. One parent got more of his children's academic training in home schooling through the process of exchanging skills with other home schooled children. Being an English degree holder, he teaches three of his colleague's sons, while his colleague teaches his kids math.</paragraph><paragraph parID="311">Although home schooling is, as derived from its own name "home", this special education also developed into a more organized and planned instrument of teaching. One example is the High Plains Christian Home Educators that was established in Colorado Springs who has its own administrator who sees to it that all 200 of their home-schooled children are given enough classes. Unlike a normal school setting, home based studying allows each of the subject areas to be taught separately making the approach cross disciplined. Each of the students is given their own set of action plans so they can have the freedom to continue their passion. Quality time is provided for each so that more focus can be attributed to their learning success. Parents of home-schooled children feel their presence felt by their kids. Family relationship is strengthened and ties are intact.</paragraph><paragraph parID="312">A child's self esteem are more boosted because of the parents' full support. Based on the American League of Research Studies, kids that are home schooled are mo re loving and confident. Schools in the US have kept away from any religious and political issues for fear of influence from the two, this is because many organized civil liberties even brought the issue of religious illegality in courts. For that same reason, parents find teaching their children at home a worry free place for spiritual and religious growth. Religion can be inculcated as much as the parents would want to bring the whole belief to their kids in home schooling and they believe that it's impact can greatly affect the spirituality of their developing children. This is because of the benefits both the parents and the children get as a social being. Due the old set up, many members of the family have become isolated from each other allowing them just a few precious times with their loved ones.</paragraph><paragraph parID="313">Social Reasons Academic Reasons Family Reasons Religious Reasons Homeschooling: A Natural Part of Parenting Homeschooling has been labeled a "homeschool movement" in the last 20 years. Long before formal public education opportunities, families grew and learned together.</paragraph><paragraph parID="314">Whether it's something as seemingly insignificant as how to hold a spoon or chopsticks or as important as walking, parents successfully teach their children these new skills every day.

Parents allow and encourage the child to relate in their own words what they are learning in all subjects. The school days are balanced by spending adequate time with the core subjects while providing plenty of free time to enjoy life.

Why homeschooling In these present times, getting the best education for your children is of the utmost importance. For many, the public school systems have not met the needs of many parents. This has resulted in a growing movement of parents taking the education of their children into their own hands. Home schooling continues to grow and to expand as more and more parents realize the many benefits and advantages of teaching at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="325">It has always been accepted that parents have an inherent right to determine how to raise and educate their children. Homeschooling holds an obvious advantage because as a parent, you are given an opportunity to be completely hands-on with your child&#65533;s education. When most people think of home schooling, what comes to mind is usually basic information that's not particularly interesting or beneficial. But there's a lot more to home schooling than just the basics. Surveys have shown that many parents in the US now prefer homeschooling for their children's education. Many parents say that homeschooling is their best alternative of a child's education. Nowadays, a lot of parents choose homeschooling as their option for their children's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="326">Recent statistics shows that families in the US who now prefer homeschooling for their children have already reached 27%.

Homeschooling is an alternative form of education that is fast growing. There are approximately two million people in the country today that undergo homeschooling. Parents choose homeschooling for many different reasons. Some families want to build up their family ties; homeschooling offers the parents freedom to create and pattern individualized and specific curriculum, safety reasons, peer pressure and discontentment with the school system. Who Said Homeschool is for kids only?</paragraph><paragraph parID="327">They say homeschooling is only for the younger kids in the elementary or lower levels but highschool homeschooling is also a very popular educational choice. Most that do homeschooling are those teenagers who cannot take the pressures at school, especially those of peer pressure and bullying. Others cannot catch up with the lessons and curriculum programs of regular schools or would like to start early in life through training, internship and community volunteering jobs that would help them be knowledgeable and prepared for the struggle outside the four walls of their school.

From the crude and very simple methods and materials, new ones that are more sophisticated and complex have become available.</paragraph><paragraph parID="328">It completely fills up the role of institutional learning. Some want their children to have a conventional education while learning in their own way, at their own pace. Some want their children to pursue special interests. Other parents choose to share more of their beliefs and values than attending conventional school would allow. Some seek academic excellence, while others can't find an acceptable alternative. Some children cannot learn well in a conventional school. Other parents do not want their children trapped by the academic and social pressures of conventional schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="329">Some prefer to learn from life experience. Opportunities to build a stronger family draw others. And some want to take charge of their own lives rather than surrendering them to conventional schools. Homeschooling encompasses all these reasons and more. People can create and maintain a space where children and families are free to learn and live.

Peer Pressure  How many times have you read or heard about a "good kid from a good family" who just got arrested or was the victim of a crime? Homeschooling Gifted Children</paragraph><paragraph parID="332">Nearly one million school-aged children in the United States are educated primarily at home. Many of them are gifted. Parents who wonder if homeschooling will work for them need to consider the reasons for doing it and how to meet their children's academic, social, and emotional needs. Reasons for Gifted Children to Learn at Home Parents who homeschool cite several reasons: traditional schools fail to meet their children's needs; state and district budget cuts have reduced or eliminated many gifted programs; and the gifted programs that remain do not address the social and emotional needs of gifted learners, because they offer few opportunities for peer interaction, self-directed learning, or divergent thinking. For example, a fifth-grader might need to study prealgebra, read high-school-level books, but practice fourth-grade writing skills. Likewise, a child who is advanced in most or all areas can work at advanced levels without formally accelerating into a higher grade.</paragraph><paragraph parID="333">Homeschool parents support their children's emotional needs by accepting and valuing their differences. Intense, highly sensitive, or creative children may feel that something is wrong with them in a classroom that does not tolerate diversity; however, a homeschooled child's family can foster self-understanding through bibliotherapy (the use of books to promote emotional growth) and socializing with small groups of peers. Parents of introverted children can use homeschooling to provide an appropriate balance of alone time, family time, and group time. Socialization: Myths and Realities Nearly every homeschool parent has faced the question "But what about socialization?" Some people assume that children who learn at home are isolated and lack friends and the ability to develop social skills. In reality, homeschooled children participate in many recreational and educational group activities and have ample time to develop meaningful friendships with others of all ages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="334">Insightful parents can use homeschooling to broaden their children's social education through multiage socializing, real-world learning, and opportunities for close friendships. Multiage socializing occurs in homeschool co-ops and support groups, sports teams, clubs, book discussion groups, community classes, and visits to senior centers and nursing homes. Children can experience real-world learning by taking field trips to museums and businesses and by becoming full members of the community through volunteer and civic activities. Homeschool parents can seek opportunities for their children to form friendships by scheduling time for them to play and learn with children who share their intensity, intellect, and creativity. Gifted homeschooled children also benefit from friendships with adults willing to share their passions, conversation, and time. Getting Started To start homeschooling, parents should consider their state's education laws, their children's interests and needs, educational costs, and forms of evaluation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="335">Rules and regulations pertaining to homeschooling vary greatly from state to state. Before beginning homeschooling, parents should contact their state's department of education or homeschool parent association to get a copy of their state's regulations and requirements. But unless advance curriculum plans are specifically required, parents need not have a full year's or even a full semester's curriculum planned by the first day of homeschooling. Many parents begin by concentrating on their children's interests and strengths, which encourages their self-confidence and love of learning. Over time, parents can experiment with ways to address subject areas or skills that do not engage or come easily to their children. To homeschool successfully, parents do not have to know more than their children in every subject area, nor do they need formal training in education. Whereas a classroom teacher must be an expert in many teaching strategies, homeschool parents need to be experts only in regard to their own children's learning styles, personalities, and educational needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="336">When a child surpasses the parent's knowledge base in or ability to teach a particular subject area, his or her needs can be met through distance-learning courses, talent search programs, mentors, community classes, homeschool co-ops, or part-time enrollment in public school, private school, or college. Moreover, many gifted children can learn to teach themselves what they want and need to know. The amount that a family spends on homeschooling will depend, of course, on its resources and budget as well as on its needs and goals. Some families pay for distance-learning courses, summer camps, Saturday programs, part-time college courses, lab equipment, reference books, and other materials. However, many families homeschool successfully and inexpensively by using public and university libraries, used books and materials, the Internet, informal mentors, inexpensive community classes, and scholarships for enrichment programs. Parents have several options for evaluating their children's progress. Some states require that homeschooled students periodically take standardized tests.</paragraph><paragraph parID="337">When parents have a choice among forms of evaluation and assessment, they can also use talent-search testing, student portfolios, chapter and unit tests from textbooks, and informal conversation to track their children's progress. By using formal evaluation only when necessary, they can keep the focus on learning rather than outside measures of achievement. Is Homeschooling Right for Us? Homeschooling is not the best fit for every family. If parents are intrigued by but unsure about homeschooling, they can try it for a semester or a year before making a long-term commitment to it. For parents who like being around their children and are willing to be creative in homeschooling according to their children's cognitive, social, and emotional needs, however, it can be a joyful and rewarding path for them as well as for the children. A much needed article!</paragraph><paragraph parID="338">I homeschooled my sons because the older was diagnosed PDD-NOS. We could accomodate his sensory quirks in homeschool and maintain strict discipline while he learned. When our circumstances changed, and they began public school, both boys tested as gifted and performing at grade level. There are some wonderful unit studies and math programs for homeschooling. The uneven or asynchronous development of some gifted children make homeschooling a particularly good fit for them, because their parents can tailor a curriculum to their children's own intellectual progress. By planning a social and emotional curriculum, homeschool parents can help their children accept themselved and realize their potential. In other words, we did not start our family in order to enrich a home school program; rather, we elected to pursue home schooling because we sincerely believed that it would help us to establish a Christ-honoring household by the grace of God.</paragraph><paragraph parID="339">The purpose of this article is to challenge parents to home school in a disciplined and orderly manner, for it is my sincere belief that only a structured approach to home schooling is consistent with biblical standards. This message is born out of a desire to see more parents prosper in their commitment to home school by adopting or maintaining approaches to learning that are true to Holy Scripture. The home school movement in the United States is now entering its second generation phase. In marksmanship training, students are commonly taught how to properly acquire their target, or to take aim. Junior marksmen also learn how to pursue every shot with care and deliberation, while they remain focused on their target. Even though we are clearly in the ranks of "seasoned" home educators, it is still common for us to question whether our efforts are truly enriching our family and forging godly character traits in our children. This Tips for Parents article is from a seminar hosted by Meredith Warshaw, who discusses how homeschooling is often a good option for twice exceptional children because it allows for different levels of individual subjects to be taught.</paragraph><paragraph parID="340">Homeschooling can be an excellent way to meet the needs of twice-exceptional children, allowing them to use their strengths and preferred learning styles. It is important to make use of available support networks - find links to state and local homeschooling groups online. Homeschooling doesn't have to look like "school at home" (and, for our kids, that's one of the best parts!) Homeschoolers can have plenty of opportunity for social contact. Homeschooling can indeed be a wonderful way of bringing light back into our children's educational experiences! It also allows one to focus on the child in the ways that work best for that particular student. In homeschooling, it is easy to accommodate a child who is on multiple grade levels -- it is not a problem if the child is at a 3rd grade level for writing and an 8th grade level for math.</paragraph><paragraph parID="341">In addition, most homeschoolers are much less age-conscious than schools are and see no reason that every child in a class should have to be the same age, allowing the highly gifted child access to a wide variety of classes that schools would not offer at younger ages. Another benefit for the twice-exceptional child who needs remedial services, such as OT or vision therapy, is that the child has time and energy for these important services rather than being overburdened by sandwiching them in after school or in addition to homework. It doesn't have to be done entirely by the parents -- classes, tutors, mentors, online courses and correspondence courses are all useful resources. You do not have to be a perfect teacher to do a better job than the schools with your child. Classroom teachers have to try to meet the needs of a large group of children, while you have the luxury of working with your child as an individual. In fact, because they are not overburdened with homework, they often have more time for socializing than school children. You don't have to go at it alone -- there is help available both online and in person (local homeschooling groups).</paragraph><paragraph parID="342">American homeschoolers enjoy a freedom that many around the world only dream about.

In this informative webinar, author and teacher Kathy Weitz will discuss the tried and true classical tradition of progymnasmata -a graduated series of exercises by which Greek students were trained in the arts of writing and oratory. This method has produced many of the best thinkers, authors, and statesmen of the Western world and can cultivate holistic writing skills in your students, as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="346">Kathy is part of the Classical Writing team, a group of four homeschooling mothers who have integrated grammar, logic, and literature analysis with the progymnasmata in a unique homeschool curriculum. With so many beneficial opportunities available, homeschooling parents need to be very wise in designing their students' high school curriculum track. The problem is not that there is a shortage of choices, but, rather, that there is an over-abundance of good choices! After counseling thousands of homeschool families for the past 23 years, Chris Klicka, homeschool father of 7 children, gives down-to-earth encouragement to stay the course. He provides solutions to common problems like: 1) Your children want to play sports, 2) Your children are teenagers, 3) You are burned out, 4) You can't financially afford it, 5) You can't teach trigonometry, 6) Your children are not disciplined, 7) You can receive free education through the public schools, 8) A parent has health problems, 9) Your child has special needs, and 10) Your husband is not very supportive. Public schools not only isolate teens from their families and the benefits of work, but they also trap teens with peers during most of their waking hours. "Peers are the last people on earth from whom teens should be learning," says Dr. Epstein.</paragraph><paragraph parID="347">"Socialization needs to occur with people of all ages, and especially with responsible adults, and the kind of socialization that occurs in our schools, especially our middle and high schools, is often bizarre, driven mainly by the media and fashion industries." One of the great beauties of homeschooling is the opportunity it provides to turn all of life into a learning experience-and author, speaker, and homeschool mom Zan Tyler wants to share her thoughts on both the educational and spiritual lessons to be found in the holidays. Don't miss this opportunity to discover the juncture between education and celebration and to help your children learn and promote the deeper reasons for the season! Husbands who understand this can succeed in their homeschools without sacrificing their other God-given priorities. You can have the best homeschooling year ever! The purpose of homeschool to me is being able to teach our children the way we as parents see fit. As a traditional homeschooler you do not have to seek permission from anyone but yourself or you have the opportunity to ask a home professional who has home schooled their child for a number of years.</paragraph><paragraph parID="348">My decision to home school my children was to be able to bring the Christian faith into my schooling, you can't get that in public school. I pick the curriculum, I teach my children...I call it homeschooling. On the other hand, some online schools like charter schools give you more freedom than that of online school. If you online school through a public school, the public school...they count your child as part of the school district and they get paid for it. There have been countless studies done on socialization and homeschooling and children who are home schooled come out fine in socialization. Many home schooled parents enroll their children in activities such as dance, musical instructions, scouting, 4-H and other extra curricula activities. Home schooled children have enrolled in their local theaters as well!</paragraph><paragraph parID="349">There are so many opportunities for homeschoolers to socialize and not just in a public school setting! It's very obvious amongst all children in public schools as well as homeschools that some are really good at math &amp; others not so much, some love science while others love history, &amp; grammar comes naturally for those who love to read while others are bored to sleep by it. This is one of many reasons why public schooling of large groups of children simply doesn't work for many, while others seem to thrive. The main problem I had with our public schools was the fact that they refused to listen to any suggestions or criticism from the parents. Their way was the only right way as far as they were concerned, even when over half of the kids were failing and were downright miserable because of the whole school experience. For my girls, there was so much work with so little understanding. The beauty of homeschooling is that the family gets to decide what's best for it's own, no matter what.</paragraph><paragraph parID="350">It seems to me that if a parent chooses to teach his/her own child in the home, that parent is homeschooling. Some of the comments have focused on the fact that charter schools or online schools create a situation where the parent has to answer to someone else and therefore is no longer homeschooling. I would argue that most parents who have agreed to these situations are aware that they have other options and, if that parent feels that another option would better serve the student or family, is likely to change. In fact, several of the people who made that type of comment have done just that. This tells me that parents in such situations are ultimately still calling the shots. They are not as likely as a typical public school parent to feel that they are stuck with whatever is offered. That is where the real power of homeschooling lies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="351">There's no "one" right way or wrong way to teach a child, what works for one may not work for the other. I knew many families who homeschooled using a local public charter school. I would agree that the daily instruction was what I would consider homeschooling, in fact, we sometimes had curriculum choices in common. From my perspective, if the parents themselves are educated on what TRUE homeschooling REALLY is about &amp; its 'unmatched' benefits, then today's homeschool options may be logical choices for many families. For example, way back in time learning was personalized and the children exceeded greatly. Today, barely being mediocre seems to be the new standard for masses of institutionalized students who are in group instructions for hours on end. If we blend today's advanced technology with the kids' right to excel on an individual basis thru home education in any of its various forms, then these students can take their knowledge and skills and create a better tomorrow for their generation &amp; future families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="352">It is the best of both worlds for me. In addition to that I can pick the classes I want to teach at home and the ones I would like covered at the school. Isn't one of the reasons we homeschool to avoid labels? I enjoy the freedom to create our own curriculum &amp; teach the way that fits our children best...others should have that same freedom without criticism or being made to feel left out of the home education community...whatever method they choose! Public schools are failing and because of it we're withdrawing our children. However with the online schools and tutors, we feel empowered to keep our child home and give her a Christian education. Each family is different with different situations, and therefore, there are different types of schooling and learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="353">The reason I home school isn't because I dislike the state's curriculum for my child, however. He didn't thrive in the public school environment and is more suited to home instruction. Other people home school for different reasons and would cringe at our choice of curriculum. Many of my son's friends are unschooled and there's no way they would be happy or learn as much as they have using our methods. That's the beauty of home schooling. We know our kids and can tailor their educations accordingly. Although I am not a super fan of "unschooling" I know that what works for one child may not work for another.</paragraph><paragraph parID="354">I choose the curricula my daughter thrives in, and we do it our own way. * One or more professional lobbyists can seriously undermine a grassroots organization, even if they are homeschoolers themselves and/or are volunteering their time. Therefore, paid lobbyists tend to emphasize the weaknesses and overlook the strengths of homeschoolers. Homeschoolers are much better off if they do not try to play that game but instead present themselves as the solidly-based group of responsible citizens that they are. * Lawyers who are used to resolving non-homeschooling issues through the courts may automatically decide to take a case to court. * If we are forced into the legislature, we can respond by working with other homeschoolers who are committed to protecting the rights of parents to homeschool, by making homeschooling a minority rights issue, and by trying to get a law with the least possible state regulation of homeschooling. Many homeschoolers find it helps to write down the reasons why they are homeschooling, their goals for their children (including goals that are not conventionally considered "academic" such as character development, acquiring moral and spiritual values, etc.).</paragraph><paragraph parID="355">When the seemingly inevitable personal doubts do arise, many homeschoolers find it is very helpful to talk with other homeschooling parents they have met through support groups or in other ways, to share experiences and gain from each other's experiences. Watching our children grow and taking time to realize how much they are learning, in so many areas, gives many parents the conviction we need to continue homeschooling in the face of adversity. When we know exactly what our state law requires, when we have connected with other homeschoolers on a grassroots level within our state and are committed to working to secure our right to homeschool without undue government regulation, and when we have realized that we can stand up to unreasonable demands from public officials, we can feel prepared to deal with challenges to our freedom if they materialize. (If our right to homeschool is linked to particular religious beliefs, we risk losing the fundamental and essential principle that parents, not the state, have responsibility for children except in rare cases in which the state can demonstrate a clear and compelling need to intervene in family life.) The black and white outcome concerning homeschooling that would most likely be acceptable to the general public would be one in which the government strongly regulated homeschools that were clearly very much like conventional schools. Homeschoolers are too small a minority and too often misunderstood to be able to gain the protection they need simply by introducing protective legislation and seeking court cases that will supposedly then be decided in homeschoolers' favor (generally they are not). Although not many "ordinary citizens" do this sort of thing, we can as long as we have strong commitments to families, parents' rights, and homeschooling; a clear understanding of the realities of our situation; and a willingness to work with other parents who want to homeschool their children for a wide variety of reasons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="356">Inevitably many people stop thinking and working as hard as they were before the experts arrived and are robbed of the opportunity to discover how much they can do for themselves. Legislators are often drawn to such lobbyists because they are accustomed to working with such individuals, so it becomes more difficult for "ordinary citizens" to reach their legislators. However, professional lobbyists are part of a system based on large numbers of people, large sums of money, and powerful interest groups (such as industries, teachers unions, etc.). Gradually we will win the hearts and minds of the people and support of our local communities as their understanding of homeschooling grows. * We can be willing to work on the grassroots level, to form inclusive homeschooling organizations, to take the time required to listen to differing opinions and develop consensus, and gradually build solid organizations that will withstand challenges from opponents of homeschooling. * Using actions like those suggested above, we can stay out of court if at all possible. * Perhaps most importantly, we can realize and accept that we have to live with some ambiguity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="357">There is no one right way to homeschool. Children and families vary greatly, and each need to make their own decisions. There is also no final, once and for all solution to the problem of protecting homeschooling from its opponents. People will always need to work to ensure freedom, whether it is the freedom to homeschool or any other freedom. Learning to live with some ambiguity and uncertainty can be a real challenge, especially in an area as important as fundamental freedoms and our children's educations. Here are some suggestions: - Keep clearly in mind why we are homeschooling and how we are going about it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="358">The more we are confident about what we are doing as individuals, the more we are able to accept and withstand the ambiguities of the external system and the doubts of others. - Have faith in a higher power. Homeschoolers have a variety of religious beliefs. It is important for us as a group to work for the fundamental right of parents to homeschool, without requiring that they adopt specific religious beliefs. - Accept the fact that for a small minority like homeschoolers, ambiguity is inevitable. This outcome is unacceptable to us as homeschools. Therefore, we are much better off in an ambiguous situation than in a black and white one.</paragraph><paragraph parID="359">It is, in fact, our only real choice. Attempts to solve homeschooling problems simply and easily through legislation and court cases just will not work. Instead, we homeschoolers must take responsibility for ourselves, on a local and state level, and decide what strategy is likely to work best in our local community and state. Before we start feeling overwhelmed by the situation we face, let us consider some of the important and valuable strengths we have as homeschoolers: * As people who have willingly (and often gladly) strongly affirmed the responsibility parents have for their children's educations and who have decided to exercise that responsibility ourselves rather than turning part of it over to conventional schools, we have had important experience in exercising responsibility and doing things ourselves, for ourselves, the way we feel they should be done. Therefore, we are in a good position to take on the responsibility for our own homeschool and our right to homeschool. We understand the major advantages that come from working to protect our own rights that are so essential to us, rather than turning this responsibility over to someone else, someone less directly involved and therefore inevitably less committed to our homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="360">* As homeschoolers who believe that parents have the right to choose for their children an education consistent with their principles and beliefs, we have had experience working with others who share this commitment. We can work together to maintain parents' rights, realizing that we may not agree on specific religious beliefs or specific approaches to education. We realize that it is more important to protect the rights of parents than it is for parents to agree on all the details. In fact, many homeschoolers feel that because each individual family is unique and knows best its own strengths and needs, each family needs to make its own decisions about the approach to education it will choose, its religious beliefs, and other such matters. * There are logical, legal, historical, practical, moral, and religious arguments against unnecessary and restrictive government regulation of homeschooling. (For one listing, see our book, Taking Charge Through Home Schooling: Personal and Political Empowerment, pp. 219-240.) Many people who do not necessarily understand or support homeschooling will nevertheless support principles such as: parents (and not the state) should have the basic responsibility for their own children, minorities in America should be protected, freedom of education is essential to a free society, unreasonable and unnecessary government regulation will prevent homeschools from being the alternatives they need to be.</paragraph><paragraph parID="361">* Many examples, personal stories, and case studies can be presented to show others how well homeschooling works. Many skeptics and critics of homeschooling have become supporters once they became acquainted with a "real live" homeschooling family and saw how confident, resourceful, knowledgeable, capable, and enthusiastic they were and how well they could relate to a wide variety of people of varying ages. (So much for all those concerns about "socialization!") Among the most impressive examples are the children who have had difficulty learning in a conventional school setting but who learn very well at home. * Homeschooling represents a broad spectrum of the population, people with different perspectives and affiliations. Citizenship or Lawyership Choosing Political Strategies for Homeschoolers This article, by Larry and Susan Kaseman, was originally published in the September-October 1993 issue of Home Education Magazine.</paragraph><paragraph parID="362">If you knew that there are effective ways in which homeschoolers can act to protect our rights to homeschool without unreasonable government regulation, wouldn't you want to take action? We need to be aware of the ever-present possibility that increased government regulation will restrict our ability to choose for our children an education consistent with our principles and beliefs. As individuals and as a group we need to act in ways that will protect our freedom and avoid actions being proposed and carried out by some individuals and organizations that would result in serious limitations of our freedom to homeschool. This column will show that given the realities of the situation facing homeschoolers, we are unlikely to be able to meet the challenges we face by adopting black and white solutions like introducing new homeschooling legislation and/or taking test cases to court in an attempt to preserve or regain homeschooling freedoms, in other words, by using what we call "lawyership" rather than working through citizenship. Although homeschooling is gaining recognition and support throughout the country, the number of people who are strongly committed to homeschooling is quite small, even when friends, relatives, and other supporters of homeschooling are included. Not only are homeschoolers a relatively small group; conventional education is gigantic. To be sure, homeschooling is important and is growing steadily.</paragraph><paragraph parID="363">But starting from such a small base, even with phenomenal growth, homeschoolers will continue to be a small minority for the foreseeable future. Homeschoolers need to choose their political strategies based on this reality. * Homeschoolers are perceived as an economic threat to conventional schools. Homeschoolers actually save taxpayers an enormous amount of tax money that would have to be spent on homeschooled children if they were attending public schools. (The average cost to educate one child in a public school for a year is about $6,000.) * Homeschooling is different from conventional schooling. It shows that children can learn well in their own homes with their own families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="364">It shows that children do not have to be in special institutional settings or have professionally trained teachers in order to learn. This point is further strengthened by the experiences we have all heard about or participated in ourselves involving children who had trouble learning in conventional schools but did very well at home. * Homeschoolers are a wonderfully convenient and easy target for beleaguered school officials who need a way to divert public attention away from their schools with their overwhelming and many-faceted failings and problems. Children learn in many different ways and according to their own timetables. Homeschooling works because parents who choose to undertake the work and responsibility of homeschooling care deeply about their children and want what is best for them. Homeschooling works because children are eager to learn and are good at learning when they have the materials, support, and flexibility they need. Therefore state-mandated testing of homeschoolers means state-control of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="365">Homeschoolers could also be forced into OBE by plans that would require anyone who wants to attend college and/or earn a certificate of employability (required for some jobs) to pass specific state-mandated exams. As homeschoolers we can reduce the chances of being drawn into OBE by refusing to be measured by conventional schools standards. When individual homeschoolers or homeschooling organizations publicize and/or share with legislators and school officials the scores homeschoolers have gotten on standardized tests (even tests they have voluntarily selected and taken), they are giving legislators the clear impression that homeschoolers feel that their children can and should be evaluated by conventional schools standards. Given the pressures from opponents of homeschooling, some homeschoolers argue that the best way for homeschoolers to be secure is by trying to get legislation passed that would guarantee the right to homeschool without restrictive regulation. * Because the general public often does not understand or support homeschooling, it is very difficult to get most legislators to support legislation that has been introduced by homeschoolers that is favorable to homeschooling. It is somewhat easier to get legislators to vote against legislation that has been introduced by opponents of homeschooling that would unnecessarily and unreasonably increase government regulation of homeschooling. Therefore, if a state really needs new legislation because of a court decision, we homeschoolers are in a much better position if non-homeschoolers (most likely our opponents) introduce the legislation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="366">Then we can appeal for support as a threatened minority and sometimes get a much better law by having amendments favorable to homeschooling introduced. * The best way to deal with government regulation of homeschooling needs to be worked out by homeschoolers in each state on the basis of the unique history and current situation within that state. Another strategy sometimes suggested by individuals and/or organizations claiming to work to support and protect home schoolers is to deliberately have homeschoolers become involved in test cases in local and state courts. People get to know and understand each other better. They explain their positions to each other and come to a consensus or work out a compromise. Or sometimes they agree to disagree. Ways in which citizens can work effectively are outlined below under "What Homeschoolers Can Do."</paragraph><paragraph parID="367">However, some homeschoolers may have difficulty proving that they qualify for the exemption. In any case, it is very unhelpful to have the certified teacher requirement upheld.) First, it strengthens the state's claim that it has the right to review and approve homeschools. Second, it allows this review and approval to take place in the home. Third, since the case was argued in a federal district court, it may more easily be cited as a precedent in other states. * Homeschoolers cannot afford to assume we will be able to win more court cases once the U.S. Congress passes "The Religious Freedom Restoration Act," which is currently making its way through Congress and which President Clinton promises to sign. * We can appear as conventional as possible to people we do not know well or who may oppose homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="368">* Some homeschoolers prevent difficulties by explaining to neighbors and acquaintances that their children are homeschooled, that they go outside during "school hours" for recess, physical education, nature study, and other such activities. * Some homeschooling court cases arise as part of custody disputes. * Homeschoolers who find that their principles and consciences will not allow them to comply with the homeschooling laws in their state and who therefore choose to practice civil disobedience can greatly reduce their chances of ending up in court. * A small, not well understood minority like homeschoolers can maximize its strength through grassroots organizations. * It can be very helpful to exchange information with homeschoolers working on the grassroots level in their own states. The most important reason parents gave for choosing homeschool was to offer religious or moral instruction (36%). NCES Statistics Homeschooling also list the facts behind other parental reasons, which were:</paragraph><paragraph parID="369">choice of available schools concerns about the school environment (safety, negative peer pressure, drugs, etc.) disappointment with the teaching provided wishing to provide a non-traditional learning experience problems with time, money, or distance from school child health problems or special needs The statistics clearly show that home school students outscore their peers on standardized tests.</paragraph><paragraph parID="370">In the UK , the academic advantage of homeschooling was shown by statistics produced by Paula Rothermel from the University of Durham which proved that: "children at home significantly outperform their contemporaries at school." Further, although their parent's level of education did make a noticeable difference, the homeschooled children of non-college educated parents still scored well above the national average. "Research in the United States suggests that home educated children who eventually enter school are generally ahead of their age mates, sometimes way ahead." Homeschool students, for example, have matriculated at over 900 different institutions, including highly selective Universities like Harvard and Princeton. You might be pleased to learn that many of the skills you already have as a good parent will transfer into turning you into a first-rate homeschooler! Facts And Research on Homeschool Statistics Homeschooling brings together the facts which show why an increasing number of families are choosing homeschool and gives you some of the evidence which proves that home school works.</paragraph><paragraph parID="371">I've looked at the available data and tried to boil things down so you can see at a glance the most useful and relevant homeschooling facts. I've concentrated here on the homeschooling statistics available for the US, but I've also included research results from the UK where the facts, as you'll see, prove the success of homeschooling. Teaching home school science is one way of emphasising the importance of facts to prove a hypothesis, so let's see what comes out of the homeschooling research. Homeschooling Statistics for the US The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) provides homeschool statistics. The home school statistics which follow are for 2007, the most recent year data is available. Homeschooling Facts:</paragraph><paragraph parID="372">Number of homeschool students. NCES Statistics Homeschooling show that numbers for students increased by 74% from 1999 to 2007. In 2007, there were about 1.5 million homeschool students. Homeschool Arrangements. 84% of homeschool students were taught at home exclusively. Of the remaining 16%, most students spent less than 9 hours each week at school. Reasons for Homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="373">Who chooses to homeschool? 77% of all home school children in 2007 were white. Other Homeschooling Statistics More facts are available from the National Home Education Research Institute, which publishes the Home School Researcher. According to NHERI's homeschool statistics published in January 2011, approximately 1.73 to 2.35 million children in grades K-12 were homeschooled in the U.S. during the spring of 2010. Facts show that the homeschool population is growing at the rate of 2-8% annually. NHERI puts the number of nonwhite home school families at about 15% (which largely tallies with the statistics from NCES), an encouraging sign that increasing numbers of minorities may be choosing to homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="374">Facts About Homeschooling How does homeschool affect academic results? The Home School Legal Defense Association published a report, Homeschooling Achievement, looking at research facts on homeschool. The US statistics revealed something else, which has great relevance to homeschool families. The academic achievement for home school students was not dependent upon: Dr Alan Thomas, (Senior Lecturer In Psychology, Darwin, Australia) found that: You can find more evidence of the academic advantage of homeschooling from the UK, and other facts back up the statistics.</paragraph><paragraph parID="375">Overall Statistics: Evaluating Home School Over 90% of those studied are glad they were homeschooled, and over 80% plan to educate their children at home. What a fantastic endorsement of homeschool! Statistics Homeschooling And You I have not attempted here to provide a definitive list of all home school research, but only to have picked out some of the most interesting facts. Nonetheless, the statistics prove that homeschooling is a choice that has been made by a significant and growing number of families. If you're asking yourself whether you're up to the challenge, have a look at our page on Homeschooling for Dummies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="376">HSLDA's Statistics Homeschooling has provided lots of evidence to show that home school does work for a significant number of families. #1- We want to foster a love of learning. Choosing to homeschool or unschool is a personal decision, so therefore these reasons are very personal to us. Sure, some children thrive in a structured school environment - my 4 year old niece is one of them. She loves it, and is blossoming. Since we became a homeschooling/unschooling family - or rather, since we decided not to send our children to school- I have heard a lot of myths about educating children at home. Thankfully I have not had to defend our decision very much as we have a supportive family and live in a generally open-minded community, but I still hear a lot of misconceptions about unschooling and homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="377">Myth #1 - Unschooled Kids Don't Get 'Socialised' enough. This simply isn't necessary to develop a child's social skills, and can indeed hamper those developing skills. One of the many advantages and privileges we enjoy as homeschooling families is the freedom to devote time and energy on what God deems &#147;the good part&#148; of our children&#146;s education: sitting at His feet and learning from Him. Our public schools are not safe places for children. Excited at the prospect of finding lots of relevant information about rocket propulsion, Werner von Braun (a creation scientist) and the history of rocket science, trigonometry links, etc., what I actually found was the cold water bucket of the reality of public education: conflict resolution with unreasonable parents, finding your identity, and comparing the TV and music of the 50's and the 90's. Who knows how many junior and senior high students actually wasted school time on these activities? If &#147;clear language engenders clear thought, and clear thought is the most important benefit of education,&#148; then how can the education establishment, high priests of muddied, illogical language and thought, bestow that which it does not itself possess?</paragraph><paragraph parID="378">&#148;) Manthei shows the worldview foundational to evolution, taught as fact in all public schools, although there is much debate on its feasibility among the most secular of research scientists, is at complete opposites with the Biblical worldview, upon which, by the way, the great discoveries of Newton, Lavoisier, Pasteur, and others were made. One of Jerome&#146;s acquaintances had written him asking for advice on how to educate her daughter. Past &#147;Why We Homeschool&#148; Links According to Gatto, schools have been designed to teach, not academics, but lessons such as confusion, class position, indifference, emotional dependency, and more. Private and charter schools, emulating the same structure as public schools, are not immune. This is why we homeschool. Why We Homeschool We homeschool because of the inefficiency and failure of the federally-controlled public school system to adequately educate our children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="379">Since the passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965, the amount of taxpayer money which has been flushed through the system has risen at an exponential rate, while &#65533;math and reading scores have stagnated, graduation rates have flatlined, and researchers have shown numerous billion-dollar federal programs to be failures. We homeschool because the most influential special interest in the nation, the National Education Association (NEA), is in hyperdrive to influence American politics while "they have failed miserably when it comes to improving education." Furthermore, the NEA is resisting most reform measures which would improve the public education of our children. While this is bad enough, recent research suggests that sexual harrassment of students by school employees is a worse scandal than the Catholic church abuse scandal, with numbers of abused children in the millions . In the face of this new report, the NEA defends its members rather than defending the children forcibly mandated to spend their days under the influence and authority of NEA members. These are only some of the reasons why we homeschool. The stretch is too far for my mind to make, but this news article has made it, and so have the CSS where these parents live: unable to sit still + inattentive in class (in a bored 12-year-old boy) = mental disorder?</paragraph><paragraph parID="380">This is one reason why we homeschool. Dr. Williams says, "This is a vision all too common among today&#65533;s educationists, but there&#65533;s a good reason for it: too large a percentage of teachers represent the very bottom of the academic achievement barrel and as such fall easy prey to mindless and destructive fads." Restoration of Education: The Role of Parents and the Body of Christ www2.whidbey.net/jmboyes/restore. Regardless, if the state were to somehow become &#65533;godly&#65533; in its agenda, the Bible fails to direct parents to delegate the education of their children&#65533;s souls or conscience (sic) minds, into the hands of those outside of family and Church authority. This observation is well worth repeating: The Bible provides absolutely no basis for the contemporary practice of in loco parentis of Christian children, by Christian parents, into the hands of the United States federal/state school system." Are our children going to learn about the biblical foundation of American life and government, as a matter of historical fact, in their public schools? Will our children learn the historical and scientific evidence which agrees with the Biblical account in Genesis of the origin of the universe and earth&#65533;s ancient history in their schools?</paragraph><paragraph parID="381">Will our modern education system prepare our children to be the George Washingtons and James Madisons of the next generation? That is why we homeschool. So, while he typically assigns two papers a semester and asks students to read essays by pacifists such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Leo Tolstoy, and Catholic social worker Dorothy Day, he doesn&#65533;t require them to do anything. Or, from the article: &#65533;In an academic year bookended by snipers terrorizing the Washington, D.C., region and an American invasion of Iraq, it appears that McCarthy was able to accomplish something remarkable with these kids: He sent them off into an uncertain world feeling comfortable with uncertainty. Peace is wonderful, and will only be achieved when the Prince of Peace is Lord; so any paths advocated to peace which eliminate Him as the solution are deceptive; and God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, so is a child comfortable with uncertainty uncomfortable with God? Well, this is one reason we homeschool. But Dr. Moore exposes this association as false: certification does not always equal qualification, and sadly usually does not equal qualification.</paragraph><paragraph parID="382">Our schools are filled with certified teachers, but are they filled with qualified teachers? No, it&#65533;s not for the kids. It&#65533;s for parents, and they have to answer only one question: Do you know what your children are learning in sex-education classes? If you&#65533;re like most parents, the answer is no. But if the program is billed as &#65533;abstinence-based,&#65533; you probably don&#65533;t feel particularly concerned. The important thing, as far as you&#65533;re concerned, is that your kids are being taught to say &#65533;no&#65533; to sex. But are they?</paragraph><paragraph parID="383">The fact is, nearly all of the government-funded abstinence-based or &#65533;abstinence-plus&#65533; programs delivered in schools nationwide contain little, if any, reference to abstinence. Warning: This article contains some explicit references in its report of &#65533;abstinence&#65533; curriculum content. If the description of the curriculum is too explicit for some to read without offense, how then can we expose our children to the full and undiluted curriculum itself? So the places where the progressive crowd congregates and has influence (public schools) has been, well, aggressively pursuing the feminization of our boys, and the masculinization of our girls, in the hope that when the properly trained generation grows up and becomes world leaders, there will be peace and all the nations will forget silly things like territory and everyone will sing Kumbaya together and get along. This loathing of maleness is one reason why the progressive crowd tends to be ashamed of America (all our national heroes are masculine aggressors like Columbus and Washington!) , ashamed of the military (it goes without saying), ashamed of heterosexuality, particularly ashamed of our current "cowboy" president (Texas is such a testosterone place), and why it is trying to get "He" out of the Scriptures as a pronoun for God. This contempt of the male has its roots in the rejection of God as our Lawgiver and Judge - male and female was His idea.</paragraph><paragraph parID="384">It will still take years, I am afraid, for the current progressive crowd in control of our schools to retire and give up on their pet projects and tampering with our sons&#146; masculinity, and that is one reason why we homeschool. &#148; One reason we homeschool is so that our children learn basic skills during their 12 years of home education, and not only basic skills, but proficiency in syntopical reading; concrete, analytical, and abstract thinking; a biblical worldview; and development of virtuous character and a heart tuned toward the Lord. &#148; Caution: the extremes to which the public schools are being used to promote an anti-Biblical agenda is shocking. &#147;When a sharp-eyed parent last year discovered that literary passages on New York state&#146;s high school Regents English exam had been censored to make them more politically correct, state officials endured withering ridicule. Critics were appalled that educators would delete references to God, change &#145;a skinny Italian boy&#146; to &#145;a thin Italian boy,&#146; or &#145;a gringo lady&#146; to &#145;an American lady,&#146; often without writers&#146; permission. The Why of Homeschool www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=1167 By Isabel Lyman, author of The Homeschooling Revolution . &#147;Even in a nation that applauds innovation and liberty, the act of homeschooling continues to raise many uncomfortable, but important, questions about government regulation of private choices.</paragraph><paragraph parID="385">What follows are the seven most frequently asked questions about home education. Hopefully, the answers will explain the benefits of this educational endeavor and dispel common misperceptions. How I Joined Teach for America -and Got Sued for $20 Million www.city-journal.org/html/13_1_how_i_joined.html The story of one young and idealistic Yale graduate&#146;s work in inner city schools. But the deep impression I was left with was a general system of bureaucracy entrenched which tends to punish innovation and enthusiam, the very qualities which make for good teachers, and to reward the status quo or even mediocrity. This isn&#146;t the fault of one school; this is what happens in any bureaucracy, because it is the nature of bureaucracy. Rather than chance our own precious children to the arbitrary and often unwise bureaucratic mechanizations which often go on, we choose to homeschool. &#148; One reason we homeschool is that we want our children to know America&#146;s noble history and to appreciate what it means to be uniquely American.</paragraph><paragraph parID="386">This article attempts to answer that criticism, and shows that more often than not, Christian children in public schools end up being influenced by the godlessness around them, rather than influencing the godless. Homeschooling, if it shakes off the desire to be just like their professional big brothers (who have now failed several generations of children), and grasps the true calling of education: of inculcating virtue in the heart of a child, of giving a child the tools to learn, and introducing him to the Great Minds that have preceded him -- has the opportunity to make a real difference for our children. &#147;Christians have lost the war for America's schools &#150; which have been scrubbed antiseptically clean of the Christian principles and traditions that once guided those institutions, and are now filled instead with every conceivable form of propaganda and perversion. &#148; Christian parents yearly face the question of whether they will give the precious charges in their care over to the discipleship of an institution scrubbed clean of Christian principles and traditions. Homeschooling parents have made the decision to actively disciple their children in Christian principles and traditions without competition from the local government school. &#148; This well-thought out article from the Christian Research Institute illustrates how a current trend in American society which is based on a faulty presumption, in this case, that of affirming that law does not have a foundation in a morality from a greater authority, can be combatted with proper logic and a foundation in a Biblical worldview. Our children need their education to teach them to do the same with the current trends based on faulty presumptions that they will encounter as adults, something that government schools do not do.</paragraph><paragraph parID="387">This is one reason why we homeschool! Rowles makes the point that if your desire is to transmit, then one of the things that you must do is take your children out of public schools, as they are temples to Gramsciism. &#146;&#148; Four to six million children in the United States now take this drug; by far the vast majority are boys; by far the vast majority of children on the drug are taking it because of a recommendation by their public school. We homeschool to avoid the mistakes of educationism, false education, in both government and private schools, in neglecting the teaching of reason to indoctrinate in humanism or Christianism, rather than teaching truth, &#147;difficult disciplines&#148;, and &#147;difficult doctrine&#148;, if we will listen. The family is impacted in a powerful way, as parents seek to obey the biblical injunction to teach their children, and parents and children start having more time to spend together. Family relationships soon take on an importance as great or greater than academic excellence, and because every one is home and around each other much of the time, the potential for closeness as well as conflict is multiplied. Homeschooling combats family fragmentation and is one very important reason why we homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="388">The answers are in Genesis, and because we homeschool, we are free to explore scientific and historic truth that, because it challenges their dogma, the high priests of the educational establishment in America have censored. In the colonial days of our country, the three purposes of schooling were to: make good people, make good citizens, to help children find their talents. And it is the proliferation of that fourth purpose that is one reason why we homeschool. As homeschoolers, we can bypass the defunct dinosaur of a theory all together and teach pure science, unencumbered by the politically correct baggage of the age. By homeschooling, we can ensure that our children learn the nature of the political process and participate in that process, under our guidance. For us this is the only way to go!! We hear stories frequently from them concerning activities that would shock you - all from non-supervisored, peer-to- peer interactions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="389">The old one-room schools always had mixed ages interacting with each other - which is what happens in most home school environments - especially if you are involved with a co-op or enrichment group. There are too many bullies at public schools. ~ because public school is not necessary for "socialization", it is easy to overlook our (own and our children's) very real social needs. Home CAN be a very lonely place. ~ I have recently begun to notice the pendulum swinging from polite, well-behaved homeschooled children to children who have no concept of manners whatsoever: thinking they can have whatever they want as long as they ask, interrupting speakers, etc. We also home-school - and hear the "socialization" question frequently. I am not concerned about Daniel and Sarah receiving sufficient socialization - I am concerned about the amouunt of inappropriate, non-supervisored, peer-to-peer socialization that occurs in the mass education factories of today's educational institutions (and private schools are only moderately better than public in this regard).</paragraph><paragraph parID="390">We have many friends whose children attend public and/or private schools. (Like the time a seven year old girl asked her mother, while standing in line at McDonalds "Momma, since I'm an only child, does that mean Daddy only put his ___ in your ___ one time?" Knowledge she had received from her eight year-old friend while on the school playground. The list could go on and on. Modern, mass-environment, age-segregated, public education has been an invention of the last 150 years - think about it people. When my daughter was reading "Little House" books at age 5, but was required to do reading worksheets in Kindergarten class ("You may not go play until you find the word 'green' and color the leaf,") I knew something had to change. I think home-schooled kids do just as good or better than public/private schooled kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="391">Who wants their kids to "socialize" with them? You have convinced me that school is NOT the only way. School doesen't give you freedom to really think, and i always felt pressure to be like everyone else. I am so different from kids at my school simply because of how i was raised. What I am saying is, Your doing a great thing for your kids, maybe when their older they would like to go to a public school but teaching them at such a young age to think on thier own is the smartest thing you could do. " I'm curious, what is your reason for homeschooling? Is it because you don't want to let go of him?</paragraph><paragraph parID="392">Or maybe you're worried about letting him be around other children? Or maybe you don't want him to be open to views other than your own? I'd really love to hear the reasons you're preventing him from being a normal child and participating in this nation's education system ." My child is still participating in the national education system, just from a different classroom. I have to follow the same regulations and laws of other educational facilities. I have to keep the same records, submit (homeschooling laws vary by state) to the same testing. I just don't believe that public or traditional schooling is the panacea for the ages and I don't believe that it's the best educational approach for every child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="393">Just as homeschooling doesn't work for every family, neither does traditional education. Plus, public schools are different than they were ten years ago. He doesn't look at school work as "work," he looks at class work like it's a fun project. I do not want his desire to learn to be crushed or bogged down by an educational system unable to cater to each individual student (personal attention, talent and skills, and help). Liam showed talent in music early; I don't want a mammoth learning facility to neuter his abilities or gifts because they may lack the ability to provide encouragement. I'm also vehemently against the idea that children should be socialized via schools. Schools are a place for learning, not for institutionalized socialization - which is a reason our schools are a collective battleground in the great ideological war, the adults' war.</paragraph><paragraph parID="394">I don't want my kids caught up in that. Homeschooled kids are not without a plethora of opportunities for socialization. I could plan a playgroup, field trip, or attend an event with my homeschool co-op nearly every day of the year. Liam has soccer practice, he begins karate in a month, piano lessons, attends Sunday school and Wednesday night classes, and enjoys a bi-weekly playgroup; also the neighbor kids are ALWAYS AT MY HOUSE. Homeschooled kids learn quickly how to get along with people of every age, creed, ethnicity, etc. because they have endless opportunities to step outside the box. Homeschooling isn't for every family, every parent, or every kid. It's a personal family choice.</paragraph><paragraph parID="395">My kids aren't freaks because they are/will be homeschooled, they won't grow up to live in a shack and mail letter bombs to people, and I'm not a nutjob. " Why Homeschool? from The Lilting House I always appreciate it when someone who isn't familiar with the real whys and hows of homeschooling takes the time to try to get a handle on the subject. That's what Elizabeth of Table for Five has attempted to do, [Read More] Despite having different religious beliefs than you do, many of the parents in that group have decided to homeschool for almost exactly the same reasons you have: they feel that public schools have become sub-par; they worry that their children's individual talents will be stifled and individual needs ignored in such a regimented cookie-cutter system; and they fear that their children will be upset and confused by ongoing the cultural and theological warfare being waged in public schools by parents and the adults controling the system. Isn't it interesting that people of all sorts of religious backgrounds are choosing to keep their kids out of public school in part because they don't want their children to have to deal with adult-driven cultural and religious discrimination and conflict? Our kids were "socialized" by bullies through the fifth grade in public school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="396">So we are now schooling them at home. I think when someone says, "I've chosen to homeschool" a lot of people seem to hear, "I think you're a real idiot for sending your kids to those gross, rotten cesspools of disease and sin that pass for public schools." I have been considering homeschooling since my first was born and now that he's ready for kindergarten this fall, we are absolutely certain that homeschooling would NOT be the best option for HIM for a variety of reasons. Because we homeschool certainly does not mean we are better or even can protect them from everything. We hope and pray we can meet the needs of our children individually, and work with them wear they are weak, and encourage them even more where they are strong. I'm sure there are parents out there who homeschool for the wrong reasons, or with insufficient resources. But the majority of homeschooling families I've met have been doing an awesome job, have and have polite, well-socialized children who are performing above grade level.</paragraph><paragraph parID="397">I homeschooled my son in first and second grades and loved it. But it is such an individual decision for each family to make, there is no one blanket right answer for all. I think one right answer would be to overhaul our nation's public school system and make the standards for children and those who teach them higher. Our educational system is no longer what it once was. No public school would take her because her attendance would not be funded by the state, and we couldn't afford private school, so we homeschooled her. I then went to the principal of our local public elementary to ask if she could be admitted directly to first grade. The principal was in my church congregation so I knew where she lived.</paragraph><paragraph parID="398">When she didn't return my phone calls I knocked on her door. She tried to explain to me how vastly important it is that children attend Kindergarten and not go directly to first grade, even though they are testing on the second grade level. Her main point was that Kindergarten is for "socialization." I asked her to give an example of the social skills Kindergarten supposedly imparts, and she mentioned the ability to wait your turn. This whole time my daughter was standing quietly by my side, holding her library book and waiting to be called on to speak. The principal went on to complain about how this "socialization" must be necessary because so many people are rude nowadays. By this point I had realized it was useless to try to talk sense into this woman, so I only wondered to myself how many of the rude people she decried had gone to Kindergarten, and what that statistic would say about the efficacy of Kindergarten in teaching people how not to be rude.</paragraph><paragraph parID="399">So, we begin with homeschool relationships. Relationship with God The first and greatest relationship to remember is your relationship with God. Many veterans commented how important it is to seek God's direction and follow Him in your homeschooling. Do not let your desire to succeed in teaching your children hinder your personal relationship with the Lord. Speaking from experience, it is easy to let the demands of the school schedule come before personal time with God. For unknown reasons, we forget where our strength, patience and joy come from and try to succeed on our own.</paragraph><paragraph parID="400">When we do this, we will find ourselves weak, impatient and frazzled. So, nurture your relationship with the Lord. Make sure to set a time to meet with Him. It may not be a "quiet" time with children constantly in the home, but the Lord knows and He will join you. As one veteran said, "Seek God's direction. His grace is sufficient." Relationship with Your Spouse</paragraph><paragraph parID="401">As well as nurturing your relationship with God, you need to nurture your relationship with your spouse. The spouse relationship was mentioned more frequently than any other topic by our veteran homeschoolers. Spouses need to discuss, pray and decide together about homeschooling. Although one parent may do the bulk of the teaching, both parents' attitudes and ideas affect the success of homeschooling. One veteran commented that "Both spouses should be involved in the decision making." Achieving this unity, does not require both spouses to wade through all the materials available to homeschoolers. At this time, I explain the choices to my husband.</paragraph><paragraph parID="402">Together we decide what we believe is best for our children. Relationship with Other Homeschoolers Building relationships with other homeschoolers will also help you through some of the bumps in homeschool life. You can meet other homeschoolers through support groups in your area. Friendships with other homeschoolers can provide encouragement and a wealth of information. You will find that most homeschoolers want to help each other. We have been in your shoes before.</paragraph><paragraph parID="403">If you do not know where the nearest support group is, then search the internet. Homeschool Enrichment's website has a page of support groups that have signed up. You can also try typing in your county and state plus the word "homeschool." Relationships with Opposition Not everyone is supportive of the Homeschool decision. Many who oppose your homeschooling decision may be from within your extended family. I have found that the number one reason for such opposition is because of concern for your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="404">Try to remember this concern as you endure through these relationships. As you choose homeschooling, your mind turns to curriculums, book titles, learning and teaching styles and much more. All of these things are important and will be discussed in future articles in this series. However, veteran homeschoolers again and again have commented that the relationships within their homeschool truly help their families to succeed at homeschooling. If He is leading you to homeschool your children, then IT WILL WORK! Both of you should discuss why you are choosing to homeschool. When you and your spouse are in agreement on these issues, it will help you both remember why it is worth it during tough times.</paragraph><paragraph parID="405">In my home, I research and eliminate until only two or three options are left. Your children can meet new friends and enjoy field trips and activities with others in the support group. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Why are they concerned? Why don't they just trust you? Although homeschooling has gained in popularity in the last thirty years, it is still not the norm. People are afraid of the unknown and they are skeptical of change.</paragraph><paragraph parID="406">It is probably not their distrust in you that sparks their opposition as much as their uncertainty of the outcome. As you homeschool, most opposition within the family subsides as they see the results in your children's lives. Arguing and defending yourself will rarely change their opinion. And as stated above, our anger cannot produce righteousness. Relationship with Your Child Last but not least, your relationship with your child is critical to successful homeschooling. If your child has been a student in a traditional school setting, your spouse and you should meet together with that child to thoroughly explain your homeschooling decision.</paragraph><paragraph parID="407">Allow your child to make comments and answer all questions to the best of your abilities. However, if you are homeschooling a child from the beginning of his/her education, most questions will probably come along the way in their educational journey. As you teach, remember the reasons that you are teaching at home. You will need to firmly require the work to be done but constantly build enthusiasm. Try to avoid pushing so hard that the child dislikes learning. If you allow yourself to enjoy teaching, then your child will probably enjoy learning. One veteran homeschooler explained, "Teach your children to learn to love and to love to learn."</paragraph><paragraph parID="408">Relationships in homeschooling are the most important building blocks for a successful homeschool. Do not allow your relationships to slip in your priorities. As your relationships are nurtured they will grow and you will find encouragement and enjoyment in your homeschool experience. Next, how to get answers to all those homeschooling questions? And those who do know are often tempted to join government homeschooling for the supposed goodies. The bait of free materials or the perception of getting help from "real teachers" seems inviting, but having public school employees overseeing your homeschool dramatically alters the spiritual dynamic of the home. You need to know that there is another form of homeschooling; one that is scriptural.</paragraph><paragraph parID="409">Private biblical homeschooling strengthens God's design for the family and helps ensure the future right of our children and grandchildren to freely homeschool in a Christ-centered manner. Homeschooling has always existed in this country -- from the native Americans to the first Europeans to form colonies in the New World. Yet it was mostly forgotten as state funded schooling, the purpose of which is to create obedient productive citizens, pervaded the land in the 19th century. But in the late 1970's and 1980's, a resurgence in homeschooling began among parents who were mostly Christians. These "pioneer" families often resisted the idea that the state was supposed to control the education of their children. Not only that, but the behemoth of public education was taking a financial hit whenever a child was withdrawn from public school or never entered in the first place. Strategies to stop homeschooling failed, and homeschooling was proven to be legal in all fifty states.</paragraph><paragraph parID="410">But Satan is clever and whenever Christians have fruit, he delivers a strong counter-punch. When a family goes that route, not only is the public school still financially supported, but that family is put under the control of an institution that denies the lordship of Jesus Christ. Spiritual revival of the Christian family is not likely to come out of this humanist matrix. We urge bible-believing Christians to refrain from becoming yoked with government homeschool programs for many reasons, and to instead discover the blessings of a non-government biblical home education: In government homeschooling, you place those who hate God over your homeschool. God is the head of the husband who is the head of the wife. In private homeschooling done biblically, the buck stops with the dad (or mom if there is no dad in that family).</paragraph><paragraph parID="411">If the dad decides he doesn't want his kids taking a certain standardized test, does he have the ultimate authority? If he picks out the textbooks and decides they are to all be Biblical, is he able to do this? If he decides he wants a child of his to skip a certain subject this year to concentrate on another, does he have the power to make that call? Only in private biblical homeschooling does the father have this authority. The public school has long proven itself a producer of the most rotten fruit we see in society today -- so why would a Believer want to prop up a system that is so obviously of the kingdom of darkness? When you enroll in government homeschooling, your child is legally considered a public school student. A bit is kicked back to parents for secular materials.</paragraph><paragraph parID="412">In contrast, a family that chooses private Christian homeschooling can tell their neighbors they are a blessing to taxpayers -- and they do not have to feel guilty about contributing to the delinquency of America. When you take public money for homeschooling, you are not supposed to use Christian curriculum or teach from a Christian worldview during school hours. Since he who controls the curriculum controls the hearts and minds of the children, there is a deliberate push to get all homeschoolers under the control of the public school system. But we need to think about this biblically -- no where in the Word does it say the civil government is to be responsible for keeping believers "accountable" in raising their children. If you enroll in government homeschooling, you are agreeing to follow the agenda of a system that does not recognize Jesus as Lord. In private biblical homeschooling, you follow God's standards. The first set of standards strives to raise up a child loyal to the state, who views all of life from an evolutionary worldview.</paragraph><paragraph parID="413">The other seeks to raise up a child loyal to Jesus, who views all of life from a biblical worldview. Some Christian parents claim they will act like the are following the government standards, but try to outwit them by secretly teaching God's standards and getting the government goodies at the same time. Private biblical homeschooling has a record of outstanding academic and spiritual results -- we urge families not to "go back to Egypt." Satan hates independent Christian homeschoolers precisely because they are raising up a godly generation of young people who are serving Jesus with their whole hearts and minds. By the way, only private homeschoolers are eligible for membership in the Home School Legal Defense Association, an organization that not only protects your family's right to homeschool, but helps protect the rights of homeschoolers in every state. We see biblical homeschooling as a Christian family restoration movement. Shouldn't you have a Holy Spirit led homeschool instead of a public school led one?</paragraph><paragraph parID="414">Look at the spiritual state of your family and consider the long-term consequences for future generations of Christian homeschoolers. Instead of becoming a dependent on government educational handouts, become an advocate of protecting our God-given rights to give our children a biblical education, free from government control. Once parents are under the control of the public school system -- whether it be in a brick and mortar school or a government homeschooling program -- they are often fearful to leave even when they see the problems with it. Discover the blessings of a non-government controlled, private biblical home education. It is about preserving our parental rights over what curriculum to use, testing decisions, what subjects to teach and how -- not just for us -- but for our children's future right to homeschool our grandchildren in a 100% Christ-centered way. Factors that Affect the Amount of Time Parents Need to Commit in Home Schooling Parents who commit to homeschooling do so for a variety of reasons. Nearly half believe they can give their children a better education at home, others have religious reasons or consider the learning environments at their local schools to be of poor quality.</paragraph><paragraph parID="415">What kind of record keeping is required for homeschooling Homeschooling, for those who are asking, is legal. As of now, fifty states have allowed homeschooling and have provided laws for its implementation. They have different laws though and some of the states require that you can show some kind of records to show that you&#65533;re homeschooling your children. There are several ways you can keep record of your children&#65533;s progress and here are some of them. Daily Lesson Plans Daily lesson plans show what subjects you have taught to your children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="416">They will also show the way your children&#65533;s lessons are progressing (from basic to intermediate to advanced). These lesson plans could be important for school officials to learn what could be lacking from your schooling and in what area they could help you with. Teachers could also help you with lessons that could be a good primer for the next and more advanced level of any subject. Time spent for each subject is an indication of what subjects you have focused on and what subject your children might be having some problem absorbing. Although this is not an accurate basis, this could be used to understand problem areas and reasons why your children are having an easy (or tough) time on their subjects. Diaries and Journals Updated Regularly Regular diary and journal entries of your children&#65533;s achievements (or failures) are a good way to keep a record of your homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="417">This can prove helpful in two ways. The first is you can keep track of what areas your children have already studied. This will prove beneficial in monitoring your children&#65533;s progress with their lessons. The second way it can help is that it will help you in knowing where your children are having an easy time and where they need more time and attention. This is important so you could focus on one subject if you think your children need it. It is simple to create or copy a test or exercise from one of the books your children use. Results from these exams can be compiled and recorded.</paragraph><paragraph parID="418">These, just like any other records, can be proof of your children&#65533;s achievements. Grades are more concrete records of your children&#65533;s progress and concrete proof if someone wants to look at your children&#65533;s records. Grades also give your children a sense of achievement. This will help in building their characters and giving a boost in their egos. Failures can also help, too. You just have to handle their feelings carefully and make sure that they realize that they can make their failures as stepping stones to success. Portfolios</paragraph><paragraph parID="419">Portfolios are a collection of your children&#65533;s works, from their exercises to their tests and anything that they have done while schooling. For your younger children, these could include the first time they write a letter or the whole alphabet. Included in their portfolio are their mathematical computations and other exams. For your older children, this could include pictures from recent field trips to museums and other historical trips. Other things that could be included are science tests and experiments and, if possible, a picture of your children&#65533;s science projects. Standardized Tests A standardized test performed by an authorized school official could be a good way to let the government know if you&#65533;ve been schooling your child at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="420">These tests will show what subjects your children are having any problems with. Results from these exams (even if your children fail) will not really be a gauge of the success of your homeschooling. These tests would let school officials know how to help you with regards to subjects your children are having difficulty with. There are several reasons why you would want your children to take a standardized test. The first reason is given above. These tests will let you know what subjects your children are having some difficulty with. Another reason is to gauge your children&#65533;s abilities and knowledge compared with people their age.</paragraph><paragraph parID="421">These will help in knowing whether your children are advanced, late or at just the right level in respect to other children. This could help you in deciding what your next approach to your children&#65533;s lessons you will take. Although homeschooling have many advantages you must be sure you can full commit in your children home schooling. This article introduce you with factors inluencing on your time spent with your children. Read more:  Commit in home schooling I. Teaching is fundamentally an act of humility. Responsibility is fundamentally an act of humility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="422">Husbands are to love their wives as Christ loves the Church. If we are to imitate Christ, then trying to be a good teacher is not a bad place to start. We teach from love, and we also teach on faith-the faith that maybe because of us, and probably in spite of us, our students take what is good and true into their souls. Any good and true education comes with tears. To become truly educated is the result of many moments of repentance. Thus, homeschooling fathers not only teach their children the topic at hand-whether it is math, science, writing, or whatever-but homeschooling fathers must also, and always, teach humility by the example they set. To improve your child's academic performance</paragraph><paragraph parID="423">To influence your child's life and education To develop a richer relationship with your child To ensure your child's special needs are being met Other reasons (or maybe all of the above) Choosing Homeschooling Choosing to homeschool your children is a gift of time, talent, and future possibilities. There may also be a million reasons that families have chosen to homeschool their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="424">The decision to homeschool is an important one that requires lots of thought and planning. Throughout our history, we have learned that homeschooling requires a family commitment to be successful. Below are some questions that families typically answer before starting to homeschool. What are your reasons for homeschooling? Calvert provides a free evaluation for older students to let you know where your child would be most successful in our program. As home schooling has grown in popularity, the number of support groups in local communities has skyrocketed. These support groups can provide additional resources, play days, workshops, social events for parents, or a wide variety of other activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="425">I am a slow starter and need time in the morning. It can be math games, writing things, or other. The rest of the day is play, going out in the garden, the woods, going to library once or twice a week. Or it can be more "schoolwork" (still not called so) because the children ask for it. As you can hear, we do child-led education, inspired by other families, Waldorf homeschooling, by each other, and by things around us, of course. We play many games to learn, and we make a lot of our material ourselves. We do what we like and feel for, but also some things that the school demands us to.</paragraph><paragraph parID="426">I mean, a seven-year-old does now what a thirteen-year-old does in school, and of course the other way around - some things seven-year-old kids do in school, a homeschooled kid maybe does a year or two later. But I felt fortunate in being able to learn about two families whose homeschooling experiences were so different - though like all homeschoolers, their common bond is a simple wish to give their children the best lives, the best education, and the best childhood possible. Sadly, it's a rather vicious circle: very few families homeschool, so there's little public awareness of homeschooling as a viable alternative to public school, so very few families homeschool. Exact numbers are difficult to get, but according to MATS (My Alternative To School, a Swedish homeschooling association), the number of homeschoolers in Sweden is in the double digits. Lennart Mogren, a teacher in Sweden who is interested in homeschooling as a viable alternative to Sweden's public schools, puts the number at "100 kids being homeschooled." "There's No Place Like Home," a site which until recently offered information about homeschooling in Sweden, claimed that there are roughly 200 homeschooling families, about half of whom are doing so outside of the law. Once I was able to interview some Swedish homeschoolers and learned more about the legal, cultural, and social reality of homeschooling in Sweden, I could completely understand why some would either choose or feel compelled to fly under the legal radar.</paragraph><paragraph parID="427">Homeschoolers in Sweden must apply for permission to homeschool every year, whether this is their first year homeschooling or their tenth. As is the case in America, people unfamiliar with homeschooling in Sweden seem to have grave misgivings about homeschooled children having opportunities for healthy social activity. The application to homeschool takes it as a given that the children will "abide by the Swedish curriculum," and that there will be a certain amount of oversight to assure that this continues to be the case. The application to homeschool also has a space for the parents to "describe how it is possible for one parent to be at home with the child in home education." "There's No Place Like Home" mentioned that one of the reasons homeschooling is so unusual in Sweden is that the tax system makes it difficult for families to be able to afford to have one parent stay at home. "Many parents have an economic problem [with homeschooling], because our society is built on the idea that both parents are working," she told me. Both the parents I spoke to mentioned that many Swedish people don't even know homeschooling is legal in their own country.</paragraph><paragraph parID="428">After only some months in school he totally changed. He didn't like school at all. He had been very interested in maths, and now he had no interest left. I realized we had to do something! I searched the Internet and realized that I could homeschool! Now they said that our kids were in third and fourth grade, and the municipality meant that it was to hard to homeschool now. I started to call different municipalities in Sweden and found a place where they said they had good experience of homeschooling families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="429">My kids say that the best thing with homeschooling is that they can work effectively and then have more free time to play and do whatever they like. As you understand, we have just gotten started, but we are looking forward to developing our homeschooling more and more, now that we can work in peace. And I've never had to ask permission to homeschool - or go to court, not just once but many times, to get that permission. Jenny Lantz, whose three children have all been homeschooled from day one, had an easier time of it legally: Well, although the situation for homeschoolers in Sweden is harsh, we had no problems to get the permission needed to homeschool. We contacted the head of schools in our municipality for a meeting, talking friendly with him with our kids present, and explaining our will to homeschool. Much of her next paragraph could have been written by any American homeschooler, so familiar did it sound:</paragraph><paragraph parID="430">When we tell people we homeschool, their first reaction is often "Is that allowed???" But then, after our explaining and talking about the subject, many people change their mind and get more positive about homeschooling. But I dare to say that EVERYONE, and especially those who know NOTHING about homeschooling, has got strong opinions about it. Many also believe that only Christian fundamentalists homeschool, because they don't want Darwin and sex education for their children. Jenny's reasons for wanting to homeschool were very much like my own, and like those of many homeschoolers I know: When our first son was born we felt strongly that we wanted to carry him close, nurse on demand and listen to his needs. When he grew up we felt just as strongly that we did not want him at day care, but wanted to keep him home, keeping the family together.</paragraph><paragraph parID="431">Then we saw how much he learned by himself, and what a social boy he became, all by himself, and understood that this was his best way of learning and thriving. Then we also got in contact with families who homeschool their kids, and we suddenly knew that this was what we wanted too, and what we already do. She went on to describe a homeschooling day that sounded a lot like mine, especially her feelings about mornings: Is homeschooling the culprit or is this a case of bad parenting? Homeschool basically means that a child is not publicly schooled by a government-run facility using a government-approved curriculum. A homeschooling family might choose to homeschool for many reasons. Both homeschooled and publicly schooled children can have it bad at home..." ( letter continues )</paragraph><paragraph parID="432">A homeschooling issue or a parenting issue? The unfortunate and very sad story that aired on CBS News on October 13 had nothing to do with homeschooling really - but I understand homeschooling was mentioned repeatedly. I don't know if you caught this on the news or not, but it portrayed a bad picture of homeschooling. I'll let you be the judge. It is sure to cause a ruckus in the homeschooling world. NCHE's stand "Well, after watching it I got upset.</paragraph><paragraph parID="433">It only lasted about 5 minutes and there will be more tomorrow. I felt the need to write in so I did. I will post it below. I hope I made sense due to my trying to clear out all my thoughts at once with them." Cari "We are a homeschooling family in the state of Texas. We are considered to be a private school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="434">We have been homeschooling for nearly 6 years now. We watched the first part of the evening news report on the "Darkside of Homeschooling." We were amazed at the way it sounded as though you were implying that 'where you school your children could have an effect on whether they might be abused or even killed.' I am almost sure you are aware that a child can be homeschooled at home, at a co-op, at a public building, outside, in a hotel, or in a church building... There are many more places giving the fact that the world is one's classroom. Everyone in this world is learning everyday from the world around them. The term homeschooled is used loosely. Religion, poorly-ran and or poorly-kept public schools, health, disability, and curriculum are just a FEW of those reasons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="435">There are many more. We chose to homeschool due to our child's health (lethargy from radiation and chemotherapy) and due to the end results of EACH public school day that she attended. Expanding upon the latter, our child went to public school for all of first grade and half of second grade. The kids were not like her in that they hit and stepped on her, broke her glasses, said mean things to and about her, kept themselves away from her in the form of cliques, and stole from her. Keep in mind these are lower level elementary grade children. At the end of each public school day we would pick her up. First thing as always we would ask her how the day went.</paragraph><paragraph parID="436">She told us each bad thing that happened to her and other kids. She told us about the things that were said, which generally shocked us. And as always, about what she learned... "I don't remember." Ever hear a kid answer with that? But imagine what they do remember! After months of tears from our child, and disbelief on our part, we decided that it would help her to do her work at home where she could get the extra catnaps she was in need of and where she could be in an environment that was loving and good. We are sorry that we put her through all of that.</paragraph><paragraph parID="437">And we know there are many more children who go through these horrible treatments daily and are not fortunate enough to be taken out of public school. Today, with one on one schooling at home, at the library, at the gym, in hotels while traveling to visit the place we are learning about, our children are enjoying school and doing well! They attend gym classes with other homeschooled students as well as field trips, fun outings, and events. The homeschooled children we participate with are well-mannered children who can even be found to be nurturing to their own younger siblings. They treat each other well, use nice language, and speak about subjects that parents would approve of. They do not mistreat the children they participate with and do not speak ill of them. Although initially it was difficult for me to take the road less travelled, somewhere along the way, being "homeschoolers" became a part of my identity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="438">Yet I'm pleased with how well the boys are doing so far and how easily they've slipped into an entirely new way of schooling. Yet now, despite the fact that he's making the transition so well, he's condemning us for homeschooling them in the first place! He told Tymon that he was considering homeschooling his own children and asked what he'd thought of homeschooling. Homeschooling allowed each of us to become who we are today. Michele's Musings: Upon Christian Homeschooling From Homeschool to School...For Mom (Part 3 of a 3-part series) The transition from homeschool to school seems to be more of an adjustment for me than for our two teenage sons, attending school for the first time in their lives. Although I had the entire summer to get used to the idea of Asher going to school for grade 8, being relieved of my homeschooling duties regarding our other son caught me totally off guard.</paragraph><paragraph parID="439">For a variety of reasons that I've already shared in previous articles, we enrolled 14-year-old Tymon in a few afternoon classes at a nearby high school. Basically, we wanted to give him a taste of traditional education in grade 9 so he could make a more informed decision regarding the rest of his high school years. Tymon didn't share the same curiosity about school that his younger brother, Asher, had. Yet, after three weeks of afternoon classes, Tymon decided to go fulltime and I found myself out of a job. As with most things in life, our new lifestyle is a mixed bag of benefits and drawbacks. Although it's a relief to not be shouldering all of the responsibility of educating our boys, I'm experiencing somewhat of an identity crisis. For the past nine years I was a "homeschool mom".</paragraph><paragraph parID="440">My role was important and somewhat prestigious. Unlike the boys, who claim to want to feel "normal", I've enjoyed standing out from the crowd. Without the homeschooling part I am now only "mom". I've lost my purpose...to help the boys become all God created them to be. However, there are still plenty of opportunities to stay involved with our boys' education even though they're away from home for 7 hours a day. So far, I've attended a parent meeting about "Outdoor School" and an "Open House" at Tymon's high school; volunteered in the kitchen for a full day at "Outdoor School"; helped Tymon with homework and corrections and read and signed countless forms. At Asher's school I've attended a "Goal Setting" meeting and a family BBQ; volunteered for a field trip to The Science Center; donated hoards of paper we'd collected from the school board throughout our years of homeschooling; and signed his agenda noting that he's kept up with homework assignments.</paragraph><paragraph parID="441">Having the boys in school has been much busier than having them home...at least in recent years when they haven't wanted to attend the many group events offered by our homeschooling community. At times I feel too busy to take on another job, despite the fact that my day mainly consists of menial household tasks, afternoon walks, and talkshows. But I lack the fulfilment my role as a homeschool mom offered. My feelings fluctuate between bubbles of joy and windows of depression, loneliness, and boredom. I'm sure there are plenty of creative things I could do to keep myself busy and satisfied with my lot in life, but a lack of money has always been such a source of stress in our lives that getting another job is a priority right now. Ted's job as a teacher's assistant and my two shifts as a hair dresser have never been enough to keep monthly bills paid, food in the cupboards, gas in our vehicles, and clothes on our backs. We've had to rely on the help and generous support of family to keep up.</paragraph><paragraph parID="442">It's time to find myself a "day job" because my desire is to be home when the boys are home but be able to contribute financially while they're away. Because of the hours, my experience homeschooling, and prior experience working with young offenders, I've applied at the school board to be a teaching assistant like my husband, working with students with behaviour problems. My hope is to eventually be hired fulltime, although a half time position or even a spot on the sub list would be a good start. It's a blessing to be freed up to add to our income, but the road ahead is unclear and will certainly be challenging. Between school fees, backpacks and supplies, clothes and gym shoes, fieldtrips, pictures, social events, and possibly bus passes, we have already spent more than we used to invest in homeschooling each year. We've always been fortunate enough to borrow or buy used textbooks and find most of what we needed on the Internet or at the library. If I didn't have to work for any other reason, paying for the "extras" of school would be reason enough!</paragraph><paragraph parID="443">Despite the fact that they balked at anything too "school-ish" when we were homeschooling, they seem to enjoy the challenge of school. Because Tymon jumped into some of his classes late, he had 3 weeks of math assignments to catch up on which he completed in one day! He worked diligently for about 8 hours to complete all the review worksheets his classmates had done since school began and got 90% of it right! I was so proud of him and amazed by what he accomplished, but I was also somewhat miffed by his willingness to "perform" for his new teachers when he did the absolute minimum for me when I was his teacher. Asher too, is doing well in his classes... as expected. He has very little homework and gets mostly A's, has one or two A+'s, and a B in math, which he's always considered his weakest subject. His teacher described him as "mature" and says she appreciates his valuable input in class discussions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="444">It's fun to be their cheerleader instead of the "bad guy" all the time. I relish hearing about their lessons and seeing their work. I enjoy helping them with homework, yet feel free to step away if they start getting "snarly" with me (because now their schoolwork is their problem, not mine.) I'm relieved to not have the pressure of teaching them higher level maths and sciences. (I was dreading doing Algebra with Tymon!) I love it when they share their experiences. I get a kick out of seeing them challenged in areas they weren't being challenged in at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="445">And I no longer consider them to be wasting time. But I also feel hurt when they shun my interest in what they're doing and don't want me to look over their work. I miss spending time with them. I fear "losing them to the world". I have less control over what they're exposed to both inside and outside of the classroom. And, I'm disappointed in Tymon's overall negative attitude about being homeschooled up to this point. Although we gave both boys the choice to go to school throughout our homeschooling journey, and sometimes I even threatened to enroll them against their will, Tymon consistently refused to even consider it an option.</paragraph><paragraph parID="446">I also think that he carried within him a fear that he wouldn't be able to handle school. He was a late reader, is a terrible speller, and just doesn't like to conform. But homeschooling didn't make him that way...it just allowed him to stay that way. But he blames us for that, despite what felt to me like constant pushing and prodding, trying to make him do enough. The other day a substitute teacher overheard him telling another student that he'd been homeschooled until this year. Tymon told him, "Don't do it!" Lastly, I feel like we're disappointing other homeschoolers because we seem to be going against everything we've come to believe, with the boys now being in school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="447">I also struggle with the gap between my assumptions about homeschooling and the reality of our lives. But I don't regret one minute of homeschooling both of our boys all these years. I don't know what the future holds, but I think that for our family, during these teen years, school is the right option for this leg of our journey. For the boys, the transition from homeschool to school couldn't be smoother. Now I just need to get myself in gear. In fact, I (the editor) think that in many situations homeschooling can provide the best of all possible educations, when all things are considered. MOTIVATION &amp; LIFELONG LEARNING - "Sir William Haley said, 'Education would be much more effective if its purpose was to ensure that by the time they leave school every boy and girl should know how much they do not know, and be imbued with a lifelong desire to know it.'</paragraph><paragraph parID="448">Becoming a life-long learner, that's something that seems to come naturally to most homeschoolers no matter the homeschooling method used by their parents. Homeschooling is just that much more personal and the education derived is a personal education. SOCIALIZATION - by Rebecca Kochenderfer (editor of Homeschool.com) - Home School Teachers Lounge - == Myths (Christine Web) - ERIC Digest - The "S" Word &amp;amp; links by Ann Zeise   /   Minimizing Damage to a Child's Self-Image:  Whether it occurs due to a teacher (with overly harsh evaluations) or other students (on playground or in lunchroom), your child's self-image can be damaged by the "socialization" that occurs in public schools. This personal pain can happen more easily in a public school setting, compared with homeschooling, because you are highly motivated to focus your efforts on the overall personal edification of your children. A public school teacher can "help repair any damage to a child's self-esteem" but you can be proactive in doing what you can to prevent this damage. Homeschooling Curriculum for the Gifted Child The desire to provide optimal and appropriate educational challenges has prompted many parents to consider homeschooling their gifted children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="449">rigor is difficult to measure objectively, but lack of rigor or challenge in school is one of the primary reasons parents cite for homeschooling their gifted children. This article provides an informational site to which parents may be referred to investigate possibilities should they consider home schooling their children. Readers should also see Gifted Homeschoolers Forum , chock full of resources and with a helpful mailing list; and join the national mailing list for gifted homeschooling, TAGMAX (see The TAG Project , and click "Mailing Lists.") If the motivations are all negative-frustration with a teacher, fear of losing control of a child's environment, unhealthy competitiveness-parents might need to reexamine their reasons for homeschooling and take a more positive approach. short- and long-term educational goals: while the child's strengths and interests are key, education should broaden, not limit, opportunities. Our daughter is a talker and learns by telling herself what she needs to know. One can't just pick up a child out of school and take her off for a month or two and then return her expecting everything to work as it did when she left.</paragraph><paragraph parID="450">The lesson doesn't work if I talk to her, she needs to hear herself tell herself. Of course this may happen after I teach her the lesson or may happen before I get there. Either way, her voice seems to be a necessary ingredient. Can you see this happening in a classroom? Neither can I, at least not without problems. Our second reason involves my husband. He is 17 years older than I, retired, and loves to travel.</paragraph><paragraph parID="451">Schools frown on this habit. We have always homeschooled, and she is ready to learn from whatever situation presents itself. One day she was late getting home once again, and I told her she needed to think about how to prevent that from happening. Teaching is not punishing. We look at homeschooling as a way to teach our daughter skills she will need to be a successful adult, and we have been honest with her about our motivation. Knowing how to cook a meal from scratch is as important as being able to discuss the Magna Carta or change the oil in the car or solve a polynomial equation, in my estimation. In a large classroom, the educator is not able to give each student the individual attention required for the students to excel.</paragraph><paragraph parID="452">Parents not only know their pupils on a personal level, they are able to provide one-on-one interactions while teaching. Parents who choose to home school also have the option of choosing the curriculum. Real-life experiences can be taught out of the classroom, such as: managing money, woodworking, cooking, and shopping on a budget. Home school hours are often shorter than traditional school hours, as there is less time not spent on academic subjects. When unnecessary writing, waiting for recess and lunch, and waiting in lines is cut out from the day, must homeschooling parents can complete the coursework in two to three hours per day. Accredited home schools typically have the same curriculum of those of public school. Many parents choose accredited programs so that their child is receiving the same education as other children of their age, but at their own pace.</paragraph><paragraph parID="453">Parents and students are also able to telephone their teachers to receive additional help. Another similar option is a pre-packaged curriculum. Other homeschooling options include online learning. Homeschooling for High School Making the decision to begin homeschooling your high school student can be difficult and should not be taken lightly. High school homeschooling requires personal sacrifice and a big time commitment. It may also be a financial strain on the parents and reduce your child's socialization.</paragraph><paragraph parID="454">However, homeschooling highschool students does have its advantages. Learn more about homeschooling for high school students, its advantages, disadvantages, and how a student can complete his coursework and obtain a diploma from home. Given the advances in education over the past century, many parents may be concerned about the advantages of homeschooling over traditional schooling. High school homeschooling has increased in popularity due to several reasons. Despite the numerous advantages of homeschooling, there are several disadvantages that should be addressed. The most significant disadvantages for many parents is the time and finance that homeschooling requires on a consistent basis. Time is needed to prepare the curriculum, lesson plans, and activities, as well as teach, and organize field trips.</paragraph><paragraph parID="455">This type of set-up may not work well with some families, as parents have little time for themselves. Another major disadvantage of high school home school is the cost. Parents are primarily responsible for purchasing the curriculum and any costs that field trips and other activities average, as opposed to free public schooling. The final disadvantage of homeschooling high school students is their lack of social interaction. When separated from their peers, they are not always able to form friendships with kids their own age. This may not be a problem with all homeschooling families, as long as the student has ample opportunities to spend time with other teenagers. Completing Coursework</paragraph><paragraph parID="456">There are some instances where a child cannot or does not attend regular public or private schools. For this reason, there are several options for parents who want to home school high school students. These provide a chosen curriculum of lesson plans, activities, and developmental skills that will be required for your students' age group. This may include an online classroom environment with other students or one-on-one tutoring from a professional home-school educator. Obtaining a Diploma There are many ways that home school students can obtain a high school diploma. Parents decide when their child has mastered the curriculum that they have set-up.</paragraph><paragraph parID="457">Some parents choose a more structured curriculum, similar to that of a public or private school, while other parents teach their children until they feel that they have reached the point of readiness for college. Getting your actual diploma can be done in a variety of ways. Some parents decide to make their own. Others decide to order from a company that provides high school diplomas for private and home school students. Those who choose accredited online or campus-based schools can typically obtain their diploma from the school directly. Each of these options will depend on personal options, but are all legal and count as valid high school diplomas.

Importance of Homeschooling benefits of homeschooling Education is the parents&#146; responsibility. So what do our reasons for homeschooling have to do with classical homeschooling?</paragraph><paragraph parID="459">Plenty. All of us have probably read or heard discussed the idea that &#147;regular&#148; homeschooling is okay for average parents, but classical education requires the cut above; that classical homeschooling higher than the grammar stage may be something of an oxymoron. Is that true? Are our reasons for homeschooling applicable to all forms of education except for classical education? I believe not. Parents as Teachers Let&#146;s go back to this: God designated parents to do the job of teaching.</paragraph><paragraph parID="460">We can look at this statement the normal way, the way most of us are used to looking at it: that parents are the ones responsible before God to provide a superior education, usually through coming up with the big bucks to have the top-flight professionals to do the job. This assumes almost automatically that top-flight professionals are betters educators of children than parents, solely on the grounds of their level of familiarity with their subject matter. Or we can look at it this way: that God ordained parents to be the teachers of their children, because parents are the best teachers of their children. You are the best teacher for your child, and your neighbor is the best teacher for his child, and I am the best teacher for my child. Not because of our education or lack thereof; not because of our conformance to man-made qualifications or lack thereof; but because we are our child&#146;s parent, because of our position, not our familiarity with some subject matter. We would not dream of having a quarrel with the idea that our husbands are our best providers and protectors because of their position, not their qualifications. They are tied to us by inseparable bonds; they have a wonderful, mysterious, holy relationship with us.</paragraph><paragraph parID="461">It would be ludicrous to have our neighbor be our provider just because he makes more money. The fulfillment of the job of providing and protecting is our husband&#146;s because he is our husband, and has nothing to do with how much money he makes. In the same way, parents have the job of teaching their children. We have this job because of the inseparable bonds with which we are bound to them, because of our position as their parents. It has nothing to do with qualifications or knowledge. We have a wonderful, mysterious, and holy relationship with our children that makes us particularly and singularly right for the job of teaching, not just any children, but our children. It would be ludicrous to have our neighbor teach our children just because he has more knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph parID="462">The fulfillment of the job of teaching is ours because we are the parents, and has nothing to do with how educated we are ourselves. Content and Delivery Although formula will sustain our babies, why do they thrive on mother&#146;s milk when mother&#146;s milk has been chemically analyzed and duplicated in ingredient and proportion in formula? I believe it is because there is more to nurturing than content , than x amount of ounces of milk in his tummy to provide x amount of calories for physical sustenance. There is delivery too, and the nurturing and feeding of a little one&#146;s heart and soul that goes on while he is nursing from his mother is of great importance. This principle of content and delivery is a vital one. A child from a destitute but loving home will be infinitely happier than a child from a wealthy but cold one.</paragraph><paragraph parID="463">This is such basic common sense that it seems ridiculous to even mention it. But it is true because delivery is as important as content, and this case would suggest that it is even more so. There is more to learning than content as well. Delivery plays an important role. And learning within the family, from the parents, from the God-ordained root of life, learning and nourishment for the young saplings around our table, cannot be downplayed as to its importance. Now that we have established our grounds for homeschooling, we have the delivery end of the equation set on solid footing. What about the content end?</paragraph><paragraph parID="464">We chose classical education for our children because it is the best method out there for producing truly educated individuals. But then, because the subjects of the curriculum are rigorous and specialized (Latin, Great Books, Logic and Rhetoric are not something to be picked up off the street, after all, like auto mechanics or waitressing might be) we parents (and everyone else) may feel that in this case it would be better to have the experts at the institution do the teaching; in other words, we feel that content should take precedence over delivery. Is it really true that for classical education, at least, the amount of knowledge, the familiarity with the subject matter, the content, should reign supreme? After all, of the two, content or delivery, which one is easier to make up? Content, of course; but the years that we have with our children while they are under our care and open to our influence are limited - there is a definite window of opportunity that can never be made up once closed. We believe at CCH that parents that homeschool for any length of time at all are benefiting their children, and parents that homeschool through high school, yes, even with classical education, are benefiting their children immeasurably more. Classical Content</paragraph><paragraph parID="465">However, I do not mean to give the impression that content is unimportant. Content is important, especially in classical education. If a parent is lacking in their own education, they have a responsibility to continue their education, so that they can do the job of teaching even better. A student will not be greater than his teacher, so the teacher has the responsibility to be as great as he can be, with the help of the Lord. But this is a doable thing. As parents, we can learn and educate ourselves. The articles on this website are here for that purpose: introducing the subjects to provide a sign-post for further research; outlining the subjects to help parents determine their strengths and weaknesses, for the purpose of knowing where to supplement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="466">The greatest teachers in the world, in the form of the Bible and the other great books, are available in any bookstore for any parent to read. Parents can purchase texts and teach themselves. They can take continuing education classes through the local university or take internet tutorials themselves as an adult student. Parents can pool their resources with other parents while still remaining at the center of life and learning for their children, through co-ops, enrichment classes, and so on. Internet tutorials, such as with Schola Classical Tutorials or Escondido Tutorial Service are a promising, promising solution to the dilemma of content: the highest quality content right in our own homes, the highest quality delivery; truly the best of both worlds. Classical homeschooling is not an oxymoron, but a viable, vigorous reality. It is the prayer of CCH that we can be of service to parents in making it a viable, vigorous reality for their homes and families as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="467">Some Final Considerations All of the above is our opinion based on our own family, experiences, understanding of Scriptures, and walk with the Lord. Just as, I feel, we have to be careful in discouraging parents that have chosen to homeschool their children classically, we should be just as careful in discouraging parents that have chosen to send their children to a local school. We cannot judge how our neighbor educates his children, only how God has called us to educate ours. If any of us feel convicted to homeschool even with good private schools in the area, then we are responsible to follow that conviction. And if any of us feel convicted to have the private schools in the area educate our children, then we are responsible before God to follow that conviction. It is before a parent&#146;s own Master that he stands or falls.</paragraph><paragraph parID="468">But I felt compelled to speak out on this subject, as parents that have chosen to homeschool their children classically have been discouraged, and many still struggle with feeling that it is the second-best choice. This is simply not so. Yes, classical education is rigorous, and no, it is not outside of the province of parents. Parents that are parenting and schooling in accordance with the Scriptures and against the norms of society should be commended and encouraged, rather than be discouraged because we don&#146;t all have degrees from Classical U. If there are other ways that CCH can encourage parents that are homeschooling classically, please contact us. *Genesis 18:19, Deuteronmony 4, 6, 11, Psalm 34, 78, Proverbs 1:8-9; 4, 23:26, Isaiah 38:19, Ephesians 6:4. Homeschooling today, in a modern and technologically aware environment is the doorway to the future, not to the past.</paragraph><paragraph parID="469">If we can prove that homeschooling is a better choice today, then there is no reason to bring back the past, and we can instead appreciate our educational history, as the path of existence that let us be where we are today, and walk through the door to the future. Diverse homeschoolers with children as young as preschool age, all the way up to high school age, from a varied religious (or not) and cultural backgrounds will join Tammy Takahashi and Hunt Press in a festival of games, food, and camaraderie. Compulsory schooling hasn't been around all that long; only 150 years or so. Before this time, children were educated in many ways, including tutors, private schools, and learning through living. public school was not the default choice like it is today. It took less than five generations for public school to become the "norm," after thousands of generations of human evolution when this institution did not exist.
