  <paragraph parID="0">The French Government has enacted a law making smoking illegal in public areas and in workplaces since January 2007. The ban will be extended to restaurants and caf&#233;s in 2008. This law, aiming to reduce the number of smokers and passive smoking appears to gain a surprising support in public opinion. While it is too early to make an assessment of its effectiveness, we already note a significant increase in sales of nicotine-replacement drugs and in physician consultations to quit smoking. In November 2006, the French Government banned smoking in all public areas by enacting and improving a former law on that issue ( Loi Evin , 1991) which has been applied only partially. This law had effectively banned smoking in some public places (in public transports and in some parts of schools, hospitals, etc.) but the major requirements of this law, such as creating non smoking areas in restaurants and caf&#233;s, were never applied appropriately. The new law aimed to fight passive smoking and to prevent especially adolescents from starting to smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">Workplaces and schools have been particularly targeted by this policy. The law considerably reinforced the existing health and safety legislation of smoking at work. Firms are obliged to forbid smoking in all workplaces, to close the existing smoking rooms in the buildings or, at least, to fit out a smoking room in accordance with a strict sanitary scheme (rooms with smoke fume extractors). It is worth noting that the application of the law at the workplace is not always straightforward and changes the work habits of employees. Workers unions are also quite sensitive about a potential discrimination between smokers and non smokers in the same company. In schools, the government reinforced the fight against children's and teenagers' smoking by extending the ban to schoolyards and all outdoor parts of schools. This measure is in line with previous policies that strictly regulated tobacco packaging and selling in order to reduce smoking habits of young people.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">Tobacco selling to teenagers under 16 is no longer allowed since 2003; and in 2001 the small packs of ten cigarettes were withdrawn from the market as they were particularity attractive for young people. The ultimate objective is to prevent passive smoking, especially for children, and to reduce the prevalence of smoking as a common behaviour. A total ban on smoking is introduced/reinforced in all types of public places, with a particular emphasis on workplaces, schools and public transports. In France, there are about 15 million regular smokers; one young adult (18-30 years) in two smokes every day. It seems that high cost of cigarettes is a disincentive, especially for teenagers, to start smoking. Anti-smoking and public health associations "The most important finding, and the one of greatest significance to the company, is their calculation of the price elasticity of cigarettes among teenagers... a 10% increase in the price of cigarettes would lead to a decline of 12% in the number of teenagers who would otherwise begin to smoke."</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">Summary of Image Page Four "Given the evidence that individuals are considerably less likely to initiate smoking after age 25, it is quite possible that the cohort of young smokers who never begin to smoke as a result of the tax increase would never become regular smokers. BACKGROUND NOTE: This useful internal Philip Morris memo, "Teenage Smoking and the Federal Excise Tax on Cigarettes," reveals how effective the anti-smoking commercials of the late 1960's and early 1970's were at decreasing the upward trend in teenage smoking during that period. It also outlines exactly how much adult and teenage smoking rates can be expected to decrease for every incremental rise in the price of cigarettes. There couldn't be a more useful document to demonstrate that raising taxes on cigarettes decreases adolescent smoking rates. Many of us have hypothesized that price elasticities are different for different demographic or socio-economic groups, e.g., that price increases would have less effect on the higher income groups and on the older and therefore more habituated smokers, than on other smokers...The authors of this paper...have used the results of the 1966-70 Health Examination Survey of the National Center for Health statistics, and have constructed an elegant longitudinal and cross-sectional model of teenage smoking behavior. This has made it possible for them to calculate the price elasticity for teenagers and compare it with the generally accepted price elasticity of cigarettes for the total smoking population. The authors conclude that the anti-smoking commericals represented a shock to the underlying upward trend in teenage smoking in the mid-1960's and early 1970's, particularly in the first year in which they were aired, but that the trend reasserted itself the following year, although teenage smoking remained at a lower level than would have been the case in the absence of the anti-smoking commercials....</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">The most important finding, and the one of greatest significance to the company, is their calculation of the price elasticity of cigarettes among teenagers. They calculate that the smoking participation elasticity is -1.2, which means that a ten percent increase in the price of cigarettes would lead to a decline of 12 percent in the number of teenagers who would otherwise begin to smoke. Their calculation of the quantity smoked elasticity for teenagers is -1.4, which means that a ten percent increase in price would lead to a 14 percent decline in cigarette consumption by teenagers. ...Among teenagers the prevalence of cigarette smoking is highly correclated with income (from either allowances or working) while there is no similar correlation between smoking prevalence and income among adults. ...In any event, and for whatever reason, it is clear that price has an pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers, and that the goals of reducing teenage smoking and balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the Federal Excise Tax on cigarettes. ...It is worth noting that government actions designed to reduce smoking in the late 1960's and early 1970's served to moderate an underlying upward trend in teenage smoking, while any government action taken now will accellerate its present downward trend.....

Summary of Image Page Three "Among teenagers the prevalence of cigarette smoking is highly correlated with income." "In my study, I found that the cummulative smoking incidence among boys in 1976 was about the same as in 1979 up to the age of 16, but past the age of 16 (the age at which many of them would have access to a car), the 1979 incidence was substantially below that of 1976." "When it comes to a choice between smoking cigarettes or cruising around in his car, the average teenage male would probably choose the latter." Quotes: Most researchers, myself included, have calculated that the best estimate of the price elasticity of cigarettes is abou -0.4%, i.e., that a ten percent increase in the retail price of cigarettes will cause a decline of about four percent in cigarette sales.</paragraph><paragraph parID="10">This is in contrast to the aforementioned -0.4 elasticity for the total smoking population. For instance, non-smokers' questions, such as how they could be helpful to their smoking friends or parents, were often overlooked. It's OK to tell us to tell others not to smoke but I wish they (the ads) would give us a new line because they (their entourage) get tired of the same old tune, and so do I. (Female, 14, Non-smoker) One such message answered an implicit question smokers may have had about their chances for quitting negatively by implying they were hooked. The following reaction was in response to a television message where a girl resists pressure to smoke from a male peer. Is she going out with him or what, if he's so stupid? How come all this smoke doesn't seem to bother her anyway?</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">(Female, 14, Non-smoker) A message that acknowledged any obstacle young smokers faced in breaking their habit and, ideally, suggested how to overcome them had the potential to be highly conducive to sense-making. This kit is pretty good because they talk about how hard it is to quit and everything you go through... like I would bet a hundred bucks it was written by an ex-smoker . That's the hard thing really, even if the smoke is disgusting. You don't want to be rude or anything because they might say 'Who does she think she is anyway?' (Female, 14, Non-smoker). For example, even self-confident teenagers said they had some doubts about resisting invitations to smoke when they were vulnerable but messages rarely spoke to this specific obstacle.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">Let's say I'm really stressed out with exams and everything, I'm not so sure I could say no. This friend of mine was depressed when she broke up with her boyfriend and said 'Heck, I'm going to smoke anyway.' (Female, 16, Non-smoker) Finally, sense-making about one's health even appeared to be hindered when messages negated the very real obstacles adolescents face when attempting to quit, such as overcoming physical addiction and resisting the temptation to enjoy a cigarette when around smokers. One such television message that made quitting appear deceptively easy when, in fact, adolescents were well aware of the difficulties involved led to this cynical comment. No kidding, the girl throws away her cigarette just like that, I mean really! Hell, I'll do it right now.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">Youpee! it's magic, I'm a non-smoker! (Male, 14, Non-smoker) One way in which messages seemed to favor sense-making about their smoking habits was to help adolescents bridge the gaps they were experiencing with regard to their tobacco intake. For example, one clever message made a startling statement that cigarettes contain a few thousand toxic ingredients thus making teenagers aware of a gap in their knowledge. In contrast, many messages simply overlooked many of the gaps expressed by adolescents relative to smoking, such as the social contradictions surrounding tobacco or the interaction between physical activity or health nutrition on the one hand and smoking on the other. I think my body can afford to smoke because I don't eat a lot of junk food like most of my friends, mostly healthy stuff.</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">On the other hand, a message could potentially interfere with sense-making on this issue when it belittled or negated gaps relative to smoking that adolescents had or mistakenly attributed gaps to them. For instance, one message falsely implied that smokers entertained a gap about the ease of quitting; instead, adolescents interviewed showed a realistic awareness of the difficulty of the task and consequently felt misunderstood. They talk as if we didn't know anything about smoking or never knew anyone who had tried to stop . (Male, 16, Smoker) Messages were more conducive to sense-making about teenagers' smoking habits when they helped them identify resources in their own milieu (suggesting, for instance, how they could turn to their friends, siblings, parents, teachers or doctors) or reinforced their belief that they were their own major resource when it comes to abstaining from smoking. Another way for a message to be helpful in this regard was to point the way to useful resources (such as print material or a hot-line). This poster is good because it gives you a toll-free number to call to get the kit so that way, you don't feel stranded .</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">(Female, 16, Smoker) In contrast, messages that quite simply overlooked resources and provided no clue as to where to turn to for help offered very little leverage for action. This poster doesn't help me at all because what can I do with it? (Male, 13, Smoker) One message actually denied the usual resources for quitting (willpower and peer support) by suggesting the boy in the ad lacked the necessary personal strength and that his girlfriend would not help him in this regard. Another message exploiting visual effects inadvertently condoned a magical solution for quitting, thus implying that the most important resource lies outside the individual; obviously, this was problematic for sense-making since it positioned the teenager in a passive role. When I see this ad, it makes me mad and I feel I've had enough with this smoking thing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">(Male, 15, Smoker) For instance, one television advertisement showed teenagers socializing more with non-smokers and turning to sports to alleviate the anxiety of withdrawal. (Male, 17, Non-smoker) Sometimes, solutions offered were too vague to be of interest for many adolescents. For instance, one message intending to reinforce refusal skills for non-smokers was not very explicit for adolescents who have less self-confidence; in the script, the girl offered only passive resistance to smoking and was saved the effort of talking to her peers and possibly having to deal with negative reactions to her refusal. Surprisingly, many messages simply exhorted behavior change without providing any clue as to how to attain that goal. It's easy to say stop when you don't smoke, but where on earth do you start?</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">(Female, 14, Smoker) More unfortunately, a message sometimes interfered with sense-making that would lead an adolescent to consider relinquishing tobacco when it inadvertently implied there were no solutions for smokers or offered only misguided solutions. (Male, 17, Smoker) For instance, adolescents thought some of the messages examined were useful to remind smokers to respect non-smokers and to project a positive image of responsible adolescents to adults and children. I don't really need that kind of reinforcement but I still think it's a good thing for the younger kids in grade school to see that on TV to make them think ahead of time. (Female, 17, Non-smoker) Unfortunately, some messages appeared so disconnected with adolescents' lived context as to be practically useless for adolescents' sense-making about cigarettes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">I don't know what to say about this ad. It leaves me cold . . . (Male, 15, Smoker) One such message led a female smoker to transform a non-smoking slogan to fit her own situation. I like smoking. It's my decision. (Female, 15, Smoker). In the exploratory studies reported in this paper, Sense-Making Methodology was used as a way to understand what happens when an adolescent encounters an anti-smoking message.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">These revealed that adolescents found anti-smoking messages to be variously supportive, neutral or hindering with respect to their sense-making about cigarette smoking. For example, this happened when the adolescents perceived the messages to relate to their personal experience as well as to their current life situation and had no reason to be defensive about themselves or their peers. This was the case when teenagers found the messages relevant to the problems they encountered, when they either answered questions they had or sparked a novel question, and when they addressed specific obstacles or gaps they faced when trying to quit or attempting to remain a non-smoker. Finally, adolescents also found the anti-smoking messages meaningful when connections were established with resources or solutions that might be useful for young smokers and non-smokers. Anti-Smoking Messages EXPLORATIONS IN ADOLESCENTS' SENSE-MAKING OF ANTI-SMOKING MESSAGES Teenage smokers and non-smokers were interviewed about their experiences with cigarettes and their perceptions of different anti-smoking campaigns that included radio and television public service announcements as well as posters and other print material.</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">The fact that 90% of adult smokers begin smoking before the age of 17 ( Elliott, 1993 ) makes it an important health issue for this age group, especially in view of the fact that, outwardly at least, a clear solution to the problem exists. But even though information about the health hazards of smoking is generally well disseminated, if not totally integrated, by teenagers ( Hirsch, Hill, Frossard, Tassin &amp;amp; Pechabrier, 1988 ; King &amp;amp; Coles, 1992 ), health workers are often dismayed that young smokers do not seem to act upon that information. Sense-Making suggests that a successful communication will be anchored in young smokers' lived context and relate to what they are struggling with and to what they are attempting to achieve. To understand where young smokers are coming from, we first need to know about their experiences with tobacco preceding the encounter with the message and about their current situation (i.e., Are they smoking on a regular basis? If so, to what degree? Are they thinking about quitting? Have they ever tried to stop?</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">What personal needs are served by cigarettes? etc.). Their experiences with the media and with prior health messages as well as the context in which they encounter the message are also of importance. For example, staring at a poster in a doctor's waiting room may be a far different experience from catching a glimpse of it on a passing bus. Teenagers are thus increasingly capable of envisioning long-term consequences, and they can also consider multiple factors in decision-making. Typically, teenagers become absorbed in a compelling group life centered on shared preoccupations like musical trends, fashion, ways of looking and talking, and social interactions. Friends, therefore, become credible sources of information as well as behavior models for all areas of life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">Nonetheless, even though adolescents are outwardly critical of parents and teachers, these significant adults still have a measure of influence in reinforcing values and behaviors conducive to good health. Factors related to the experience of tobacco smoking during adolescence are quite complex because they are in relation with both the micro- and macrosocial entourage on the one hand and psychological variables pertaining to each individual on the other. With regard to the first set of factors, it is generally acknowledged that the influence of peers is the most important factor that determines whether a teenager will begin smoking; subsequently, smoking remains largely a social activity for this age group. Quitting smoking is a complex and dynamic process that begins with the decision to smoke and ends with a long period of abstinence. The difficulty of the task lies with the fact that adolescent smokers develop a pharmacological addiction as well as an emotional dependence on tobacco. Those who do attempt to quit usually encounter relapses and withdrawal symptoms, as adults do. Motivations for wanting to quit are either intrinsic (the will to free one's self from a bad habit, current and future health problems) or extrinsic (the cost of cigarettes, environmental constraints).</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">Girls are especially concerned about their appearance and often fear a weight gain if they were to stop smoking. In general, females prefer gradual methods while males appear more confident that they can quit in a radical manner. An important obstacle to breaking the tobacco habit is that people around them continue smoking; therefore, the help and support of family and friends is an important asset for those who wish to stop. In fact, one of the enticing factors for quitting is apparently the presence of opinion leaders in youth groups. Most adolescent smokers believe they will eventually quit for health reasons and because of the desire to be free from a constraining habit although they seldom have a precise idea about the best time to stop. Teenagers also wonder about the most appropriate quitting method for them, what they will go through and whether they will succeed. Solutions for stopping that they are aware of include surrounding oneself with non-smokers, avoiding smoking areas and choosing an appropriate time like summer vacation; other concrete aids include turning to alternate sources of distraction and relaxation (movies, sports, music,...).</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">If smoking cigarettes entails a physiological dependence, is closely linked to one's self-image, is socially sanctioned and tightly intertwined in the fabric of one's daily life, then it is no wonder that appeals to reason or fright tactics to entice adolescents to stop are not very likely to be successful. The detailed results reported below describe how the adolescents perceived the messages to relate to their personal experience as well as to their current life situations and needs with respect to smoking. The messages were also examined in terms of whether they were relevant to the problems adolescents encountered with regard to smoking, whether they answered questions they might have, whether they addressed specific obstacles and gaps that they faced when trying to quit or attempting to remain a non-smoker. Findings: How Adolescents Make Sense of Anti-smoking Messages In organizing and presenting the findings, I have extracted major themes regarding the adolescents' assessments of and intersections with campaign ads and with smoking. To this end, within each category, I selected at least one example of how adolescents drew support from some messages in making sense of their smoking behavior, at least one example where their sense-making was neither aided nor blocked through a message and, finally, at least one example where sense-making about their tobacco consumption seemed hindered by interacting with the message. The examples collected here come partly from adolescents' responses to direct queries about their sense-making, for example when they answered the question "In what ways does this message help your thinking about smoking or not?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">The linear presentation may give the false impression that adolescents reacted piecemeal to the messages. It is of course an unavoidable reconstruction of their reactions in an attempt to get at a deeper understanding of what the messages meant for them and to find out whether sense-making about the messages connects with sense-making about their own smoking. Supportive with Regard to Experience. As a general rule, the interviews showed that a health message which was anchored in a subject's experience was more likely to support sense-making about smoking. One such message was a radio ad humorously depicting smokers standing outside during winter in order to smoke during breaks. I laughed because that is really the way it is. I could see myself hanging out with my friends during recess to grab a smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">Like you're freezing your . . . you know, because we do it anyway. On the other hand, many adolescent experiences with smoking were overlooked in some messages when it would have been appropriate to acknowledge them. In cases where a message went directly against adolescent experience in a way they found offensive, it seemed to actually hinder sense-making about their smoking behavior. For instance, the portrayal of a disheveled boyfriend who smokes as naive and disrespectful in one television message made adolescents, both smokers and non-smokers, react to the unfair negative representation. Supportive with Regard to Situation. When the situation the individuals were currently experiencing was depicted in a message, it also increased the probability of engaging sense-making about cigarette intake. A common way of supporting this was for messages to address a specific group of youngsters in terms of their situation relative to smoking, such as asking, "Are you thinking about quitting?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">I saw this poster in the bus and I said to myself, well that's me they're talking to because quitting has been on my mind all summer. However, adolescents' lived situations relative to tobacco consumption were frequently overlooked in messages about smoking. On the other hand, when teenagers felt their situation was not depicted accurately, sense-making about their tobacco usage seemed to be actually hindered. In one television PSA (public service announcement), a confident female non-smoker asserted her right to remain so; however, the perceived arrogance of the young girl was not, in their view, a widespread attitude and adolescents were reluctant to identify with her. Supportive with Regard to Needs. Messages that acknowledged the needs met by cigarettes such as relaxation and socialization seemed more likely to support a sense-making process that could eventually be conducive to quitting. A flyer listed reasons why smokers find it difficult to quit, among which the loss of pleasure was mentioned.</paragraph><paragraph parID="28">It's rare that you see any admission that smoking is enjoyable. They usually hit on us instead as though we are out of our minds for smoking. In contrast, when the needs satisfied by smoking were simply overlooked, it tended to make the person feel that tobacco consumption was simply not well understood by those who condemn it. For example, one television message making use of special effects inadvertently condoned a magic solution for quitting, thereby disregarding adolescents' need for recognition of their insights. Some subjects said they actually lighted a cigarette out of spite when they saw this particular message. Likewise, when a message suggested that smokers were arrogant (when in fact they were seen as helpful by their non-smoking peers) or naive (when in fact they were aware of the problems associated with smoking), teenagers did not feel respected and tended to react defensively. In one campaign, radio messages were each dedicated in a humorous fashion to a specific problem associated with smoking (cost, odor, yellow teeth, coughing, shortness of breath, etc.).</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">In such a case, each person had the opportunity to recognize one or more of their own problems. All I can say is it's true! My girlfriend is always complaining about my bad breath. I wonder sometimes how she can stand it! On the other hand, when the immediate problems faced by smokers were simply overlooked, the message was not drawing attention to what could be a starting point for thinking about one's tobacco consumption. Yet adolescents confided that it takes more sophisticated social skills to be self-assertive in this kind of situation as compared to dealing with people you already know. Sure, the girl in the (anti-smoking) ad is so pretty, the guys will talk to her anyway but I remember when you're 14, some girls are so shy they'll do anything if a boy gives them some attention.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">Sense-making with regard to one's smoking habits could in fact be hindered when a message actually created another problem in adolescents' minds. In one instance, young female smokers felt offended by a catch-phrase that suggested that girls who smoke are less natural and less likeable. Another slogan, "To get rid of smoke is a choice for life," also inadvertently created a problem for non-smokers who had not made a fully conscious, long-term commitment to abstinence and felt pressured by such an admonition. Yeah, I don't smoke now but I don't know that I can say I will never ever smoke. They also aptly remarked that such a categorical statement could hinder smokers as well, since it did not allow room for mistakes and negated the fact that many smokers do not succeed in breaking the habit on their first trial. Sense-making was likely to be supported when messages were responsive to adolescents' concerns about smoking. For example, some print materials provided detailed answers to questions about efficient methods for quitting.</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">This is really a good flyer because it tells you what to do when the going gets rough. A message could also be conducive to sense-making when it attempted to spark a fruitful question in a smoker's mind, whether directly or through his or her entourage. My mom had seen this poster in the subway that said 'Do you know what you should know or what you want to know?' (about smoking) and she used to kid me when I lit a cigarette. Given the expense of producing television public service announcements (PSAs) and their notoriously weak impact in terms of behavior change, it is reasonable to doubt their usefulness. But interviews with a diversity of individuals reveal that such messages stand out in the programming flux, nourish conversations and are remembered for a long time. To the extent that PSAs are seen as complementary to other means of health promotion, I believe they fulfill a vital function within a campaign.</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">However, in numerous instances messages could be termed neutral with regard to teenagers' sense-making about their cigarette habit. This happened when the lived context of smoking was ignored, when obstacles encountered by smokers attempting to quit were not acknowledged nor gaps attended to, in short when adolescents did not perceive any suggestion as to how to move forward in their sense-making about their tobacco intake. Finally, there were circumstances where teenagers' sense-making about tobacco seemed to be actually hindered by anti-smoking messages. One example is when young smokers were unfairly portrayed as dependent and unresponsive to others' needs. Another is messages that appeared oblivious to the social dynamics surrounding cigarettes were more likely to antagonize both groups than to achieve any constructive goal. In other cases, adolescents invested more energy in understanding a message that was ambiguous than in thinking about their own health. In short, Sense-Making Methodology allowed us to become aware of different uses teenagers had for anti-smoking messages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">But in what ways is Sense-Making Methodology different from other approaches to health campaigns? For instance, we can assert from a logical standpoint that tobacco is detrimental to one's health, but in order to understand why such a statement is likely to simply slip by a large number of young smokers, we need to understand the meaning of tobacco smoking for adolescents. Thus, most people would agree that teenagers often smoke to fit in with their peers and that pressing obligations to define their self-identity usually make them oblivious to long-range considerations about their health. For example, some of the young smokers interviewed, even though they had no intention of quitting in the foreseeable future, still had questions about when would be a good time to do so, eventually. For instance, it may simply confirm the adolescent's perception that the community at large cares about his health at this point in time, an attitude that may come into play later when he is struggling with a problem related to smoking. Therefore, they reacted negatively to gratuitous effects that did not spark a question in their minds or make them discover some new facet of smoking (in addition to being spectacular to watch). The importance of careful artistic crafting of PSAs (public service announcements) was also highlighted by the fact that some messages, instead of contributing to adolescents' meaning making about tobacco smoking, created gaps and obstacles in their understanding of the message itself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">In short, the Sense-Making interviews underscored the idea that a message about smoking should be synchronized with adolescents' sense-making experiences about cigarettes, but it should also be concordant with their conception of what a public service announcement should be. Most teenagers interviewed were receptive to the idea of health messages designed especially for them, but they did expect a frank treatment of the issue. Although the task of delineating the full theoretical and methodological implications of Sense-Making for media health campaigns is still under way, the prospect of how sense-making about PSAs (public service announcements) intersects with sense-making about smoking opens up exciting avenues for media health communication. Summary of Image Page One Memo reviews study from the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) entitled "The Effect of Government Regulation on Teenage Smoking." Review these 5 proactive ways to stop your teenager from smoking before they get started and educate them on the hidden conspiracy that could land them in the intensive care unit of the local cancer treatment center 30 years from now. Lead by Example - It is without question that the task to convince teenagers to stop smoking is much harder if their parents smoke. Leading by example is one of the most affective approaches to helping teens avoid smoking in the future.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">When you think about it a parent who smokes really can tell a teen not to smoke, this is hypocritical at best and if parents don't realize this has an impact on a teenagers decision to start smoking or even stop smoking for that matter, think again. Proactive Volunteer work - Giving a teenager a visual explanation to stop smoking is ideal, especially when you suggest working as a volunteer in the cancer ward of the local hospital. Teenagers are example seekers and instead of telling them the hard facts and statistics, which is like talking to the wall, give teenagers a reason to stop smoking by showing them the reality of a smoker's life and their final destination. Peer Perceptions - Most teens are confused about fitting in, and unlike the pass where smoking was consider cool let teenagers hear from their peers that's its not. We all know that peer pressure is one of the most common reasons teenagers start smoking , by allowing a forum and room for peer dialogue could be the right medicine a teen needs to stop smoking or not start at all. Don't Preach - preaching to the choir is one of the worse ways to get trough to a teenager about smoking. Whether the teen is smoking or has tried it once or twice, reading them the riot act will only force them into the habit instead of deterring them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">While most parents want to get the facts across most often preaching, yelling and other forms of verbal or physical reprimand can have the opposite effect. Talking to your teenager about smoking as if they're an adult not only caters to a teenager ego in terms of them knowing everything, but it also gives them a reason to communicate. And this is what every parents wants. Research - Don't give your teenagers your reasons to stop smoking, help teenagers stop smoking by making them do the research and coming up with reasons for themselves. By setting a teen on the task to discover the pro's and con's of smoking in their eyes is a better way to target a teenager's misconception of the image of smoking. Remember teenagers are example seekers so by allowing a teenager to set his or her own examples of the hazards of smoking might be the edge parents need to convince their teenager that smoking is dangerous. Teenagers have multiple reasons to start smoking but with a little guidance using these proactive methods, parents can convince teenagers to stop smoking without stressing out in the process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">Find out the most common reasons teenagers smoke and evaluate your teenager to see if he is at risk of falling prey to the tobacco industry's new generation of smoker's campaigns before it's too late. This is why a proactive approach to stop your teenager from smoking before he or she starts is more important now than ever before. The Fab Five Action Plan State and community programs are there to help parents learn ways to stop their teenagers from smoking after they've started; but now is the time to target teenagers who haven't started. Get the facts by going online and researching the statistics for yourself. And call your local program they are just living to help you. Teens oblivious to Anti-smoking ads But campaigns may be helping other Canadians to quit</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">Whenever public officials try to justify the more than $50 million a year the Canadian government spends on advertising, the first ads they point to are those aimed at getting teenagers to stop smoking. These programs take up a huge portion of the public sector's ad budget, but the results have been decidedly mixed. Between 1989 and 1995, the number of teenagers aged between 15 and 19 who smoke daily, has actually increased slightly from 22 per cent to 23 per cent. In the United States, the jump has been even more pronounced. Between 1993 and 1997 the number of college students who smoke went up from 22.3 per cent to 28.5 per cent. Few advertising campaigns have generated as poor results as those in the war on teen smoking. But does that mean that all that ad spending has been a waste of money?</paragraph><paragraph parID="39">Maybe not. It's possible that those anti-smoking ads directed at teenagers have had some effect, just not on them - but on older Canadians. So who is convincing teenagers to smoke? Probably other teenagers. Only one third of those who try the habit become long-time smokers, and this happens over the course of several years, not instantly. Characterizing teen smokers as just a bunch of high school dropouts, with low self-esteem and unfavorable family backgrounds, while trying to convince them to drop the habit is also not particularly useful. It's not that the scare tactics of the anti tobacco lobby haven't worked - they have probably worked too well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="40">Getting a better understanding of why teens have been oblivious to the advertising and media machine aligned against their smoking habits, would tell us a lot about marketing, and how it works... or doesn't. Teenagers exposed to less secondhand smoking The declines may be due to more smoke-free laws and fewer people smoking in the United States, plus a change in the public attitude about the appropriateness of smoking near kids. It tastes foul so you put it out right away and wash your mouth out with fresh clean water because you are a non-smoker now." With a collection of this and similar phrases you learn that another cigarette smoked simply proves by its bitter taste that you are a non-smoker after all. And it works because&#65533;well let&#65533;s face it, the taste of a cigarette IS foul in the mouth of an ex-smoker. I discuss with my clients in the frankest terms how we can help them find a new orodigital ritual that can give them a similar experience of soothing comfort.</paragraph><paragraph parID="41">Options include: gum chewing, carrots in a bag brought to work, or my personal favorite, chewing on a pen. While some of these habits border on the bizarre, I point out cheerfully that none of them are as bizarre as poisoning yourself and everyone around you with deadly chemicals! If you&#65533;re ready to quit smoking, think about what you can do with hands and mouth that feels good and isn&#65533;t too weird to do in public. Hypnotic suggestion can be used to heighten the pleasure of this new ritual, helping us find even greater comfort than smoking once provided. More importantly, I recommend you call our office at 800 950 4984 to find a hypnotherapist in your area who is trained in these modalities. You can also order the John Daughters Forever Free smoking cessation tape from our office for only $19.95. Then I use direct hypnotic suggestion to change the teenager&#65533;s perspective on smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">Hypnotherapy is the therapy of choice for helping smokers to be free of this dangerous and destructive habit. This technique, which I developed in 1983, is based on the assumption that all addictive behavior is the result of attempts by the subconscious mind to treat some kind of deep physical or emotional pain. While the conscious mind may be unaware of the nature of this pain, or its source, the subconscious mind is quite aware of the source of the pain, and can easily access this information in a trance state. Using hypnosis we can then develop a specific inner meditation that treats the source of this internal pain. Then hypnotic suggestion is used to train the client to access this healing meditation every time the client craves this addictive behavior. I find that the feelings and needs of the inner teenager are easy to access in hypnosis, and can be easily dealt with as well. I use induction to return to the teenager who is first learning to smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="43">I then ask that teenager "what is smoking going to do for you?" Maybe he&#65533;ll say "I want to be a real man!" We then use rescue mission methods to have the client&#65533;s adult self assure the teen that they are a real man, and a good and worthwhile person, no matter what mom said or what dad does. Here&#65533;s how I enroll the teenager in saying NO to cigarettes. I encourage the teen to understand that they have been duped by the rich tobacco companies and the lies of rich Madison Avenue ad executives. I suggest that every time the teenager craves a cigarette, they will make a fist with one hand and swear to never give another dime to those evil tycoons. " Because I&#65533;m a real man!"</paragraph><paragraph parID="44">This style of suggestion is especially potent for the teenager, whose anti-establishment attitudes are well documented. Another powerful method developed by John Daughters and used on his tape is a journey to the future smoker. The subject in trance journeys forward 10 to 30 years to their future self who is still smoking. The client and therapist both notice the pale skin, stooped posture, ragged breathing, coughing, etc. of this future self. Then we listen for this person&#65533;s message. "Stop smoking now!" Then the subject promises their future self, out loud if possible, that they are quitting now, and they explain why.</paragraph><paragraph parID="45">Then we watch with delight as the future self is transformed. Their cheeks become rosy, their skin clear, their breathing suddenly easier. Then your future self thanks you for your help. In trance, this technique is quite powerful. A similar technique I use from my NLP training is called "Say goodbye to your old friend cigarettes." So we lead the client through a gentle communication out loud with this old friend. We remember and acknowledge the good times.</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">We review all the painful times when cigarettes were there&#65533;and maybe no one else was. Then we explain to our old friend why we can&#65533;t be friends anymore. "Frankly, you are killing me," we say with true sadness. Then I have the client listen to the cigarette&#65533;s response. Most of the time, the cigarette has nothing to say. The client is sometimes surprised or hurt by this silence. But I remind them of that old Bob Dylan lyric: "you never did much talking anyway."</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">The familiar silence of their old friend often provides the client with a stronger incentive to quit. "Yeah, damn it, you never did talk to me!" I complete this ritual by helping the client to connect with a new friend. This new friend could be a spirit guide, an inner mother, a guardian angel, or even a beloved external friend who can be called upon when the client needs some unconditional love. While it may take time for the client to learn to call upon such friendship, such a friend, I point out, is certainly a better friend to you than cigarettes, health producing rather than health destroying. And this new friend will talk to you, and you can learn to listen to their wisdom and guidance. Quitting cigarettes is complicated by the fact that most smokers crave cigarettes when their body needs oxygen.</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">That&#65533;s because most smokers only breathe deeply when they are inhaling a cigarette. Take several very deep breaths while inhaling through the mouth. Release each breath slowly and deliberately, as if you were smoking a cigarette. Now notice how you feel. Most subjects report feelings of energy, calm, and relaxation, and increased mental acuity. Well, cigarettes didn&#65533;t do it, oxygen did. Thus, I encourage all my smoking cessation clients to breathe just like this several times every time they crave a cigarette.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">This extra breathing not only helps control cravings, but helps the lungs open wide and recover more quickly. An important extra here is to require my clients to drink a glass of water every time they complete this breathing. And water helps the blood clean itself of the nicotine and other toxins that are causing these cravings. Also it helps the lungs cleanse themselves. Since most smokers suffer chronic dehydration as a result of their habit, water is a critical medicine for their body&#65533;s recovery. I won&#65533;t work with any smoker unless they agree to these simple behaviors. And I reinforce these activities with hypnotic suggestion to make them even more compelling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">We all know the dangers involved. One of the best things your teen can do for her diabetes, and overall health, is to not start smoking. Or, if she has already started, to stop smoking. The day your teen stops smoking, his body will start repairing the damage done and he will be on his way to leading a healthier life. Ask for their help. There may be a smoking cessation program your teen can take. Here are some points to keep in mind about smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">If you are a non-smoker, don't start! If you smoke, quit now. Get help from your doctor or health care team. There are proven ways to help people quit. If there are other smokers in your house, quit together so you can give each other support. Ask friends and family to help and to be supportive of your teen's efforts. Don't give up the struggle to quite smoking!</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">It may take several tries, but keep at it. anyways, i just feel that blogging actually can stop smoking although i did not smoke. until now i still remember one of my secondary friend asked me to try because you will forgot something for that moment but i still did not try. sometime you must understand the reason behind why people smoke which because most of them i feel is releasing stress. Many young adults, and that's what they are, young ADULTS, are in a rather impressionable stage in their life. If they recieve proper guidance from their parents, they generally turn out to be well-rounded, compassionate people. If they have a lack of guidance, or are constantly shown a lack of respect, they will no nothing else.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">Instead of harping on a generation only looking for guidance, perhaps harp on your own generations...the ones guiding them. According to our survey teenagers don't seem that bothered; only 58% of them cared whether or not they were described as a comical character like 'Vicky Pollard'. I think that teenagers get a lot of disrespect and everyone thinks they are chavs but they are not. Reducing smoking in young people is an important issue and it is probable that role models in films play a part. They both reported that teenagers who were most exposed to films in which characters smoked were 73% more likely to have tried a cigarette. However, when this figure was adjusted for confounders, these teenagers were found to be 32% more likely to have tried a cigarette. The authors say there is increasing evidence that exposure to risky behaviour in the media (for example via TV programmes and films) is associated with risky behaviour such as tobacco and alcohol use in childhood and adolescence.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">The higher the exposure to smoking in films, the higher the risk of teenagers having tried a cigarette. Those in the highest category of exposure to smoking in films were 73% more likely to have ever tried smoking than those in the lowest category of exposure (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.55 to 1.93). After adjusting for all the confounding factors, including alcohol use and peer group smoking, in the sixth model, this relative risk dropped to 1.32. Those in the highest category were 47% more likely to report they currently smoked after adjusting for age, gender, social factors and family influences. In the analysis of current smokers in which other factors including behavioural factors like problems with attention, depression or anxiety were adjusted for, the relative risk dropped further (RR 1.34, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.87) and became non-significant. The researchers' meta-analysis of existing studies found that viewing smoking in films doubled the likelihood of having tried a cigarette (combined RR 2.13 95% CI 1.76 to 2.57) and increased the likelihood of currently smoking by 68% (combined RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.01). The researchers conclude that their study provides evidence that adolescents in the UK and elsewhere who are exposed to smoking in films are more likely to start or try smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">Although the researchers tried to adjust for confounders, it is possible that other factors, both measured and unmeasured, influenced teen smoking habits. However, due to the design of the study and the previously mentioned limitations, the study cannot prove that exposure to smoking on screen makes adolescents more likely to smoke. While reducing the number of teens taking up smoking is an important issue, it is still unclear whether classifying such films as certificate 18 would have this effect. It said a study of 5,000 15-year-olds looked at their exposure to smoking on screen, and whether or not they had tried smoking. This study found that 15-year-olds who were most exposed to seeing smoking in films were more likely to have tried a cigarette than those least exposed, and were also more likely to be current smokers. This is a large, well-conducted study in more than 5,000 teenagers and its findings will contribute to the debate on the factors that encourage adolescents to take up the habit. The study has several limitations, however, and while it provides a valuable snapshot of teen film viewing and smoking habits, it cannot prove that watching smoking on screen contributes to teenagers starting smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">However, it is unclear at this stage whether reclassifying films featuring smoking to certificate 18 will have this effect. Further research is needed. Where did the story come from? The study was carried out by researchers from the University of Bristol and Dartmouth Medical School, USA. It was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Thorax . Funding was provided by the US National Institutes of Health and the American Legacy Foundation. The newspaper reports were fair, although they did not cover the study's limitations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">Both the BBC and The Independent used figures from the study that had not been adjusted for all the factors that might have been an influence on teen smoking habits. What kind of research was this? This was a cross-sectional study designed to assess whether there is any association between depictions of smoking in films and adolescent tobacco use. They say that while film ratings systems address issues such as violence they do not address the issue of smoking. The researchers say that previous research from other countries has shown that smoking attitudes and the behaviour of adolescents is influenced by smoking seen in films, but it is unclear whether this association applies to adolescents in the UK. In this study, the researchers wanted to investigate whether there was an association between watching smoking on screen and smoking behaviour in a large population of 15-year-old adolescents in the UK. What did the research involve?</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">Data for this research were obtained from a large ongoing Bristol-based study that is looking at the health and development of children. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) enrolled 14,500 pregnant women with an expected delivery date from 1991 to 1992. Detailed information has been collected using questionnaires completed by mothers and by their children after they reached the age of seven years. The researchers looked at data on both smoking and film collected from more than 5,166 15-year-olds in the study. A computer-assisted interview was used to ask adolescents whether they had seen 50 randomly selected films, drawn from a list of 366 popular contemporary films comprising the top 70 US box office hits released between 2001 and 2005. The number of smoking occurrences in each film was counted by trained assistants. The number of occurrences in each film was identified as the total exposure and these were classified into four categories ranging from highest to lowest.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">The teenagers were also asked questions about smoking, in particular whether they had ever tried a cigarette and whether they smoked currently. The researchers also took into account possible confounders, information on which had been collected over time. These included breastfeeding, childhood disorders, social class, parental and childhood behaviour, current alcohol use, other social and environmental factors and whether their friends smoked. The researchers created six different models that took into account different combinations of these confounders, and looked at the association between exposure to films containing smoking and smoking habits in each of these models. They did this to see whether adding or removing the influence of things like family smoking, peer pressure and social class affected the strength of the association. They also looked at data from all existing cross-sectional studies on the effects of smoking in films and summarised these in a meta-analysis . They used a systematic search strategy to identify such studies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">What were the basic results? The researchers thought this was the most representative model (RR 1.47 95% CI 1.07 to 2.01). The meta-analysis included six previous studies and three that were published in the current issue of Thorax , including the one from Bristol. How did the researchers interpret the results? One of the strengths of this study is that the researchers carried out several adjusted models to check for the influence of confounding factors. They also present the results of a meta-analysis that puts their study in context and includes the findings of other studies. The study also had some limitations:</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">As a cross-sectional study, the study cannot establish cause and effect, so it cannot say that viewing films where characters smoked caused teenagers to start smoking. It is possible that teenagers in the study tried a cigarette or started to smoke before they had seen films containing scenes of smoking. The researchers relied on teenagers self-reporting both what films they had seen and whether they smoked or had tried smoking, which could affect the reliability of the study's results. As the researchers also point out, they only recorded whether films on the list had been seen, not the number of times the films had been seen. In conclusion, this large study is a valuable contribution to the discussion about teen smoking habits. Further research and debate is needed. It's hard for any teenager to see beyond the here and now and all of your warnings about the dangers of smoking can go right out of the window.</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">Smoking is a real danger however and you can only try and influence their decisions with hard facts and social debate. The last thing you want to do is to challenge them in a negative way or talk down to them. It doesn't take long for smoking to become the norm so try challenging them with some serious questions. Let them come to the right conclusions through careful discussion and through adult conversation where you let them know that you respect their rights but that the negatives against smoking far outweigh any positives through pressures from their friends. Pressure from those friends can be overwhelming though so be prepared that it won't be a instant decision but all you can do is to plant the seeds of doubts in their minds and hope that the reality of the situation germinates and they will wise up to the dangers of smoking and stop. If you can treat your children like adults and provide a two way communication that is reasonable and fair, they are less likely to be swayed by others. Knowing their own mind and caring about their health will be deciding factors.</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">Don't be scared to tell them the truth about smoking addictions and how hazardous it is for their health. There is a mass of information available from doctors' surgeries and from health clinics. There is also an abundance of information on the Internet too, plenty to give them food for thought about their smoking habit. Clarifying that they are not only putting their own health at risk, but with the dangers of passive smoking, their habit is liable to affect others too, with potentially, quite serious side-effects . Many teens also use smoking as a way of challenging parental authority, of being "independent". Long after the smoker reaches adulthood the inner teenager can still be driving us to smoke if these feelings remain unresolved. Do something daily or every few days that is just for you, such as going out to a concert or a movie, or taking the time to enjoy a long hot bath or shower.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">Try saving the money you would have spent for cigarettes in a jar, then buying something on your wish list. Don't become discouraged if you quit and then smoke again. Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off and set a new quit date. Don't be afraid to try over and over - your persistence will eventually pay off. Remember that you CAN succeed at this challenge to better your health and that of others around you. Breathing Techniques to Help You Relax * Take a normal breath in and out through your nose, breathing calmly and evenly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">* As you exhale, think of a relaxing word such as "calm" or "peace." * Count to four, then begin your next breath. * Do as many repetitions as it takes for you to feel yourself relaxing. * Everyone knows that tobacco manufacturers target teens! They have to. They need new customers to replace the ones they have killed. * This year about 30,000 kids in Canada will become regular smokers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">Quitting once you are hooked is not easy. Ask any smoker. * Over half of Grade 12 students who smoke are unable to quit and more than 70% still smoke eight years later due to nicotine addiction. * 8 out of 10 teens who try smoking get hooked. 5 years later, 80% are heavy smokers. * Over 20% of high school girls are daily, regular smokers * 80% of teen smokers would like to quit.</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">Within months of their first puff, most teen smokers struggle to stop smoking, but most can&#146;t quit. * 60% of teen smokers try to quit. Most smokers try several times before stopping for good. So if at first you don&#146;t succeed, try again. * Most smokers start before they finish high school. If you can make it to high school graduation without smoking, chances are you never will start smoking. * Nicotine is a powerful, mood-altering drug that is extremely toxic.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">It is as addictive as heroin and cocaine. Tar is a dark, sticky combination of hundreds of chemicals including poisons and cancer causing substances. Chemicals are carried to every part of your body by the blood. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances in the world, the reason most of us smoke is because we are hopelessly addicted to it. Sure, we probably started off because of peer pressure or we wanted something to relieve our stress, but after a while we carry on smoking simply because we are addicted &#150; plain and simple. Beating any addiction is never easy, and the longer you&#146;re addicted for the harder it is to beat. Smoking is probably the hardest addiction you will ever have to overcome.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">But, it need not be that hard; in fact with the right knowledge and the right product it can actually be quite easy. Understanding Why Teens Smoke &#147;Smoking is dangerous to your health. &#148; A very famous anti-smoking ad that is often neglected by smoking teenagers. Such problems may arise, especially when dealing with out of control teenagers. And this is where a parent&#146;s dilemma starts. As a parent of a smoking teenager, you might have no idea why your teen starts to smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">And the first question that might cross your mind is how can I ask my teen to quit? Before you can do this, it&#146;s important to understand a few things first. Why Do Teenagers Start Smoking? Peer pressure is one of the most common reasons why teenagers smoke. If one of their friends has started, they think they have to smoke also. They do this to maintain acceptance and the sense of belonging to a group. Another reason for smoking teenagers is image projection.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">An &#147;image&#148; is attached to cigarettes like being cool, manly or grown up. Adolescence is the time when teens struggle for identity. If teens want to have one of these images, then smoking maybe the answer they&#146;re looking for. Problems at home may put a lot of pressure on your kids. And they use smoking as a form of relief for the stress. For many out of control teenagers, this is a result of rebellion. Knowing that this will annoy their parents and because it is forbidden, it becomes more alluring to them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">Teens like to act as if they&#146;re dangerous or mature. By smoking, they can act on those feeling. They might just want to try it the first time but as we all know, once you puff, it is hard to stop. This is because nicotine is present, which is highly addictive but ignored by many teens and adults alike. Consequences of a Nicotine Habit Smoking is a hard habit to break. Along with it, you can acquire harmful effects to your health.</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">If you smoke, you can also end up with bad skin. Substances like nicotine block blood vessels that prevent nutrients from reaching the skin, which in turn causes premature aging. Adolescents are very much concerned with their appearance and personal hygiene. Reminding them that cigarettes leave smokers with persistent bad breath might turn them away from smoking. And the stale smell of the smoke often lingers in their hair and clothing, which is extremely unappealing to others that don&#146;t take up this nasty habit. There is also an increased risk of illness. And to top it off, smoking teenagers may experience a greater risk for injury and a slower healing process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">As a parent, you might want to discuss these consequences with your son or daughter. Understanding more about this harmful habit may lead you to a more informative conversation with your teen.

For Parents</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">If you find your teen smoking, take it seriously. Stopping teen smoking in its tracks is the best way to promote a lifetime of good health. Start talking. You could simply tell your teen to stop smoking. But commands, threats and ultimatums aren't likely to work. Instead of getting angry, be curious and supportive. Perhaps your teen is trying to fit in at school, or maybe your teen thinks that smoking will help relieve stress or pressure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">Sometimes teen smoking is an attempt to feel cool or more grown-up. Once you understand why your teen is smoking, you'll be better equipped to address smoking as a potential problem &#151; as well as help your teen eventually stop smoking. Encourage your teen to share his or her concerns. Although the consequences of smoking &#151; such as cancer, heart attack and stroke &#151; are real, they're probably beyond the realm of your teen's concern. Rather than lecturing your teen on the long-term dangers of smoking, you might ask your teen what he or she considers the negative aspects of smoking. Once your teen has had his or her say, offer your own list of negatives. Consider appealing to your teen's vanity:</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">* Smoking gives you bad breath. * Smoking makes your clothes and hair smell. * Smoking turns your teeth and fingernails yellow. * Smoking makes you look pale and unhealthy. * Smoking causes wrinkles. * Smoking leaves you with a hacking cough and phlegm. * Smoking zaps your energy for sports and other favorite activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">Of course, smoking is also expensive. Prompt your teen to calculate the weekly, monthly or yearly cost of smoking. You might compare the cost of smoking with electronic gadgets, clothes or other items your teen considers important. One final note - statistics say that a high percentage of teens actually want to quit smoking! Ask your child if they would quit if they had a government approved medicine to help them quit. If so, then you need our medicine to help them. And don't forget - it is Guaranteed to Help Your Teen Quit or Your Money Back!</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">How to Deal with A Teen Who is Smoking A minor who smokes is not likely to walk right up to their parents with a cigarette firmly between their lips. Just because a parent doesn't see their teen smoking doesn't mean that they don't have a smoking habit. Parents need to talk to their child about smoking and watch for signs that they are smoking. Smoking can be a strong temptation for some teens, especially teens that have friends or family that smoke, and even though cigarettes aren't supposed to be sold to minors, teens are still able to get them. The First Reaction You have just found an empty packet of cigarettes in 15-year old Anna's bathroom cupboard!</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">Shocked, you are ready to confront her and demand explanations. But before you do... Ask your teen what made him or her start smoking. Are you nagging your child over trivial matters instead of getting to the root of the problem. If your answer to most or all of these is 'No', then a possible reason Anna smokes is that she wants to appear 'cool' to her friends. This requires a different approach. If the answer to any of these is 'yes,' then you have at least found your direction.</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">You will have to uncover her fears and problems layer by layer, until she is comfortable with herself and does not need cigarettes as a crutch. This is easier said than done. Anna may not want to talk or she may not tell you the truth each time you do talk. Teen smoking is a huge problem with teens, especially girls, who are lighting up younger and younger. The mix of tobacco and parental and social disapproval is too much to resist. Telling them to quit and showing them the dangers probably won't do much good, because it will only make it seem more exciting. Preaching to them would probably just make them continue to hide it from you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">The trick is to address the problem in a way that will help them stop smoking immediately, especially if they are in their early teens. Clearly, there is no single path to overcome the problem and find a solution. How you handle the situation will depend on your relationship with your teen, what strategy you employ, and what works best for your teen. However, a large number of young people are now aware of the dangers of smoking and try to quit for several reasons including their health. Asking anyone to quit smoking won't work until they want to quit. As parents, we have our work cut out for us finding out what will motivate our teens to quit smoking. Make a list of the bad things that happen when you smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">Then make a list of what you like about smoking. You may use the above to help get you started. Compare these two lists, and decide for yourself why quitting smoking would benefit you and those around you. Prepare Yourself Construct an action plan, which should include: * Set a date for quitting, avoiding time periods which are likely to be very stressful. Mark it on a calendar, and tell family and friends.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">* Notice situations and emotions which cause you to reach for a cigarette. These are your smoking triggers. Some triggers might be: * Stressful situations: Often the first response to stress is to reach for a cigarette in order to calm down. Instead, it is often effective to learn relaxation through deep breathing exercises. Once you learn these techniques, taking a few minutes to put them into practice tends to help reduce stress. You can see a therapist to help you learn these techniques. A basic exercise is included at the end of this post.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">* Negative emotions: Feeling upset, embarrassed, or angry can be one of the biggest triggers for smoking. Relaxation exercises help here as well. * Daily routine: Most people have a routine to their day, including when they smoke. Some people smoke with a morning cup of coffee, some in the car, some during breaks at work. During these times, your body is primed to crave nicotine. Be attuned to this, and have a plan to help with this craving. Some people find it useful to replace the hand-to-mouth feeling with something similar: eat carrots or chew sugarless gum, for example.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">Any of these sorts of tricks may help fool your body into feeling the comfort that smoking offers. Gather Support Tell your family and friends your quit date, and get in the frame of mind to accept their support and help. For example, have them help you distract yourself from smoking. Work colleagues can often be helpful as well. Why not find someone who can be a "quit buddy" and the two of you can quit together? Implement Your Action Plan</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">On the day you quit: * Throw away all of your cigarettes, lighters and ashtrays. * Stay busy, preferably with activities that keep your hands busy. * Exercise, eat well and drink lots of fluids. * Use your support system. * Carry things to put in your mouth instead of cigarettes, such as hard candy, gum or raw cut vegetables. * Practice your deep breathing exercises.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">Evaluate and Fine-Tune Your Plan Review your efforts and evaluate what in your action plan worked and what did not. Keep doing what has been successful, but don't focus on interventions that have not been helpful. Instead, think about different ways to achieve your goal. Don't Be Hard on Yourself Everyone has a hard time at first, and everyone slips up from time to time. Don't dwell on this - instead, focus on your successes, Even if you have made only one change, or if you managed to have only one cigarette fewer than usual during the course of the day, you are well on the way to improving your health!</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Feel good about your efforts, and notice how empowered you feel. Reward Yourself More research is needed before policy makers can make truly informed decisions about whether criminalizing youth possession of tobacco will serve as an effective deterrent to teenage tobacco use. The second question that any community considering the adoption of youth anti-possession measures aimed at teenage tobacco use needs to seek an answer to is, "What is the experience in communities that have criminalized youth possession of drinking?" This surge in teen smoking is due to a number of factors, including the targeting of minors in tobacco industry advertising, coupled with an alarming decline of concern among teenagers about the dangers of cigarette use. Youth anti-possession measures are the subject of heated debate in the tobacco control community. Advocates believe that anti-tobacco possession initiatives are an effective and essential deterrent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">[ The literature supporting these measures emphasizes how these measures are congruent with alcohol control policies, are an effective deterrent, create parental involvement because of greater accountability, and reinforce positive values in adolescent society.] Those who advocate criminalization of youth possession believe that youth anti-possession measures will signal disapproval of youth smoking and of providing cigarettes to minors. Supporters of youth anti-possession measures believe they may also encourage closer monitoring by parents of youth smoking. Advocates of criminalization of youth possession of tobacco feel that teens may choose not to smoke or to smoke less often because of perceptions of decreased social acceptability or increased risks from parental or legal authorities Advocates of youth anti-possession measures also believe that once children find out that it is illegal to be caught with tobacco they will be less likely to want to be caught with it, especially if they know that punishment is something like temporary suspension of their driver's license or some other valued privilege. Advocates feel that this will be especially true of largely law-abiding kids. Municipalities may be creating a deviant subculture of individuals who gain self-esteem by contempt for the law. Another fear is that criminalizing tobacco possession may romanticize the practice of smoking among young people.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">Still others fear that enforcement will selectively be based upon gender, race, or class variables. Those who oppose the adoption of youth anti-possession measures also believe that such measures will 1) deflect the attention of law enforcement personnel from lawbreaking merchants who sell tobacco to minors and misdirect it at kids; 2) reduce merchant compliance with the law; 3) create a climate of disrespect for the law (as such measures are not likely to be stringently enforced); 4) increase the allure of tobacco by making it even more forbidden and dangerous than it now seems and creating an even more intransigent counterculture of rule-breaking teens. Critics of youth anti-possession measures are also quick to point out that the tobacco industry -- which has a long history of supporting ineffective youth access restrictions that often contain hidden agendas -- supports such measures. Due to the fact that many people who are concerned about youth smoking feel they cannot wait until research proves or disproves the efficacy of criminalizing youth possession as a deterrent to teen smoking, however, it is my intent to provide them with the information needed to make as informed a decision about this issue as possible by summarizing and discussing 1) what is known about criminalization of youth possession of tobacco and its effect on teen tobacco use; 2) the parameters of the youth possession problem, and the logic of the arguments for and against the adoption of youth anti-possession measures; 3) alternatives and adjuncts to criminalization of youth possession; and 4) how to fit youth anti-possession measures into a comprehensive approach to tobacco control so that local policy makers can make as informed a decision about this issue as possible. Lack of Enforcement: The Experience to Date with Youth Anti-possession Laws The first question that any community contemplating the criminalization of youth possession of tobacco needs to seek an answer to is, "What is the experience in communities that have criminalized youth possession of tobacco?" The available research to date indicates that tobacco youth possession laws are almost never enforced.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">[Joseph Cismoski, Blinded by the light: The folly of tobacco possession laws against minors, WISCONSIN MEDICAL JORNAL (November 1994) at 593.] This is especially true when one looks at rates of enforcement as compared to the prevalence of violations. This may be true, in part, because police departments seem unwilling to devote large amounts of time or personnel to enforcement of youth anti-possession laws. And, as Joseph Cismoski points out, Even if the police were of a mind to enforce a local ordinance, given the portability and ease of the use of cigarettes (even more so for smokeless tobacco), it is extremely unlikely that the rate of apprehension would be such to have a meaningful deterrent effect on the prevalence of tobacco use. This is because one of the best analogies available to tobacco control advocates may be the criminalization of youth drinking. What has the experience been with these laws?</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">While raising the drinking age from 18 to 21 has been an enormous public health success, [ Mark Wolfson, et al., Law Officers' Views on Enforcement of the Minimum Drinking Age: a Four-State Study, PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS, Vol. 110, No. 4 (July-August 1996)at 428] criminalization of youth possession of alcohol has, in general, produced mixed results. These laws are not enforced very stringently. An estimated 2 of every 1,000 occasions of illegal drinking by youth under 21 result in an arrest. Most researchers point to 1) a lack of enforcement personnel; 2) the unwillingness of most police departments to commit substantial resources to this issue; 3) lack of juvenile detention facilities; 4) lack of enforcement follow-through in the courts ("slaps on the wrist"); and 5) selective enforcement (i.e., these laws are enforced against juveniles perceived as "bad apples" by law enforcement personnel, but not against kids who are perceived as otherwise "good" youths). Selective enforcement of youth anti-possession statutes is a particular danger, because, ...[S]elective enforcement, when perceived to be used in a pejorative way against those youths for whom tobacco use has become a defining characteristic (e.g., the chronically truant, low academic achievers, those of low socioeconomic status, etc.) may only further entrench their behavior and encourage disregard for law enforcement personnel.</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">Many researchers feel that criminalization of youth drinking has resulted in a mistaken focus on underage lawbreakers as opposed to those who violate the law to provide alcohol to them. For every 1,000 arrests of a minor for youth possession of alcohol, only 130 retail outlets have any action taken against them and only 88 adults are arrested for furnishing alcohol to youth. [ Wolfson, supra note 9 at 429.] The Parameters of the Teen Tobacco Use Problem The third task facing any community considering the criminalization of youth possession of tobacco is an evaluation of the arguments for and against the adoption of such a measure. Any such evaluation must be rooted in a thorough understanding of the parameters of the teen tobacco use problem. The fact that teen use of tobacco is a serious problem is clear.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">Eighty-two percent of adult smokers begin smoking before they have reached 18, the age at which they are legally allowed to be sold cigarettes. [ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Trends in Smoking Initiation Among Adolescents and Young Adults, MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT, (July 21, 1995).] In fact, a majority of high school seniors who smoke at least a half pack each day say that they have already tried unsuccessfully to quit smoking -- some of them repeatedly. It has been estimated that 13 percent of 12- to 18- year-olds (3.1 million youngsters) smoke cigarettes, [U.S Dep&#146;t of Health &amp; Human Servs , Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People: Surgeon General&#146;s Report, 9(1994).] and that one million use snuff or chewing tobacco. [ Don Colburn, Rise in Teen Smoking Has Experts Vexed, WASHINGTON POST, September 10, 1996 at ___.] Tobacco advertising is one of the likeliest causes of teen tobacco use.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">As Dr. Gregory Connolly, the Director of the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program, recently told CBS&#146;s "48 Hours," the fact that over 80 percent of smokers begin smoking before the age of 18 means that any tobacco company that does not recruit underage smokers will go out of business. Tobacco industry promotional activities aimed at minors lure generation after generation of underage Americans into beginning what will become for most of them a lifelong and deadly addiction, and cigarette advertising plays a preeminent role in encouraging children to smoke. Young people are twice as likely to be influenced to begin smoking by advertising and promotion of cigarettes than they are by peer pressure. A recent study, authored by John Pierce at the University of California, was based on interviews with 3,536 California adolescents, and found that more than half of those surveyed were familiar with at least some cigarette brands and ads, and one in five admitted being eager to own a promotional item offered by the cigarette companies; over 70 percent of those surveyed said that ads portrayed smoking as enjoyable, relaxing and a means for reducing stress; 60 percent of those questioned were familiar with the Joe Camel campaign, which was nominated by those surveyed as their favorite cigarette promotional campaign.</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">Every major tobacco advertising campaign has corresponded to a major increase in smoking among 14- to 17-year-olds. For example, the number of teens who took up smoking surged upward in the 1980s following intensive promotional campaigns by tobacco companies, including the debut of R.J. Reynolds&#146; Joe Camel campaign. [ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, supra note 37 at 524.] In 1980, when tobacco companies spent $771 million on promotional giveaways, 5.4 percent of 14- to 17-year-olds started smoking. That dropped to 4.7 percent by 1984, but then rebounded to 5.5 percent in 1989, the year the industry spent $3.2 billion on caps, T-shirts, trips, coupons and other promotional items. The highest rate, 6.3 percent, came in 1988, the year R.J. Reynolds introduced the Joe Camel cartoon character. Meanwhile, the percentage of adult smokers dropped, from 33.2 in 1980 to 25.5 in 1990.</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">Teenagers are much more vulnerable than adults to cigarette advertising. In a 1973 memorandum entitled "Research Planning Memorandum on Some Thoughts About New Brands of Cigarettes for the Youth Market", Claude E. Teague, Jr., then R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's assistant director of research and development, lays out a clear strategy for attracting underage smokers and "learning smokers." Teens project themselves into the picture enjoying those things -- taking risks, enjoying adult activities, being comfortable in social situations and smoking. The cigarette companies know their targets well and have identified the major psychological vulnerabilities of children: poor self-image, awkwardness, low self-confidence, the desire to fit in and be admired by peers, and the need to feel like an individual by rebelling against adult authority. Those who advocate the criminalization of youth possession of tobacco argue that youth anti-possession measures will act as an effective deterrent. They argue that teens may choose not to smoke or to smoke less often because of perceptions of decreased social acceptability or increased risks from parental or legal authorities (i.e., once children find out it is illegal to be caught with tobacco, they will be less likely to be caught with it -- this will be especially true of largely law-abiding kids). Advocates contend that this will be especially true if teens know that punishment is something like temporary suspension of their driver's license or some other valued privilege.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">Given that most teen smoking is rooted in adolescent rebellion, will perceptions of decreased social acceptability or increased risks from parental or legal authorities deter most young people from smoking or actually encourage more rebellious teens to smoke? Are punishments like temporary suspension of a driver's license or other valued privilege the solution to linking smoking with short-term as well as long-term negative consequences? Advocates also argue that criminalizing youth possession will create greater adult involvement in the issue by signaling strong disapproval of teen smoking; and encouraging closer monitoring by parents of youth smokers. Given the fact that a very negative view of teen smoking has permeated the news of the last few years, is the criminalization of youth possession likely to add much to signaling disapproval of teen smoking? Will the criminalization of youth possession really make parents take the dangers of youth smoking any more seriously than they already do?</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">On August 28, 1996, the federal Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") issued its "Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents." As made clear in the article (above/below), the FDA's new rule makes the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products to anyone younger than 18 years of age a federal violation and requires manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to comply with certain conditions regarding the sale, distribution and promotion of tobacco products. The Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program has placed a heavy emphasis on urging communities to restrict youth access to tobacco and to stringently enforce proscriptions on the sale of tobacco to minors while denormalizing tobacco use by adults. This is done in cities and towns all across Massachusetts via 1) restrictions on vending machines, self-service displays and the sale of single cigarettes or "loosies"; 2) heavy fines for merchants who sell tobacco to youth; and 3) compliance checks to catch merchants who sell tobacco to underage youth. A community environment that reinforces non-tobacco use as the social norm will provide the greatest hedge against children and youths using tobacco and concomitantly encourage responsibility. First and foremost, statutes against those doing trade in tobacco selling to minors should be systematically enforced through the use of random, unannounced, and frequent...compliance checks using under-age youths as buyers. Research has verified their effectiveness.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">[Cismoski, supra note __, at 596.] Given that the fact that the problem of youth smoking is rooted in the targeting of teens in tobacco advertising and the easy access that teens have to tobacco products, the approaches embodied in the FDA's new rule (which attacks the advertising that creates demand) and in the youth access restrictions adopted in many Massachusetts communities (which attack the supply side of the equation: the giving or selling of tobacco to teenagers) seem like sensible alternatives to the criminalization of youth possession of tobacco. At a minimum, such measures are arguably necessary adjuncts to such criminalization. In any event, restrictions on tobacco advertising such as those embodied in the FDA's new rule, restrictions on youth access to tobacco such as bans on vending machines and the sale of single cigarettes, and the stringent enforcement of proscriptions on the sale of tobacco to minors should be supported in the war against teen smoking. Because, unlike the criminalization of youth possession of tobacco, there is empirical data to support their efficacy in the war on teen smoking. [See Joseph DiFranza, et al., Youth Access to Tobacco:The Effects of Age, Gender, Vending Machine Locks, and "It&#146;s the Law" Programs, 86 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH at 221-224 (1996); Forster, et al., Survey of City Ordinances and Local Enforcement Regarding Commercial Availability of Tobacco to Minors in Minnesota, United States, 5 TOBACCO CONTROL at 46-51 (1996); Karen D. Keay, et al., Effect of a Retailer Intervention on Cigarette Sales to Minors in San Diego County, California, 2 TOBACCO CONTROL at 145-157 (1993); U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, State Laws Restricting Minors&#146; Access to Tobacco, MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT (June 1, 1990).] These efforts also need to be linked to denormalization of tobacco use among adults.</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">The message "we don't want kids to smoke" only reinforces tobacco advertising when it is not linked to denormalization of tobacco use among adults, because such advertising portrays smoking as one of the few remaining initiations into the adult world and as part of the illicit pleasure category of products and activities. Indeed, the basic overt message of much of tobacco advertising is "Kids shouldn't smoke, but if you want to look and act like an adult, go ahead and do it." The way to combat this aspect of the appeal of smoking to teenagers is to denormalize the use of tobacco by adults through things like restrictions on adult smoking in public places. Because kids who are around a lot of smoking adults are more likely to smoke. This is especially true if the adults are parents, teachers or other role models. As one seventh grader told the researchers conducting the 1993 Massachusetts Tobacco Survey, "I know I'm not supposed to smoke in school, but teachers get away with it." Adult smoking can be denormalized further by publicizing of the negative health consequences of passive smoke or environmental tobacco smoke need to be better publicized.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">Environmental tobacco smoke is the third leading preventable cause of preventable death, after active smoking and alcohol. More recently, some have argued for the criminalization of youth possession of tobacco as a simple vehicle whereby police or other enforcing agents can simply confiscate any tobacco possessed by minors. Many police departments advocate the passage of local laws criminalizing youth possession and allowing for the confiscation of cigarettes, because they have no legal recourse when they encounter a group of smoking teenagers in the absence of such laws. Those who are skeptical of the efficacy of criminalization of youth possession of tobacco also argue that criminalizing tobacco possession may further romanticize smoking as an "outlaw" practice among teenagers. Community members need to consider the following question: "Given the fact that the tobacco industry spends millions every year to lure teenagers into smoking, do we want to punish young people who have become addicted to tobacco or stigmatize them as 'criminals'?" Any community adopting such a measure needs to do more if it truly wants to combat teen smoking. Stringent enforcement of the proscriptions on the sale of tobacco to minors, and increased penalties for merchants who furnish tobacco to youth.</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">Teenagers who are caught with tobacco products might learn valuable lessons if they are then instructed to do community service in places like the oncology wards or cardiac units of hospitals Suspension of driver's license or other valued privileges for those caught smoking. This is part of the ongoing effort to link smoking to negative short-term as well as long-term consequences. First-time offenders can be placed in community-run tobacco education groups designed to motivate teens to adopt a healthier life style or to join a tobacco cessation group. Such groups are often led by teen ex-smokers. Strong support for cessation efforts among teens and adults who use tobacco. Combining enforcement with public education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">Such public education could be modeled on the notion of adapting CDC's February 25, 1994 "Guidelines for School Health Programs to Prevent Tobacco Use and Addiction" for wider use in communities. Telling kids about the negative short-term consequences of smoking. Teenagers need to be shown that smoking now will cause 1) shortness of breath; 2) permanent wrinkles; 3) diminished stamina (with its negative effect on sports performance); 4) damage to the vocal chords; 5) bad breath; and 6) the beginnings of long-term health consequences that may or may not be reversible. (How many teen smokers know that they may already be suffering from minor forms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that may later bloom into full-blown asthma?) They need to know that smoking costs them a lot of money now and that it could cost them a job in the future. By the time they enter the seventh grade, most children are convinced that smoking endangers their health in the long run. They know that if they continue to smoke when they are older they may very well get sick and die.</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">For now, however, smoking is thought to be okay. They see plenty of adults who model this activity to them and everyone in the movies seems to do it. In the late 1970s, psychologist Richard Evans and his associates developed a program to help children resist pressure from their peers and others and to help convince them that there are some immediate physiological consequences for those who smoke. [R.I. Evans, et al., Deterring the onset of smoking in children: Knowledge of immediate physiological effects and coping with peer pressure, media pressure, and parental modeling, 8 JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY 126-135 (1978).] Experimental subjects were then shown four brief videotapes dealing with the dangers of smoking, the advantages of not smoking, the effects of smoking on other people, a description of peer pressure and how it brings about smoking, parental smoking, pressures from the mass media, and the effects of advertising. Featured in the tapes were young people who were the same general age as the audience. Afterward, the subjects answered questions about the tapes, engaged in small-group discussions about pressures to smoke, and were exposed to classroom posters on these topics.</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">Among students in a control group (which did not see the videotapes, etc.) 18.3 percent began to smoke during the first term of the seventh grade. In the experimental groups, the figure ranged from 8.6 percent to 10.3 percent. In other words, these preventative procedures were able to cut the number of new smokers in half. Informing teenagers in ways that will make an impact upon them that cigarette smoking is the single most preventable cause of premature death in the United States. An estimated 419,000 deaths attributable to smoking (approximately 20 percent of all deaths) occurred in the United States in 1990. Teenagers need to be taught in graphic and creative fashion that The American Cancer Society has estimated that smoking caused 170,000 cancer deaths &#151; nearly one-third of all cancer deaths &#151; in 1995.</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">Teaching teenagers in ways that will stay with them that the nicotine contained in tobacco products is addictive. The ads produced by Houston-Effler fight the tobacco industry with the same tools the industry has been using to hook kids: imagery and association. This counter-advertising campaign impresses upon children that 1) smoking leads not to independence but to a lack of control; 2) smoking has short-term and immediate physiological consequences such as reduced stamina (this is linked to poor sports performance, something many teens care about); 3) smoking can cause even more severe short-term health consequences; 4) the absurdity of the messages contained in tobacco advertising; and 5) the ways in which the tobacco industry uses its advertising and promotional paraphernalia to attempt to manipulate teenagers to smoke. A study of the life experience of adolescents [ Key variables will likely include gender, age, personality, coping style, peer culture and the impact of the family, school, religion and retail establishments that sell tobacco products.] is vital to understanding how these laws affect behavior and whether they deter teen smoking. The quantitative and qualitative research that needs to be done will, thus, complement and place in context the other empirical research currently being funded on this topic. The ideal study would provide state and local policy makers throughout the United States with the in-depth empirical data needed to assess the social impact and effectiveness of measures that criminalize youth possession of tobacco.</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">What needs to be done is a quantitative and qualitative study of how legal sanctions affect smoking attitudes and behavior among early adolescents in six or more diverse Massachusetts cities. Three of the targeted cities should be cities that have adopted youth tobacco possession statutes. The other three cities would have to be chosen carefully so that they have been matched on demographic characteristics but have not enacted anti-possession statutes. Researchers could work with agencies like the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program to gain access to grades six through eight in the public schools of the six communities. The research protocol to measure adolescent attitudes and behavior could then be developed with the assistance of MTCP-sponsored anti-tobacco youth groups. Youth leaders could be trained by researchers to lead focus groups exploring key variables. (Social surveys of adolescents pose very difficult measurement problems and refining the research protocol is difficult.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">Researchers should plan to examine the question of whether regulating the possession of tobacco products among teenagers affects their attitudes and behavior. This study would be of great value to states and municipalities considering passing such measures or devoting further resources to enforcing the measures that exist. [ We will also explore the role of the school, community and family as supporting or subverting the enforcement of these statutes. Do anti-possession statutes deter? Are the anticipated effects of the statutes realized? This research will assist state and local governments in deciding whether to pass new measures or devote additional resources to enforcement.] A Tool of Last Resort?</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">Something more obviously needs to be done about the problem of youth smoking, as teen smoking rates continue to rise all across the country. Whether the "something more" should be the criminalization of youth possession or redoubled efforts to reduce youth access on other fronts remains to be seen. Existing empirical data supports the effectiveness of youth access restrictions like vending machine bans, bans on self-service displays and bans on the sale of single or loose cigarettes. The limited research that has been done to date on the effects of criminalization of youth possession of tobacco on teen smoking rates indicates that youth anti-possession measures are not the panacea that many advocates of them wish they were. Perhaps they should be seen as tools of last resort that should be used only in conjunction with the other preventative and anti-access measures described in the sections above. In any event, the effort to reduce youth smoking rates is something we all need to get involved in, because, to paraphrase Albert Camus, "We may not be able to create a world in which no children [are duped into smoking by tobacco advertising], but we can reduce the number of children who are [so duped]. And if you do not help us to do this, then who will help us to do this?</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">In all likelihood, teens who start smoking now will not be able to quit. What needs to be done, however, is an empirical study of teens and teenage culture, the population targeted for enforcement. For most, quitting smoking is a long, up-hill battle that usually ends in disappointment and failure. A big reason that people fail is that they don't spend time practicing and planning. But what if you could do a lot of planning and practicing strategies of quitting long before you actually quit? What if you had time to get used to the idea of quitting?

Lieberman Research, Inc., "The Teenager Looks at Cigarette Smoking," Table 22, P. 118. Smoking by women and children was particularly assailed. Men, women, and children went right on smoking (as in the realms of the czar, the sultan, and the mikado centuries before), and in 1927 the last of the statewide cigarette prohibition laws was repealed. In Idaho, incredible as it may seem, the minimum cigarette age for men was twenty-one, but girls could smoke at eighteen.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">In Massachusetts snuff and cigars were forbidden to young people under sixteen; the ban against cigarettes continued until eighteen. Almost all of them had seen the powerful anticigarette messages then being aired on television; indeed, the teenagers in the sample reported having seen an average of 8.9 anticigarette television spots during the previous four weeks. The vast majority of these teenagers, moreover, were convinced by what they had seen and heard. As in the case of adults, however, a firm conviction that smoking causes cancer and heart attacks had very little effect on teen-age smoking habits. It may be, of course, that a ban on all cigarette advertising would have little or no immediate effect on the recruiting of youthful new smokers; the other factors may be sufficient to maintain recruiting at present levels even in the absence of advertising. But no other methods of discouraging young people from beginning to smoke offer any likelihood of success so long as cigarette advertising remains licit. Meanwhile, what of the effects of current public health anticigarette campaigns on children and young people?</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">More than two-thirds of these teenagers (70 percent of the nonsmokers and 66 percent of the smokers) recalled anticigarette presentations to which they had been exposed in school. 18 Similarly, 71 percent of the teen-age nonsmokers and 66 percent of the smokers agreed it was "definitely or probably true" that cigarette smoking triples the likelihood of a heart attack. 23   The majority confidently expected to stop in five years or less. The thought that many smokers can't stop seems not to have occurred to these teenagers. They believed not only the campaigns stressing smoking as a cause of cancer and heart attacks, but also the campaigns insisting that it is possible to stop smoking if you "make up your mind" to stop. That in effect was the majority view among the teenagers in the Lieberman sample. They suggest that it requires considerable effort of will and perhaps some suffering.</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">A majority of the teen-age smokers in the Lieberman sample envisioned themselves as confronting that challenge a few years hence, and winning. I just wanted to give you an update as to how I have been doing. Mostly, things have gone very well. Physically, this is the best I have felt in twenty years. I have been going for walks and along the way will jog for a bit which isn't bad considering I turned 59 yesterday. As an asthmatic I have used a puffer for most of my life. Naturally as a smoker I would have to use the puffer to clear my airways enough to smoke my next cigarette.</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">Hard to believe. People are proud of me and quite surprised. In closing I would like to say that it is your efforts which have put me in a position to succeed and I thank you for that. Yesterday was my One Year Anniversary for quitting smoking!!! I want to thank you once again! I did not believe on that day that I would actually succeed; I was secretly sure that I would be one of the ones who would be quoting the "Money Back Guarantee" clause to you. What is most remarkable is that I have actually forgotten about smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">Last year, the thought of being left without cigarettes would fill me with dread, and I knew where all the 24 hour convenience stores where "just in case". I was prepared to try my best at it, but was sure that I even if I were able to, I was going to miss smoking, and that some enjoyment out of life would be gone. Instead, I have absolutely forgotten all about cigarettes! Occasionally, I see an empty pack of cigarettes littered on the road, or I see someone smoking and I think "Oh yeah, I used to smoke..." As cigarettes are $9.00 a pack (I never bought cartons) I have saved about $3,000.00 in this last year. No more filthy ashtrays, my nagging cough has completely cleared up and I feel better and have more energy. Thank you so much for helping me to accomplish this!</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">I just thought I would drop you a line and thank you from the bottom of my heart for facilitating, promoting and ultimately guiding my way back form the dark pit that was my life smoking. I truly do feel like I have been given a new lease on life. So I just wanted to thank you for being the catalyst that helped me see the light once again. It has been 9 days and I really and truly cannot say that I suffered letting go of that nastiness. I feel so much better. My lungs and chest have opened up. It really feels so great that it is motivating me to not want to ever feel that way again.</paragraph><paragraph parID="124">By the way, your session on the 13th was so well done. You really do have a gift for the work that you are doing and it is a noble thing as well, because it helps people to re-gain a very precious gift. So, thanks again Damian. I hope to send as many people as I possibly can to the program. I attended the Easyway seminar one year ago on Sept 16, 2007 and quit smoking. When I consider the health benefits, it is a miracle enough, but then I considered the financial benefit of saving over $3,000 and the 7,300 cigarettes I have not smoked in the last year, it amazes me. Thank you Nicole and Damian for your wonderful program and support.</paragraph><paragraph parID="125">Councillor Sharon Jackson, Duncan, BC. Please use this message to support public recognition of Allen Carr's work. Until two months ago, I had smoked more than a pack a day for more than forty years, apart from one period of about a year. Thanks to the EasyWay seminar you led, I am now completely cured of my addiction. Public recognition of Allen's work in this field would not only reward him for his contribution to society, but would also bring his work to the attention of all those who really want to quit but think that they can't. It is hard to believe that tomorrow will mark eight weeks without smoking. Since I started smoking as a teenager, I estimate I must have smoked at least 250,000 cigarettes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="126">That my body appears to have forgiven me is the biggest miracle of all. Nicotine medications can help by dulling your cravings for a cigarette and are proven to increase your chances of quitting smoking. (Healingtalks) For those who still don't know - let me emphatically state that cigarette smoking is a true addiction ! To grasp this well-documented fact, one really doesn't have to study all the supporting scientific evidence. One simply needs to consider that no other drug is self-administered with the persistence, regularity and frequency of a cigarette. At an average rate of ten puffs per cigarette, a one to three pack-a-day smoker inhales 70,000 to 200,000 individual doses of mainstream smoke during a single year. Ever since its large scale industrial production early in this century, the popularity of the modern cigarette has been spreading like wildfire.</paragraph><paragraph parID="127">Here is the first, and perhaps the most significant answer to the title question: Addiction is in a cigarette . Probing into what makes a cigarette so irresistible, we find that much of the recent research corroborates earlier claims: It is for the nicotine in tobacco that the smoker smokes, the chewer chews, and the dipper dips. Teenagers are future consumers often highly impressionable and in some societies with significant disposable income; for any company where brand and consumption of their products are important, attracting younger members of society increases the chances of longer term lock-in. With the tobacco industry, ironically perhaps, as their products kill their customers (or as customers try to quit), they need to find newer consumers. Younger people will take a longer time to die or quit, thus increasingly the likelihood of continued sales. Most people start smoking before the age of 18; almost a quarter of these individuals begin using tobacco before the age of 10 For their 2008 World No Tobacco Day event , the WHO noted that "Most people start smoking before the age of 18, and almost a quarter of these individuals begin using tobacco before the age of 10."</paragraph><paragraph parID="128">Would changing the pack size make a difference and catch on? Smokers generally don't purchase cartons but more expensive packs. So they might be willing to do the same for smaller packs. The limited access can help cut down or quit smoking. Part of the reason for larger 20-cigarette packs is to impede youths from smoking by keeping cigarette pack prices high. But according to the CDV, only about 14% of youths who smoke buy their cigarettes directly from a store. 84% get them from  family and friends.</paragraph><paragraph parID="129">Impediments to smoking Among the enacted impediments to smoking are: Increased federal, state and even city excise taxes FDA ban of flavored cigarettes that appeal to youths Ban of all outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools Making it illegal to sell to those under 18 Let's add another</paragraph><paragraph parID="130">Teen smoking is again on the rise so why not help them and the majority of smokers trying to quit or cut back by mandating smaller packs.

Breaking News: Teen Smoking Skyrockets (Healingtalks) A study reported that American teenagers are becoming casual smokers, instead of heavy/regularly smokers. In general young adults already had the highest smoking rates of any age group in the U.S., and thue new strategies to decrease young adult smoking are needed. Researchers found that occasional smoking among teens rose from 1991 to 2009, while heavy smoking fell significantly. We're seeing a broad national phenomenon," said Dr. Terry Pechachek, a study co-author from the Centers for Disease Control.</paragraph><paragraph parID="133">"With fewer cigarettes, the price effect, smoke-free policies and a change in the broad public awareness of risk, the heaviest patterns of use are becoming very rare," Pechachek said. But he warned against assuming that moderate smoking is safer in the long-run. "It is important to note that light and intermittent smoking still has significant health risks," Pechachek explained. "We think there may be an emerging pattern. We may be creating a new type of smoker that may be more durable, that are adapting to smoke-free environments and to changing social norms." Pechacek said that the high percentage of intermittent teenage smokers is unacceptable. "It's still a very risky behavior.</paragraph><paragraph parID="134">We want to get across to people that although this is a positive trend, it's very unacceptable to have so many children exposing themselves to something so addictive. The greatest danger is minimizing the risk." Here is more information on the study results Major Rise in Teen Casual Smoking Heavy smoking was defined by enjoying more than 11 cigarettes per day . Moderate smoking was defined as enjoying between six to 10 cigarettes per day. Light smoking was defined by having to five cigarettes per day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="135">Between 1991 and 2009, heavy smoking among teenagers has decreased by 10 percent, from 18 to 8 percent. During this time, casual teen smoking has increased from 67 percent to 79 percent . No significant changes in smoking trends for African American teenagers was observed, but for Hispanic teenagers, the heavy smoking rate increased from 3.1 percent to 6.4 percent . Risks of Teen Smoking Smoking has different risks for people who smoke at all. By smoking, people have an increased risk for heart disease, heart attack, lung cancer, and other types of cancer. An estimated 90% of all lung cancer in males are caused by smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="136">An estimated 80% of lung cancer in females is caused by smoking. Teenagers today are even more vulnerable because of the introduction of ever more adulterated GMO, and sugar-addictive fast foods that help create a teen obesity and diabetics epidemic . Resulting Early Deaths From Smoking According to the CDC, smoking cigarettes has contributed to an estimated 443,000 deaths annually. Nearly one of every five deaths in the U.S. are related to smoking. Tobacco causes more deaths per year than Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV), illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle injuries, suicides, and murders all combined. This study was reported in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine.</paragraph><paragraph parID="137">How To Fight Teen Smoking Nathan Batalion, Global Health Activist, Healingtalks Editor Overview of Teen Smoking (Healingtalks) Each day in the United States, 3,900 teens try smoking for the first time, estimates the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Don't allow your teen to become just another statistic. By talking with your teen in a frank and mature way, while setting a good example, you can help fight teen smoking and convince your teen to never start in the first place.</paragraph><paragraph parID="138">Luckily, resources and parental support can help your teen to make the right choices when it comes to smoking. Discussions with Children and Teens on Smoking Start the discussion about smoking at a young age. The American Cancer Society recommends that the discussion begin with your child is only 5 or 6 years old. Talking about the health and social effects of smoking should be an ongoing dialogue in your home so that when your child grows into a teen, your opinion on cigarettes has been made clear. The ACS notes that many children take their first puff at age 11 ; it's never too early to start talking about smoking. Point out the health, social and economical dangers of smoking to your teen.</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">Ask why he would want to participate in a habit that makes his clothes and hair smell, his body sick and his wallet empty. Ask your teen to make a list of the various pros and cons of smoking and to weigh the costs versus the gains to make the decision on smoking on his own. Role Play Teen Pressure to Smoke Try role-playing exercises with your teen to ensure that she knows what to do in a situation where a cigarette is offered to her, suggests the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Pretend to be a peer and offer your child a cigarette. Remember to be as convincing as another teen might be, trying to entice your teen by saying smoking is fun, lots of people do it and it's not like he'll become addicted. Coach your teen through the things he can say to politely say "no" and leave the situation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">Offer a good example for your teen. MayoClinic.com notes that smoking is more prevalent among teens whose parents also smoke. To set a good example, make sure that you show respect for your body and health by exercising and eating well, not only by abstaining from smoking. This shows your teen that you respect your body and want to maintain good health, ideals and values that can be passed on to your teen. Direct Your Teen to Online Resources Show your teen online resources that she can read on her own time. These resources, like the ones found at Kids Health, a division of the Nemours Foundation, and the American Academy of Family Physician's Web site, give the health risks of smoking in plain terms that your teen can understand.</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">It may help her to see that you're not the only adult who disapproves of smoking.

Of course, we all know the above.... don't we? If only we were all so rational about smoking. Addictions by-pass the rational mind.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">Thus smokers need to be reminded, especially in the midst of a half century or more of sophisticated advertising featuring healthy-looking role models with huge smiles on their faces rather than pictures of the devil, sculls and bones, of death, disease, or the true outcome. According to K. H. Ginzel, M.D., Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Arkansas, this deceptive imagery "captivates and seduces a growing youngster. The youngster, indispensable for being recruited into the future army of smokers, does not start to smoke cigarettes for the nicotine, but for the false promises they hold. What's not in a cigarette, an honest message or promise of benefits. What's not in a cigarette - the means to a better life vs early suffering and death. What is really by K. H. Ginzel, M.D.</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">Most Outstanding Ingredient in a Cigarette (Healingtalks) For those who still don't know - let me emphatically state that cigarette smoking is a true addiction! Hence, nicotine is in a cigarette . Nicotine and Much More in What's in a Cigarette In contrast to other drugs, nicotine delivery from tobacco carries an ominous burden of chemical poisons and cancer-producing substances that boggle the mind. Many toxic agents are in a cigarette. However, additional toxicants are manufactured during the smoking process by the chemical reactions occurring in the glowing tip of the cigarette.</paragraph><paragraph parID="146">The number is staggering: more than 4,000 hazardous compounds are present in the smoke that smokers draw into their lungs and which escapes into the environment between puffs. ( Healingtalks) Federal health officials released on Tuesday their final selection of nine graphic warning labels to cover the top half of cigarette packages beginning next year, over the opposition of tobacco manufacturers. In the first major change to warning labels in more than a quarter-century, the graphic images will include photos of horribly damaged teeth and lungs and a man exhaling smoke through a tracheotomy opening in his neck. The Department of Health and Human Services selected nine color images among 36 proposed to accompany larger text warnings. The images are to cover the upper half of the front and back of cigarette packages produced after September 2012, as well as 20 percent of the space in cigarette advertisements. Dr. Lawrence R. Deyton, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Tobacco Products, said the government estimates, based on other countries' experience, that the new warning labels will prompt an additional 213,000 Americans to quit smoking in 2013, the first full year with the graphic labels. But they also include some of the less vivid, including a cartoon depiction of a baby rather than a photo in the draft set that showed a mother blowing smoke at a baby.</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">The images, which are to appear on cigarette packs on a rotating basis, also include one of a man proudly wearing a T-shirt that says: "I QUIT." All of the packs will also display a toll-free telephone number for smoking cessation services. The F.D.A. has already proposed nine text warnings to be paired with the images, including: "Warning: Cigarettes cause cancer " and "Warning: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health." Saiful Islam, 34, a convenience store clerk, said higher prices would cut sales a lot more than the images on cigarette packs. Smoking is allowed in pubs, bars, discos and beer tents, but pressure is mounting on the government to bring Germany in line with other EU Member States and ban smoking in public places altogether. Smoking is illegal under the age of 16 in public. Most adults who smoke started smoking as teenagers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="148">Figure 21: Proportion of students who were never smokers, experimental smokers or current smokers among students with no, one or two parents who smoke, 12-15-year-olds and 16-17-year-olds, Victoria, 2005 - no parent, one parent or two parents smoking Analysis of data on smoking among Year 10 students in New Zealand in 2007 compared with 2001 has shown that the decline in smoking prevalence has been greatest for students with no parents smoking and least for students with both parents smoking (Table 7b of the NZ report). Additional evidence since 2004 Adolescents who smoke become dependent quite rapidly on tobacco-delivered nicotine. School-based programs After decades of effort pursuing tobacco education in schools, fewer than half of the published studies of rigorously designed trials show evidence of short-term effects, and almost none have demonstrated long-term effects. A peer-led intervention (ASSIST), focusing on training opinion-leading teenagers in persuasion techniques for use when talking to their peers about smoking outside the classroom,[387] has recently demonstrated promising results.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">[388, 389] This approach is worth monitoring. Family programs Parents who smoke can socialise their children against smoking,[390] but family-based programs aiming to discourage smoking have been only modestly successful[391] and would be difficult to deliver population-wide. Such programs have rarely involved siblings. What parents can do There is much that parents can do to discourage their children from taking up smoking. Lead by example</paragraph><paragraph parID="150">Young teenagers with one or more parents who smoke are more than three times more likely to experiment with smoking, and older teenagers are almost three times more likely to smoke regularly than the teenagers of parents who do not smoke. 12-15-year-olds 16-17-year-olds [393] Quitting by parents has a very strong effect on subsequent smoking by children, and is probably the single most important thing that a smoker-parent can do to prevent their children from taking up smoking. An Australian longitudinal study shows that children of non-smokers are also more likely to remain non-smokers in the long term. [395] Smoking by children is also highly related to sibling smoking, and older teenagers often state that they hope their younger siblings do not experiment with smoking: siblings may be an untapped resource for tobacco control. [396, 397] Go smoke-free</paragraph><paragraph parID="151">US studies[398, 399] find that even after controlling for demographic factors and parents' smoking status, children who lived in homes where smoking was banned were more than 20% less likely to take up smoking than children who lived in homes where smoking was allowed. However, there is little evidence that educational interventions can encourage the adoption of smoke-free homes. Be a strong family Children who spend more time with their families and deal effectively with conflict are less likely to take up smoking: eating dinner together most nights really does seem to be a very good idea! [401] Lack of parental supervision is also strongly associated with smoking experimentation. [392] Top of Page Progress in Australia</paragraph><paragraph parID="152">The websites of state Quit campaigns suggest that they continue to provide information and resources to schools. Little information is available about the reach of programs at the school or individual level. Bans on smoking in shopping centres and the widespread adoption of smoke-free homes must make it increasingly difficult for children to experiment with smoking undetected by parents. Evaluation of the 2001 Parents campaign (featuring a young girl recounting a recent event to her dying father: 'You should have been there, Dad'), and focus group and tracking research on the WA Cancer Council's testimonial advertisement depicting a real smoker talking about her fears about what will happen to her children when she dies,[402] suggests that narrative adverts can have a strong impact with low SES parents. Action proposed Continue to monitor and keep abreast of findings of studies assessing the impacts of interventions aimed at teenagers outside the classroom, particularly those involving siblings and those focused on disadvantaged groups. Given the likely impact on both parents and children, Quit campaigns should see parents as an important target group for advertising. The Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer to include in future reports of ASSAD the long-term trends for teenagers (in each major category of smoking status), whether parents smoke and whether their homes are smoke-free.</paragraph><paragraph parID="153">Apparently this is a signficant contribution to teen binge drinking...... Really, Oz has no laws already in place for contributing to the delinquency of a minor?! I can't see there being any other viable solution other than governments taking control of the market and managing prices and supply with the aim of reducing consumption rather than maximising profit. But the fact remains that increasing price and decreasing affordability can modify behaviour. Just look at smoking - draconian taxation and laws against smoking in restuarants, shopping cnetres and government buildings etc have combined to dramatically reduce smoking. Alcohol, gambing, smoking,......... Arnold Worldwide Canada developed the pot-smoking pilots concept, one of four concepts tested in focus groups involving young Canadians in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Quebec.</paragraph><paragraph parID="154">Reactions of participants in all groups to the pot-smoking pilots were immediate and thoughtful: "Pilots are professionals; they wouldn't do that sort of thing" and "The pilot is the one who has to deal with potential problems and disturbances; he's the one with your life in his hands." The safety of passengers was an expressed concern, with comments such as, "Because they're smoking up, there can be very serious consequences because there are a lot of passengers" and "If you were a passenger you wouldn't want to know that your pilots were rolling a joint." So how do you become involved in this campaign? We've provided the pot-smoking pilots poster to raise interest, the 10 Questions to start the discussion, the youth-oriented responses to those questions, and the research to back it all up. We hope you will download and use these Pot and Driving resources: Discussion guide (for adults who want to engage teenagers in a discussion about pot and driving) (PDF: 198k) The Pot and Driving Campaign</paragraph><paragraph parID="155">You'll never hear pilots announce to their passengers that they're smoking a joint before takeoff so they can relax and enjoy the flight. But if these pilots were drivers and they were in a car, would the situation be different? Letting go will be easier for parent and child if you're able to talk freely about the changes your children are experiencing. In the process of struggling to find out who they are, teens "try on" various identities. Your best bet is to sit back and remember how it was when you were a teenager and to talk with other parents of teenagers. It's a given that parents worry about their teens experimenting with drinking, driving, smoking, sex, drugs, and staying out late. Be available when your teenager wants to talk, no matter how tired or busy you are.</paragraph><paragraph parID="156">Let teenagers know where you stand by setting limits and sticking to them, such as what time to be home and what the consequences will be if limits aren't met. Once a child has reached adolescence, you don't worry about another person providing care; your concern now is whether your teen is taking good care of himself or herself. Adolescents often benefit from organized, supervised activities they can enjoy with their friends. It is necessary to keep giving teenagers a serious anti-smoking education, provided in ways that reflect their cultures and experiences. Smoking is not personally or socially desirable. Debunk the myths that tobacco is necessary for stress reduction, an attractive appearance, and a good social life. Point out that the places where smoking is allowed are decreasing--evidence that fewer people smoke and that many people, including teenagers, don't want to be near cigarette smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">Speak directly to girls, possibly in separate programs. Give them information showing the falseness of their beliefs that smoking will help them lose weight, make friends, and look sophisticated. Smoking takes away a smoker's free choice.Adolescents want to be in control of all areas of their lives. So show them how tobacco addiction takes away free will, particularly the ability to stop smoking, despite a smoker's desire to quit. Smoking is not an adult habit or an effective act of rebellion. Present the fact that only 27 percent of adults smoke to show that smoking doesn't go hand-in-hand with maturity. Tell teenagers who want to resist controls on their lives that their target shouldn't be non-smoking adults.</paragraph><paragraph parID="158">Instead, they should rebel against anyone who wants to hook them on a habit that is very hard to break. Smoking destroys good health. Show them the probable physical effects of smoking in full detail. Warnings about future health consequences may not be as effective as other messages, though, because youth usually do not believe they will ever have serious physical problems. Teenagers also have difficulty envisioning themselves (i.e., still smoking) later in life. Show the dangers of second-hand smoke. Point out that fewer than 20 percent of teenagers smoke regularly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="159">In fact, in California, only 5 percent do. Therefore, youth who begin to smoke because their peers do are really caving to perceived pressures from a minority. It is okay to refuse to smoke. Therefore, it is very important to help youth develop "refusal skills" to give them the courage to remain true to their own desires and beliefs. Anti-Smoking Policies, Programs, and Practices It is best to provide an anti-tobacco education in a variety of ways and places. It should begin early in children's lives because on average youth smoke their first cigarette at age 13. It should continue all through school, because some youth, especially African Americans, do not begin smoking until they graduate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="160">Anti-smoking programs that are created by, or at least involve, youth are most effective. Rites of passage programs, for males and females separately, which provide information on staying healthy physically and emotionally. A rap video using multicultural models in situations that teach refusal skills. A "take back the community" project, where billboards with cigarette ads are whitewashed. Short plays, written in street language and performed where youth gather, which provide information about smoking and other dangers to adolescents. Other successful anti-smoking projects include peer counseling, assemblies featuring speakers representing the same cultures as the young audience, booths at malls and fairs, and a contest for the best anti-smoking rock or rap song. Designate schools as smoke-free places, and prevent the nearby sale and use of cigarettes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="161">Put an anti-tobacco message into many courses, not just health education: economics, life management skills, home economics, biology, etc. Create, publicize, and uniformly enforce clear rules regarding student substance use. Provide intensive staff training in anti-smoking education. Develop an anti-tobacco advertising campaign for print, radio, and television media, and request free placement and air time. Use models and situations that appeal to youth and reflect their cultures. Incorporate anti-tobacco education into youth programs of all types. Incorporate anti-smoking strategies to use with their children into all types of programs for parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="162">Provide anti-smoking education along with other services in adolescent clinics. Provide addiction recovery services to adolescent and adult smokers. Prevent the sale of cigarettes to youth and display of tobacco promotions. Create a climate unfavorable to substance use and send the message that use is not widespread. Develop leaders and promote community bonding, cultural pride, and bicultural competence by youth. Establish homes as smoke-free places. Refrain from smoking, if possible, or at least provide a strong anti-smoking education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="163">Remind older children that they are role models for younger family members, and that many youth begin to smoke because their older siblings do. So, giving up cigarettes will not only improve their own lives, but the lives of their younger relatives. Provide children with good overall supervision and support. Take a parenting skills course to learn how to provide an anti-smoking and refusal skills education at home. Anti-tobacco education that provides youth with information and support, and that continues over all the years of their growth, will help keep them from acquiring the smoking habit. At the same time, young people should be helped to deal with other problems that cause stress and depression: family neglect or abuse, school failure, unemployment, pregnancy and parenthood, and community crime and violence. The important thing to do is to talk to your teenagers, keep lines of communication open, and try to point out the dangers in pre-teens and teens beginning to smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="164">Why do people start smoking and continue to smoke? Most of them start when they are teenagers. They want to look "cool," fit in with their peers, and are more likely to smoke if their friends and family smoke. Most adult smokers started smoking before they were 15 years old. Smoking creates an "image" that many teenagers associate with smoking. It's being tough, cool, sexy, attractive or as a form of rebellion. Why do they continue to smoke?</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">They continue to smoke because it is habit forming. The chemicals, especially the nicotine reduces the withdrawal symptoms between cigarettes. Smoking is an addiction. They begin smoking because their friends smoke, and continue to smoke especially in certain situations. Teenagers smoke if they are talking on the phone, after eating, with caffeine products or alcohol, and just sitting around with their friends. They don't necessarily notice a "craving" just smoke automatically in certain situations. Stress also can cause a teenager to smoke, or if they are angry, depressed, or bored.</paragraph><paragraph parID="166">It gives them an emotional boost if their feelings are unbalanced. Third, it is physically addicting because of the nicotine in the cigarette smoke. This nicotine addiction starts immediately after a teenager starts smoking regularly. It damages small blood vessels, restricts the flow of blood to hands and feet, and could even cause gangrene and amputation. If you smoke you are ten times more likely to die early from stroke or heart disease. Smokers suffer from severe bronchitis and emphysema more often than non-smokers. Smoking affects your breathing and you don't have to have bronchitis or emphysema.</paragraph><paragraph parID="167">There is a decrease in lung capacity and a smoker will have a harder time with physical activities such as swimming, jogging, playing sports, or working out in an aerobics class. Smoking is the main cause of throat, lung, and mouth cancer. It really does harm your body! What else does smoking do? It makes you smell bad. Smoke clings to your hair, clothing, and especially your breath. Think about kissing an ashtray, that's what it is like to kiss a smoker.</paragraph><paragraph parID="168">If you are a smoker, chances are, you've gotten used to the smell of the tobacco and don't even notice it anymore. Remember other people can still smell it. Smoking turns your fingers and teeth yellow, makes your skin age faster, and affects your complexion. As well as the health concerns, think of how much money you would save by kicking the habit. The good news in all of this is your body can repair itself quickly if you stop smoking. Nicotine will leave your body in less than two hours; the deadly carbon monoxide leaves the body's blood stream after twelve hours. All other by-products of nicotine are gone within two days!</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">It only takes two months for the circulation in your arms and legs and even better news, your lungs start to repair themselves in about three months. After a person has stopped smoking, they will notice their sense of smell and taste returns, you enjoy your food more, and your skin will lose the grayish cast that all smokers' skin has. Best of all, your body will be free of stale tobacco smell, and your chances of getting heart disease or skin cancer starts to fall. Maybe your teenager thinks they are immune to all of these symptoms by smoking "light or filtered" cigarettes. There is no evidence of any kind that shows a reduction in health risks by smoking light cigarettes. They are just as addictive as a regular cigarette, they will still cause heart and lung disease and they still contain as much nicotine and tar. You aren't saving your body from health risks by smoking these cigarettes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.

The problem is that many teenagers start smoking due to peer pressure or when there already is a smoker in their family. Instead, smokers would have to leave their friends inside and go outside to smoke. This would be particularly unpleasant when it is cold or wet. One third of smokers in Scotland said the ban was helping them to cut down.</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">If smoking was a less social activity, fewer people would start smoking. In many countries, governments pay all or some of the cost of treating smoking-related diseases. This means that governments should have a right to discourage smoking. Consumption drops thanks to the ban. In workplaces where smoking is banned, 18% of workers smoke daily and their averge consumption drops to 15.4 cigarettes per day. By contrast, when there are no bans, 40% of workers smoke daily and their average consumption is about 20.1 cigarette per day. "Smokers smoke less in workplaces that ban smoking", October 2004</paragraph><paragraph parID="172">The government shouldn't play the role of Big Brother with a smoking ban. Many groups argue that a government should not try and shape the social choices of its citizens toward desired social ends; people should be as free as possible to do what they want, as long as their actions don't violate the liberties of others. In this framework, governments should not intervene in the personal choice of a citizen to smoke - through a public places smoking ban - for any expressed purpose of affecting a "positive" change in that citizen's personal choices. Smoking quantities: Would a smoking ban reduce smoking overall? A smoking ban will cause people to smoke less overall. Smokers need to maintain a certain level of nicotine in their blood to remain content. A ban on smoking in public would force them to smoke less while at work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">Over time, this would lower the level of nicotine they need to feel content. This would reduce how often they need to smoke. They would therefore smoke less at home, as well as less at work. Research suggests that in work places where smoking is banned, the proportion of daily smokers drops by 22% and their average consumption declines by 5 cigarettes per day. Banning smoking in public would cause people to smoke more at home. Heavy smokers are unlikely to give up since they are addicted to nicotine. Banning smoking in public will, therefore, only encourage people to smoke more at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">This will harm other people in their houses, particularly children. This is important, since children are not old enough to choose freely to smoke passively. Also, people smoking at home may drink more alcohol than they would if they went to a bar. Pubs and clubs should adapt, for example by trying to earn more money from selling food. After a ban was introduced in New South Wales (Australia), only 9% of restaurants reported a drop in trade. A smoking ban would drive many bars and restaurants out of business. Smokers will not go to non-smoking places.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">The claim that more non-smokers will visit bars and restaurants has been proved to be untrue. These businesses would also earn less money from selling tobacco. In many places, pubs and Working Men's Clubs are important social places for communities. - Would a smoking ban be enforceable? Fines and penalties can ensure businesses comply with a ban. There have been few problems with bans where they have been introduced. Heavy fines put off companies from allowing people to smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="176">A survey for the Scottish Executive found that 99.4% of premises were observing the ban three months after it was introduced. It is impossible to police a ban in many public places. Small workplaces will often ignore the ban and are unlikely to be caught. Staff who do not smoke are unlikely to report smokers, in case their colleagues work out who told the authorities. How the smokers can be efficient at work when they are addicted to nicotine, when a couple of cigarettes per day helps them to fulfill their tasks quickly and well? Public opinion: Is banning smoking in public places popular? Majority of Europeans support ban on smoking in public place.</paragraph><paragraph parID="177">While 70% of Europeans are non-smokers, 86% are in favour of a ban on smoking at work, 84% in other public places, 61% in bars and pubs and 77% in restaurants. Many public places such as schools have set aside a portion of the grounds in which smokers may smoke. Teenage Smoking Encouraging Children Not To Start Smoking Children who talk to their fathers about the issues that are important to them are less likely to take-up smoking during early adolescence, a 2010 University study found. Dr James White from the Cardiff Univerrsity   School of Medicine undertook a three-year-study, involving some 3,500 11 to 15 year-olds, as part of the British Youth Panel Survey - a self report survey of children in the British Household Panel survey. Results indicated that one of the strongest protective factors for reducing the risk of experimenting with smoking in early adolescence was how often fathers talked with their children, both boys and girls, about 'things that mattered'.</paragraph><paragraph parID="178">The frequency of family arguments and family meals did not have a significant effect. Dr White, who presents his findings to the British Psychological Society's Annual Conference in April 2010, said: "This study suggests that a greater awareness of parents' and especially fathers' potential impact upon their teenagers' choices about whether to smoke is needed. Fathers should be encouraged and supported to improve the quality and frequency of communication with their children during adolescence. "The impact of teenager parenting is relatively un-researched and further research is very much needed." Only children who had never smoked at the time the study began took part. As well as their smoking, the children were also asked about the frequency of parental communication, arguments with family members and the frequency of family meals. After three years, the responses of children who had remained non smokers were compared to those who said they had experimented with smoking at some point.</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">Recognised risk factors for smoking, such as age, participant sex, household income, parental monitoring and parental smoking, were all taken into account during analysis of the study's findings. It is illegal to buy tobacco and cigarettes under the age of 16. Teenagers and alcohol According to recent surveys, half of all 14-year-olds have been drunk at least once.

In that case, put some rules in place and be prepared to back up your rules and limits with some effective consequences. Finally, no matter what other people think, you know your own child best so you are in the best position to decide at what age your teenager should be allowed to make decisions for themselves. Remember that many different factors will influence your decision. Have confidence in your own knowledge and experience and your child's. The challenge for parents is to know when to give their children control and how much control they should give at any point. There are many different views about what age teenagers should be before they are allowed to do adult activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">Opinions will vary between people, families, communities and cultures. The idea is that teenagers are given greater independence as they demonstrate the ability to be responsible. This happens gradually as the young person's thinking and emotions develop, and they gain practise and experience in decision making. Researchers at Melbourne's RMIT University asked many parents and their teenagers for their views about when teenagers should be able to decide things for themselves. 15 &#189; For instance, students are legally obliged to stay at school until they are 16, and smoking and drinking are restricted to people 18 years or older. Given the results of this survey, don't be surprised if you and your teenager disagree about when they should be allowed to decide things for themselves.</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">And, be aware that these disputes are likely to be about common, everyday issues. The best way to help teens quit smoking is to make them want to quit. Discuss specific house rules on smoking - Parents can have a better chance of convincing their teens to stop smoking if they also don't smoke at home. It would also help to impose punishment for smoking or for when your teen smells like cigarette smoke. It's also important to punish teens when you catch them with cigarettes or lighters in their possession. Whether they admit that it's theirs or not, saying that mere possession is unacceptable and they need to take accountability for that. Discuss laws against underage smoking - Learn what the laws are in your state regarding underage smoking and educate your teen about this too.</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">Be clear on the consequences - Parents can choose to restrict their teens' access to the internet, revoke phone privileges, reduce their allowance, or set an earlier curfew if they catch their teens smoking or smelling of cigarette smoke. Discuss these rules with your teen beforehand so that they know what's waiting for them if they wilfully disobey house rules. Talk to your teen - Punishments for teens can only go so far. Time will come when teens will eventually grow out of their fear of being punished by parents and realize that they can smoke if they want to. The best way to dissuade teens from smoking is to talk to them. It may be a series of talks, it may take a long time, but talking to them and telling them why you're so concerned about their smoking habits. Talk their language - At this stage in their life, teens are very concerned about how they look, how they smell, and how people perceive them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">It may be helpful to tell your teen about how teenage smoking will eventually ruin their skin, their teeth, and give them chronic halitosis. Talking to them about heart condition, cancer, emphysema and other illnesses may have an effect, but young people don't really tend to take these seriously because they don't feel the effects of smoking as much as older people do. As mentioned earlier, one of the best ways to help your teen quit smoking is to not smoke yourself. If you do smoke, seeing your doctor and asking for ways to help make quitting easier for you will help. It's also important to keep cigarettes where your teen won't reach them, and to not smoke where they will see you. A parent's example is a lot more compelling than their lectures will ever be. Like many other teenage disciplinary issues, convincing teens to stop smoking can be a challenge.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">If the habit is just starting out, parents contend with this idea in teens' heads that smoking makes them look cool and mature. There's also the extreme peer pressure that they are often subjected to. Teens often find their need to fit in to be a lot more compelling than their fear of their parents' anger. At times, teens even start smoking even if they don't really want to smoke because of peer pressure. Over time, the addiction takes hold of them and they keep on smoking. Quitting smoking is not easy for adults, so there's no reason to believe that it will be easy for teens too. Parents cannot make that decision for teens, and they can't always keep an eye on them, being already almost-adults.</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">Asserting a little authority helps, especially if they still live with you, but ultimately, it's important to give your teen the space they need to form their own decisions and realize the repercussions of these decisions on their own lives. Here are a few suggested punishments for teens and parenting tips in order to help stop teenage smoking: Hypnotherapy is a safe yet powerful therapeutic tool, and is great for helping people quit smoking, lose weight, remove phobias, and much more. During a hypnosis session, a hypnotherapist will guide a person into a trance. The conscious mind in tuned down a little, allowing for easier access to the subconscious mind. This is usually achieved with various visualisation exercises, guided by a slow and calming voice. Once the subject has achieved the trance state of mind, the hypnotherapist can then talk to the subconscious mind and tell it about the negative influences of smoking, and convince it to change.</paragraph><paragraph parID="192">After just one session hypnotherapy is often known to make significant and lasting changes. Not only will the subject know on a conscious level the negative effects of smoking, they will now understand on a subconscious level to. This can significantly quell those subconscious urges to smoke, since the subconscious mind now knows it is a negative thing to do. What is sometimes needed is some re programming, which is what hypnotherapy can do so quickly and effectively. If you want to quit smoking permanently then I highly recommend Jon Rhodes' revolutionary hypnotherapy audio programme Quit Smoking Hypnosis . This does work for a lot of people but may need perseverance to continue, if you should fall by the wayside, you might need further sessions. To help to make it work, you have to really want to stop smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">It is a good idea to try it for health and other psychological problems so long as you find the right therapist and go through the proper channels. This might require you consulting your doctor before undertaking this treatment. The therapeutic use of hypnosis is known as hypnotherapy. It actually has little in common with stage hypnosis, which is the use of hypnosis for entertainment purposes. Hypnotherapy works through subconscious communication. The subconscious part of the mind is the part responsible for our more automatic functions, such as heartbeat, breathing, sweating, emotions, and our habits and urges. Our conscious part is the more logical and analytical part of the mind.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">Since it is our subconscious mind that is responsible for our habits and urges, it is often not enough for a person to simply think that they should quit smoking on a conscious level. They may want to quit as they understand on a conscious level that smoking is bad for them. However it is the subconscious mind that will keep nagging away at them. In fact it can be so powerful that a person can literally go to a shop, buy a cigarette, and light it up all without conscious thought. It's almost like going on 'autopilot'. Only during or after the cigarette the new 'non smoker' may suddenly realise, "What the hell am I doing?" A person's subconscious mind also understand that smoking has a negative influence in order to stop these subconscious urges and actions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">One good way of achieving this is through hypnotherapy. This is not how it is portrayed in the media. A hypnotic trance is simply like a daydream or meditative state. Their subconscious mind is often unaware of the conscious desire to quit smoking. Of course this is no longer relevant as a person matures, yet the subconscious mind does not always know this. It has long been programmed by images of other 'cool' teenagers swaggering around with their 'grown up' cigarettes. It contains 5 hypnotic audio sessions that will help you before, during and after you have quit.</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">Comments for How Does Hypnotherapy Help People Quit Smoking? Hypnotherapy is good for other disorders as well. If we move forward with the legislation in the Senate and it does what it's supposed to do, it will stop about 60,000 children a year in Kentucky from beginning to use tobacco over the next five years. I don't believe that the Wildcats could have left all of their opponents gasping for breath, could have come from behind repeatedly to win the tournament, if their lungs had been incapacitated. After seeing two people close to her stricken with cancer, she and some of her friends decided to produce a video and a poster to help convince every student in her middle school understand the dangers of smoking. If you reduce teenage smoking, as is the right thing to do morally and from a health point of view and the law requires, it will reduce, sooner or later, the overall volume of tobacco required. Peer counseling with the Youth Quitline</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">Smoking is a complex social behavior. Different people take up their first cigarette for different reason, thus they call for different approaches to smoking cessation. Take teenage smoking as an example. Citing the latest (2010) data from the Thematic Household Survey of the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, 68.2% of daily smokers have in fact begun smoking before the age of 20. Since the prevalence of teenage smoking serves as an important indicator and determining factor of the future smoking population in society, it was therefore believed that to effectively curb smoking behavior in society, one has to start with the teenagers. In Hong Kong, the Youth Quitline, is a pioneering initiative of its kind, delivering telephone counseling services specifically catered to the needs of teenagers aged 12 to 25, smokers and non-smokers alike. As targets of the hotline are local teenagers in the city, the Quitline recruits students from the School of Medicine, School of Nursing and the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Hong Kong as peer counselors to help run the service.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">To become qualified counselors, these students are required to take courses relating to smoking, cessation services, counseling and psychology to broaden their understanding into the issue of teenage smoking and to learn the basics of counseling. Matthew Ho, a third year student from the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery at the University of Hong Kong, said he became a counselor to learn more about the stories of teenage smokers. It is commonly believed that smoking behavior is caused by peer pressure, family reasons and an individual's need to find a channel to vent emotions and alleviate stress. Based on his experiences as a counselor, Matthew points out that sometimes teenagers smoke because they do not have a positive attitude towards life. "We grew up in a healthy environment but not everyone is equally fortunate," said Matthew, "some teenagers do not view life positively and thus may easily commit to less desirable behavior such as smoking. My job, as a counselor, is therefore to understand their thoughts and behavior, to learn their attitude towards life and hopefully, to help them stay out of smoking. We have to find ways to change their patterns of cognitive thinking."</paragraph><paragraph parID="199">Counseling service with the Quitline is client-centered, tailored to the needs of each teenager. While there are no protocols guiding the counseling process, counselors in general conduct their work on the principle of 5As - ask, advice, assess, assist and arrange. Upon the teenagers' first call to the Quitline, it marks the beginning of a two-year service with the hotline. Three days after the first call, counselors would call the teenagers for follow up and usually six sessions of telephone counseling would at least be conducted in the first month to enhance the effectiveness of the counseling - a technique proven by empirical studies. The Quitline is reliant on self-reports. Therefore, once the teenager reports to the counselor that him or her did not smoke for seven consecutive days, the cessation would be regarded as successful. Based on the latest statistics, 24% of teenagers quit smoking upon six months of follow up and regular counseling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">At present, there are several approaches through which teenagers may reach the Quitline. So far, the Quitline has sent out its promotional materials and brochures to schools for General Education classes and in-school promotion. If the School finds a need for counseling services to its students, it may directly refer these cases to the hotline upon the consent of the teenagers. Yet more work has to be done. Celeste Tang, a year two student from the Master of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong and a counselor with the Quitline, said the biggest challenge faced by the Quitline is its lack of publicity. "Teenagers are more appealed to multimedia materials, graphics and creative presentation," said Celeste, "what we need to do now is to develop multimedia promotional materials that helps to bridge our gap with them." The Quitline is a collaboration between the Departments of Nursing Studies, Community Medicine and Social Work and Social Administration of the University of Hong Kong with the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">With the support from the Department of Health, it is now part of the Integrated Smoking Cessation Hotline of the Department of Health. About Jasmine Siu Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * The assessment of the course comes in two forms, pen-and-paper exam as well as practical examinations that require face-to-face counseling exercise. Students who expressed their interest in becoming counselors and have passed the exams are then qualified. It's a pity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="202">Meanwhile, the Quitline has published its own brochures and created a webpage to promote the hotline. As highlighted by Anita Chau, the coordinator of the Quitline, the hotline runs on limited resources and funding. As the production of promotional materials are often expensive, it becomes difficult for them to promote the Quitline. If there is a No Smoking policy, then the employee either will be less productive due to an inability to remain on task, or will "sneak off" to have a cigarette just as young teenagers sometimes do in Junior High and High School. Smoking unaffordable and uncool, say teenagers Smoking among 14- and 15-year-olds at its lowest in more than a decade, according to a new study. Smoking has become unaffordable and uncool for many teenagers, according to a new survey which shows the habit declining among the young.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">The annual Action on Smoke and Health (ASH) smoking survey 2010/2011, released today, shows smoking among 14- and 15-year-olds at its lowest since the survey began in 1999, and recorded the largest annual decline in daily smoking by youths since 2003/2004. It showed the number of daily smokers dropped from 5.5 per cent to 4.1 per cent over the period, and the number of regular smokers (daily, weekly or monthly) dropped from 10 per cent to 8.2 per cent of all students. "I think probably the biggest factor in terms of the reduction in youth smoking has been the recent tax increases. The tax on cigarettes has increased by about 30 per cent over the last 18 months, and I think that's had a huge impact because young smokers are especially sensitive to how much cigarettes cost." Society's perception around buying and smoking cigarettes was changing, with more communities and councils discussing smokefree zones, he said. The environment in which these young people are growing up and the way in which they are being exposed to tobacco and the risk factors around smoking is also undergoing a change, and I think that's influence which is trickling down to their behaviour. "The rates in which smoking is going down....are quite indicative that perhaps smoking is not as cool as it was, it's not being considered as an expression of being grown up and independent, but actually being independent is being able to make strong choices not to start smoking in the first place."</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">ASH director Ben Youdan put the drop in smoking levels across the board down to tax hikes. He said 14- and 15-year-olds were surveyed because that was the average age at which New Zealanders picked up the habit. The positive thing here is that we're seeing the biggest decline in smoking rates amongst Maori young people, and that inequalities gap is closing now." From July, cigarette companies are no longer allowed to have tobacco displays in shops. The Year 10 ASH Snapshot survey, sampling about half of all Year 10 students across the country, is the largest of its kind. "Almost every single smoker has started before they were 18. So surveying this age group is really important in terms of understanding about young people taking up smoking, the reasons they take up smoking, and helping us implement policies and campaigns which are going to help prevent them from starting in the first place."</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">Mr Youdan said the next survey would measure the impact that the disappearance of retail cigarette displays would have on smoking levels. So it's that time of year when parents and teenagers start the battle on exams and revision and it can be one of the most stressful times in the annual calendar as parents and teenagers know only too well. Unfortunately these can become over-exaggerated over time, even to the point where they begin to restrict a normal life. They had begun some horseplay and together rolled off the roof and onto the ground, neither was seriously hurt, though both would have been shocked, however the first words out of his brothers mouth were "you'll go to prison for that now!" Though the event was quickly forgiven and forgotten, years later the gentleman in question was in a real sense 'in prison', held back under lock and key by an irrational fear of flying (or more accurately, fear of falling). Originally all habits are intended to be useful. Many of the routine activities of our daily lives would become a nuisance if we had to consciously think them through each time we wanted to do them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">Alas this habit making force can turn against us, particularly when it comes to things like smoking or overeating but with hypnosis we can intervene and reprogram our unconscious minds with healthier requirements. The power of hypnosis is quite literally the power of habit and we all know how strong that can be! Most marketing funds are now spent on price discounts, and the report argues that these are especially enticing to kids because they are more price-sensitive. Making cigarettes less affordable and less accessible will help to reduce the amount of teen smoking. If you want kids to stop smoking, use reverse psychology. Teens and tobacco Realistic ways to discourage kids' smoking</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">If you go to the website of the Surgeon General of the United States (surgeongeneral.gov), you can see a new public service announcement featuring teenagers in a cemetery, talking about the harmful consequences of smoking. The ad accompanies a new report which laments the stalled progress against adolescent tobacco use. Smoking is often an act of youthful rebellion, and it's the nature of rebellious youth that the more they are told something is bad for them, the more they want to do it. Efforts to inform kids about the hazards of tobacco are worthwhile, but only among kids who are open to such messages. After all, as the surgeon general acknowledges, "the Master Settlement Agreement with the tobacco companies in 1998 resulted in the elimination of billboard and transit advertising, eliminated print advertising that directly targeted underage youth, and limited the use of brand advertising." But keep in mind that no one under age 18 is legally allowed to purchase tobacco products anymore. And money-saving promotions are a reasonable tool for capturing market share among adult smokers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">If you think advertising is the culprit, keep in mind that cigarettes are now less popular with high school seniors than marijuana - and pot doesn't have a $10 billion marketing budget. It's tempting to blame Big Tobacco for corrupting kids. So what can be done about teen smoking? It's wise to accept the limits of anti-tobacco efforts. The administration's dream "to make the next generation tobacco-free" is unrealistic, given that some kids will always want to take needless risks. One is tightening enforcement of laws against selling tobacco to minors - with prosecution of adults who buy smokes for high school students. Another is raising taxes on these products.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids says research suggests that a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes cuts kids' smoking by about 7 percent. Convince them its good to smoke, and that proper young men and women do it. Show them pictures of formally dressed and very uncool looking teenagers smoking. They will then want nothing to do with it. Accoriding to the data presented in the article, I guess that witch hunt against Joe Camel, and other advertisements, didn't have quite the effect that some people thought it would. There is a new medicine treatment for smoking addiction that is also an effective antidepressant. Bupropion (Zyban&#8482;) is a safe and effective, non-nicotine treatment for smoking which lessens withdrawal symptoms, prevents weight gain and improves mood in most patients.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">The following strategies address the need to make physical activity a relevant alternative for young women and to reduce smoking with action in three areas: Prevention, Protection and Cessation. It is also time to seriously explore how physical activity might serve as a viable alternative to smoking in young women's lives. Physical activity has the potential to be a healthy and enjoyable alternative to smoking that meets young women's immediate needs. Perceived Benefits of Smoking Known Benefits of Physical Activity Many teen women see smoking as a way to relax and deal with stress Physical activity can help buffer the effects of stress anxiety and depression.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">Smoking is viewed as a way to make friends and be accepted by yours peers. Group activities and team sports offer the chance to make friends and develop meaningful relationships with peers and caring adults. Smoking is seen as a way to gain independence from parents and to rebel against social pressures to be feminine, perfect and nice. Sports and activities such as skating, rock and wall climbing, soccer, hockey, rowing, windsurfing and snowboarding offer a healthy way to rebel against social pressures to assume a passive female role. Disadvantaged teen women may see cigarettes as a status symbol. Cigarettes provide a substitute for a lack of material possessions and make them feel less deprived. Membership on a sport team or in a sports club offers status.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">Most teenagers perceive athletes to be successful and well liked. Participation in high school athletics may be particularly helpful to improving the status of teenagers girls from minority groups. Smoking is perceived as an appropriate way to control weight. Regular physical activity is essential to maintaining a healthy weight. Two Other Benefits of Physical Activity Are: The positive influence of role modeling by peer athletes, experiencing female athletes, coaches, teachers and activity leaders. The positive influence on self-esteem of participation in physical activity and sport.</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">Adolescent women use smoking to: deal with stress and negative emotions and to cope with difficult life circumstances gain status or acceptance with peers be like the glamorous, thin, successful and seductive images they see in movies, music videos and advertising control their weight rebel against societal pressures to be feminine, perfect and nice all the time. Taking Action</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">Smoking, like the choice to be physically active, is the result of a complex mix of broad environmental factors, social pressures and individual experiences. Parents, teachers, coaches and leaders can have an important influence at the individual level. But we must also work together to change inequities in the social and political environments that affect young women's choices. Prevention Strategies for Parents, Coaches, Teachers, Leaders and Organizations Organize noncompetitive or nontraditional activities to attract girls who do not normally participate and may be at high risk for smoking. Offer activity programs that build young women's self-esteem, self-empowerment, independence and stress management skills. Ask young women what kinds of activities they would like to try.</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">Offer a broad range of activities or contract local programs and clubs that are willing to introduce adolescent women to new activities, e.g. orienteering, hiking, climbing, archery, etc. Boycott sporting events with tobacco sponsorship. Encourage young women to join you in protesting tobacco sponsorships. Insist that young women get their fair share of facilities and equipment. Ask for qualified instructors to ensure that they learn the skills they will need to lead an active lifestyle in the future. Promote the immediate benefits of physical activity (they are the same as the perceived benefits of smoking). Counter the tobacco industry's use of of sporting images to associate smoking with independence and adventure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">Encourage female role models in all aspects of sport and active living to speak out against smoking and the exploitation tactics of the tobacco industry. Include relevant information on smoking in sport and active living newsletters and promotional material. Be a positive role model by staying active and refraining from smoking. If you do smoke, talk about your addiction and your efforts to quite. Remove any emphasis on weight control and "ideal" body sculpting in Physical education, sport and recreational activities. Encourage healthy eating, positive body image and enjoyable physical activity at home, at school and in the community. Advocate woman-centred interventions in smoking prevention and physical activity promotion as part of a comprehensive school health program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">Ensure that school health curricula deal with and link the issues of body image, self-esteem, eating disorders, smoking and physical activity. Support school programs in media literacy that show adolescent women how the tobacco and other industries exploit women and children. Help young women decode ads at home. Support increased tobacco taxation and advocate strict penalties for those who sell tobacco to minors. Work with health and women's groups on this issue. Talk to them about the potential of active living and sport to address smoking. Seek their support on issues such as quality, daily physical education and gender equity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">But a worrying new study reveals that smoking infront of children not only passes on the harmful effects of the smoke in the air - it can also get them hooked on cigarettes. A Concordia and University of Montreal study published in the Oxford journal Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research, found that tweens who repeatedly observe a parent, sibling, friend or neighbur consuming cigarettes are more likely to start smoking themselves. Worrying: A new study reveals that smoking infront of children not only passes on the harmful effects of the smoke in the air - it can also get them hooked on cigarettes 'Kids who see others smoking are more likely to take up the habit because they don't perceive cigarettes as unhealthy,' says lead study author Simon Racicot, of Concordia University's Department of Psychology. 'Therefore, smoking by parents, siblings, and friends increases risk factors for later smoking.' The researchers argue that new prevention efforts must be tailored to children who are highly exposed to secondhand smoke - ensuring they are aware of the risks. " tweens who repeatedly observe a parent, sibling or neighbour smoking are more likely to start smoking themselves " On the other hand if they see their old Gran or their elderly neighbour smoking, they may be inclined to wonder why we,re constantly fed all this twaddle.</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">After a fairly harrowing year which has involved her lying on numerous occasions, holding a party with alcohol without adult supervision (one of the occasions when there was some major lying going on), getting drunk, smoking and, apparently, on one occasion trying weed not realising what it was "but I didn't like it"), I have put some non-negotiable rules in place. If you need help keep asking, you'll get the advice, don't suffer in silence. It's a hard and lonely thing to do which is why you need the support of other parents! If you smoke then the best thing that you can do to improve your health is to quit. You can treat many of these conditions with herbal and other remedies, but any approach needs to start with removing the underlying cause of the problem - cigarette smoking. All of my recommendations for treating (and preventing) these conditions will include 'do not smoke'.

The inference is that the "smoking didn't hurt him" and he is old - so it may not happen to them. RIP - and let's hope she didn't die in vain i.e I hope it sends a very real message to other teenagers that drugs aren't really that cool - just like playing russian roulette - some are lucky, some are not. it is really sad this has happened, and i hope it hits home to all other teenagers that drugs, including alcohol, can kill. Without wishing to pre-judge the circumstances of her death I question how many more before the message gets through that drugs can kill the first time they are used. This is a very sad tragedy, but for all the people that are having a dig because she MAY have taken drugs, it must be remembered that more people die from alcohol (a drug) than all the illegal drugs put together. I hope other teenages realise what can happen when taking drugs now, and hopefully they will think it through more thurely.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">Gabi was a lovely warm hearted teenager, with a bright future in front of her, everything to live for.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley wants this to change - and believes the steps set out in his tobacco control strategy will help. He has set "national ambitions" to reduce smoking in adults from 21.2% to 18.5% by 2015.</paragraph><paragraph parID="223">There are specific goals for teenagers and pregnant women too. Smoking in numbers More than a fifth of adults in England smoke - down from nearly a half in the 1970s Despite it being illegal for under 18s to buy cigarettes, one in seven 15-year-olds say they are regular smokers Some 63% of smokers say they would like to quit, but over half cannot go a day without lighting up How do I stop smoking? It's not easy to stop smoking once you've started.</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">Some people can quit "cold turkey" (stop abruptly), but most people need some help. You can ask your health professional about using a nicotine substitute while you're trying to quit. A nicotine substitute, such as nicotine gum or a nicotine patch , keeps you from feeling sick from nicotine withdrawal. Once you have kicked the smoking habit, you can gradually decrease the amount of nicotine substitute without getting any symptoms at all. If you can quit smoking, you'll notice benefits within a few days. Within 24 hours your lungs will start to repair the damage caused by smoking. Soon you'll notice that you have more stamina and can do more without getting short of breath.</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">Smoking: Crush the Butts What is smoking? Smoking tobacco is a habit practiced by more than 4 million teenagers. Smoking causes serious health problems and kills almost 400,000 people each year. It's very addictive and most people find it very difficult to stop. More than 90% of adult smokers started when they were teenagers. back to top</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">Why do teens smoke? Most teens start smoking because they think it makes them look more like adults. Many teens want to defy the authority of their parents or other adults. They're usually told not to smoke, so they might feel like they're acting independent if they do it anyway. Most teens find smoking unpleasant at first. The smoke often irritates the nose and mouth and makes them nauseated and dizzy. You really have to make an effort if you want to get used to smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="227">And if you do, it won't take very long to become addicted. What happens to my body if I smoke? The biggest effect of smoking is on your lungs . Tobacco smoke contains many different chemicals that irritate the lining of your lungs. The long-term consequences of smoking include lung cancer and emphysema . Smoking causes damage even in the short term. It will affect your ability to play sports because you'll get short of breath sooner and have less stamina .</paragraph><paragraph parID="228">If you haven't finished growing, smoking may limit your height. There are other long-term effects besides lung diseases. Smoking also causes cancer of the mouth, larynx , and bladder . In females, smoking increases the chances of getting cancer of the cervix . Another side effect is financial. Smoking is an expensive habit&#151;it can quickly cost $20 a week. That's more than $1,000 a year up in smoke.</paragraph><paragraph parID="229">Why do people get addicted to smoking? Tobacco smoke contains a chemical called nicotine . Nicotine is absorbed by the lungs and transported to the brain. Many smokers feel that nicotine helps them concentrate. But actually, nicotine hurts them much more than it helps them, because it is very addictive. Once you are addicted and you stop smoking, you'll get a number of unpleasant symptoms when you stop taking nicotine into your body. These symptoms include:</paragraph><paragraph parID="230">upset stomach These symptoms are not fun, which makes it very hard to quit smoking. According to its figures, more than 300,000 children aged under 16 try smoking each year and 5% of children aged 11 to 15 are regular smokers. About 39% of smokers say they were smoking regularly before the age of 16. Lansley dismissed the suggestion that smoking could become more attractive to young people if it was kept hidden and insisted the key issue was about "shifting the culture". "The culture is about moving to a place where tobacco and smoking isn't part of normal life: people don't encounter it normally, they don't see it in their big supermarkets, they don't see people smoking in public places, they don't see tobacco vending machines. "We are going to continue to try to act against smoking for the simple reason that most smokers want to quit and it is the biggest avoidable cause of early mortality."</paragraph><paragraph parID="231">The health minister, Anne Milton, said: "We cannot ignore the fact that young people are recruited into smoking by colourful, eye-catching, cigarette displays. "Most adult smokers started smoking as teenagers and we need to stop this trend. Banning displays of cigarettes and tobacco will help young people resist the pressure to start smoking and help the thousands of adults in England who are currently trying to quit." I spent the afternoon wandering around the square mile in the City of London yesterday and was thinking that the reverse is true - smoking is certainly a part of life for many people in many stratas of society. Objectively I think most people would agree he is right (on health, financial etc grounds, smoking doesn't seem to be a very good lifestyle choice) - and yet he is clearly wrong in that many many people still have smoking as a integral part of life. Lansley is not stupid enough to believe that teenagers will not start smoking because of this idiotic scheme but he thinks voters are stupid enough to believe it a good thing, perhaps he's right, he did get voted in after all. The legislation means that from Friday all large shops and supermarkets in England must hide cigarettes and tobacco products from public view.</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">"It's also about supporting smokers who want to give up," Lansley told BBC Breakfast. We want to continue to increase that proportion, help more people to stop." The Department of Health said the move was in response to evidence that cigarette displays in shops can encourage young people to take up the habit. Jean King, of Cancer Research UK, told the programme: "We want everything we can possibly do to make cigarettes unavailable and inaccessible and something that children don't see as a normal product." She said there was "no positive use" for tobacco and no known safe level of use, adding: "We need to do everything we can to prevent young people getting hold of cigarettes." All tobacco products must be kept out of sight except when staff are serving customers or carrying out other day-to-day tasks, such as restocking. They should have taken this measure years ago.</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">I'm in my first year of quitting. I feel great for stopping and have overcome the cravings now. "We no longer see smoking as part of life". Smoking is undesirable &amp; I stopped it way back, but it is part of the way that millions of people live. For the moment people still have the choice to indulge in this nasty, expensive and unpleasant habit, but so far as I am concerned the less they are encouraged to do so the better. I, most of my friends - even my mother - have stopped smoking since the ban and we're all happy we did, we all found it easy and we all wish we'd done it years ago. None of us would say we gave up because of the ban, but we quickly got used to not smoking in pubs etc., we all drifted into a policy of no smoking in our houses and we all decided we'd had enough within 5 years of the ban being implemented - so it probably did have the desired effect.</paragraph><paragraph parID="234">Smoking is a major problem among teenagers. By law you shouldn't smoke until you are sixteen. Many teenagers have either tried smoking or are addicted to it before they are sixteen. Some teenagers are social smokers . They only smoke when they're out with their friends. Social smoking can still lead to an addiction. A lot of teenagers don't think of the long-term effects smoking can have.</paragraph><paragraph parID="235">Peer pressure is a main cause of smoking. Teenagers think that smoking will impress their friends, make them look good and help them to fit in. If you don't smoke your friends could offer you a cigarette, telling you it will help you to relax or it could help you to loose weight. Peer pressure can be unbelievably hard to cope with. Whether you decide to smoke or not should be your decision, not your friends. Most people who smoke end up regretting it and it's likely that your friends will too. It's extremely easy to become addicted to smoking, it's also extremely hard to give it up.</paragraph><paragraph parID="236">They could also tell you that if you try it and you don't like it you could just give it up. It is hard to give up smoking but it can be done. If you want to give up smoking you can call the NHS for advice free on 0800 169 0169. If you or anybody you know are having problems with smoking try the following places for help and support @ the Addictions Links Page. Smoking and giving up The helpline can give you advice if you're finding giving up tough and has details of support groups in your area that you might want to join. The number is 0800 169 0 169, all calls are free and it's open from 7.00 am to 11.00 pm.</paragraph><paragraph parID="237">Patches and gum But if you want to give up, there's lots of help available. This is to try to stop people starting to smoke as teenagers. It's been estimated that people who start smoking at 15 are three times more likely to die from cancer than someone who starts in their twenties. Even though we all know about the health risks connected to smoking, thousands of people decide to start every year - and a large number of adults who carry on smoking say that they started when they were under 16. You may be pressured into starting by some of your friends, you may want to copy older relatives who smoke or you may just be curious about what it's like. Whatever sort of pressure you're put under, it's a lot easier to say no than taking up the habit and trying to give up after years of regular smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="238">It also costs a lot of money. If you get through ten cigarettes a day, it costs over &#163;1,200 every year. Think of all the stuff you could buy with that money! The health risks you might think that you'll give up when you're a bit older, but the longer you carry on smoking, the harder it will be to quit the only way smoking makes you look older is by giving you wrinkles at an early age Ways to give up</paragraph><paragraph parID="239">If you've decided to kick the smoking habit, there are a number of things you can do that can make giving up a little easier. Help over the phone The National Health Service (NHS) runs a smoking helpline that helps thousands of people quit every year. And so I think we do a huge disservice to young people as adults who really are trusted messengers by giving them that message, which is false. We know that policies that are effective include 100 percent smoke-free policies in public places, higher cigarette prices, use of media and counteradvertising, access to cessation services and treatments, and, very importantly, well-funded state-based tobacco control programs. And so the rule, among other things, prohibits sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to kids younger than 18, prohibits the sale of cigarette packs with fewer than 20 cigarettes, prohibits distribution or free samples of cigarettes, and prohibits tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic, musical or other social or cultural event. What is remarkable, in my perspective, from what we are observing on Monitoring the Future, is that there is a significant decrease in the use of cigarette smoking among teenagers, 8th and 12th graders.</paragraph><paragraph parID="240">That's actually quite important because cigarette smoking of course has very adverse medical consequences, but also the use of cigarettes by adolescents increases the risk to addiction to nicotine on the one hand, but also there is increasing evidence that it may be priming them for the rewarding effects of other drugs of abuse, including daily substances. So the decline in cigarette smoking is likely to have downstream consequences, both in medical health as well as substance use disorders. For example, smokeless tobacco is actually, among the 12th graders in the past month, is 8.2 percent, which is actually quite high. And there are other tobacco products like cigarettes- cigars, that are being used by young people, highlighting the importance of prevention strategies to go after these products. On the other hand, on the negative side of things, in the arena of marijuana, over the past five years we have seen trending towards increases on marijuana utilization, particularly among 10th and 12th graders. This is, of the indicators, the one that actually highlighted in my brain as one that tells us that we cannot become complacent about it, is that we have the highest rates on every day marijuana smoking among 12th graders since 1981. Six-point-six percent of 12th graders are smoking marijuana daily, regularly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="241">Among 12th graders, past-year use of these synthetic cannabinoids is 11.3 percent. That is 1 in 9 teenagers- 12th graders have tried these synthetic cannabinoids in the past year, so highlighting the need to actually do interventions to not just go in terms of the adverse effects of marijuana search but the synthetic cannabinoids. Eight-point-two percent of 12th graders admit to the use of Vicodin, which is a pain medication containing opiates in the past year; 8.1 percent- 8.3 percent admit to the use of amphetamines, which is a stimulant medication regularly used for the treatment of ADHD that has been diverted not just to get high but actually to improve cognitive performance. So as a strategy, what NIDA is doing is relaunching an updated version of its website for own prescription, targeted towards teenagers to provide information, PEERx, to actually expand the knowledge about what we know on the adverse effects of psychotherapeutics. And the data being presented today suggests that a considerable amount of experimental use of hookahs and more than a quarter of 12th graders who are boys are using small cigars. We need to stress today that these products are not safe alternatives to cigarettes, and in fact, collectively they represent yet another gateway to addiction. So we must scale up our tobacco control efforts to address this growing portfolio of changes, and one way we can do that is to do that through robust FDA regulatory action.</paragraph><paragraph parID="242">And, very importantly for this presentation, the law also permits the FDA to issue regulation to extend its jurisdiction over other tobacco products, a process called deeming. In the spring of this year, 2011, the FDA announced their intention to exercise this authority by issuing a regulation to extend its jurisdiction over other tobacco products, including little cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah water pipes, dissolvables and e-cigarettes. So I'm not a doctor. (Laughter.) But I'm very honored to be here with Dr. Volkow, who's been a good friend and a good colleague on these issues for me in the two and a half years that I've been here, and certainly to my friend and colleague, Dr. Howard Koh, who has shown such leadership in this particular area. This is an important survey. I think from our standpoint, from the standpoint of the White House, I think the information that's provided is so critical because it really keeps us connected with the future of this country, and the future of this country is certainly in our teenagers, those kids that we want to see highly educated and want to see working and want to see performing well to all of their potential.</paragraph><paragraph parID="243">And that's why every year when this information comes out it is of great value and great assistance to policymakers. And despite the increases in drug use over the past several years, over the long term the rates of drug use among youth today are lower than they were at that time, those decades ago. The president has already noted that we have changed attitudes in this country regarding the rates of smoking. Many of those things were highlighted by Dr. Koh and Dr. Volkow. And we've changed perceptions in the way- again, in partnership with a lot of other people- the way we look at drunk driving or alcohol-impaired driving in this country. It impairs the ability of many of our citizens to reach their full potential. Drug problems hit young people particularly hard, and they are at a vulnerable stage of their development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="244">Monitoring the Future gives us that kind of information as policymakers. The good news is that today's results show that, again, we're not really powerless against teen drug use. Dr. Volkow talked about smoking and drinking now at historic lows. We have to give kids the right message. We have to be clear about our messages. But I'm happy to say that this year we've actually observed continuing decline in all three grades. One that is statistically significant- and if I average across the three grades, we've gone from 13 percent indicating smoking in the past month down to 12 (percent).</paragraph><paragraph parID="245">And it brings their smoking rates in all three grades to historic lows within the life of the study. So I think that's a very important development and I can't even begin to tell you how many premature deaths have been prevented by this substantial decline in smoking and how many serious diseases like lung cancer and heart disease have been prevented. So I think it's a very, very important development both that there has been this large decline and that it's still continuing because we were fearful that it may not. Still, we have on the order of 19 percent of our high school seniors indicating that in the past month they have smoked cigarettes to some degree. And that, as Dr. Koh suggests, is still not an acceptable level for a behavior that we know has the personal and social costs of cigarette smoking. There's been a fairly steady decline since then with one major exception and that was in the early '90s, the first half of the '90s when illicit drug use went up. So to summarize, cigarettes and alcohol use are declining and are at historically low levels.</paragraph><paragraph parID="246">"Having been a smoker for 20 years and tried various techniques (patches, gum, etc.) I thought I would give Hypnotherapy a go. Ten months later I am still not smoking thanks Maria. I must admit I was a bit of cynic before my meeting with Maria. In a very relaxed environment Maria talked me through the pros (not many) and cons (many) of smoking. To anyone thinking of using this method to give up smoking good luck ...... Teen smoking , admit it or not, exists. In an attempt to impede the continuous growth of teen smokers, the government of the United States of America has made the initiative to provide health warnings on cigarette packs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="247">"Smoking is detrimental to health" The government requires images that show health risks of smoking, with varying texts such as "Don't let children breathe your smoke". Then, why does this become a continuous problem? Aside from alcohol and drugs, cigarette is considered a highly addictive substance. Many of those who have tried smoking made a habit out of it and could not stop it despite the numerous attempts that they have initiated. One of the more bothering aspects of this problem is the fact that it is affecting the adolescents of today, as well. Teenagers today have gained unlimited access to cigarette, and hence, developed the vice of smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="248">This scenario shifted the whole smoking issue into a social concern, rather than just an individual health concern. The main reason why this problem has even existed is the society allowed it. With social permissiveness and negligence, there was great failure in restricting adolescents in accessing such substances. Moreover, statistics have shown that teenagers who are smokers have been exposed to family members who are smokers, as well. From this, it can be deduced that society, and more so the family, breeds teenagers who become smokers. With this information established and these facts presented, it is only natural for the society to enact on it. What makes teen smoking a more depressing thought than mere smoking is the age factor.</paragraph><paragraph parID="249">It is an established fact that smoking can cause several types of illnesses and diseases. The numerous health advisories provided by public and private institutions establishes the risk of an adult smoker. These risks range from mere halitosis to life threatening lung cancer. Naturally, these health risks are not only applicable to the adult group but more so with the adolescent group as they are more susceptible, when health matters are concerned. As pioneers of this movement, the USA has continuously changed their standards in printing the warning to accommodate the requirements of the society. In 1966, cigarette manufacturers were required to print Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health on the carton. Fro m decade to decade, the print has changed and been modified to incorporate the details of the risks, as illustrated by health practitioners.</paragraph><paragraph parID="250">By 2012, tobacco companies will be required to print picture warnings on their label - covering 50% of each pack.

Smoking in films encourages teenagers to take a drag Ever since the era of silent films, smoking has played a major part in film symbolism. But iconic scenes such as these could be damaging the health of teenagers, who are more likely to smoke after watching films depicting the habit. New research from the University of Bristol has revealed that 15-year-olds who saw the most films showing smoking were 73 per cent more likely to have tried a cigarette than those exposed to the least.</paragraph><paragraph parID="255">They were also almost 50 per cent more likely to be a current smoker than those least exposed. And even after taking account of alcohol use and smoking among their peers, both of which are known to influence initiation of smoking, these teenagers were still 32 per cent more likely to have tried a cigarette themselves. The findings have prompted calls for film makers, regulators and politicians to review their policies on film classification for movies which glamorise smoking. Research in the US has shown that films depict smoking as an attractive behaviour rather than associating it with negative outcomes, such as ill health, making it similar to aspirational tobacco advertising imagery which is banned in the UK. Adolescents in the US with high exposure to films showing smoking are two to three times more likely to start smoking than others, even after other factors such as alcohol use and peer pressure are taken into account. The study, using data collected from the Children of the 90s project, looked at 5,166 15-year-olds and asked whether they had seen 50 films which were randomly selected from 366 box office hits released between 2001 and 2005 and compared these findings with whether they had ever tried a cigarette or were current smokers. Dr Waylen, from the School of Oral and Dental Sciences , said: "More than half the films shown in the UK that contain smoking are rated UK15 or below, so children and young teenagers are clearly exposed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="256">"Our results confirm an association between this exposure and youth smoking in this country, indicating that raising the certification to 18 in the UK is likely to lower smoking rates among youth. "Given that smoking depictions in films are not consistent with the ban on smoking in public places in the UK and that the relationship may be causal, a precautionary principle should be pursued. Films ought to be rated by exposure to smoking in the same way that they are currently rated by level of violence. Smoking and its adverse consequences are certainly a larger public health problem. Such a policy would also make the movie ratings system consistent with the ban on tobacco advertising in all other media." Actress Audrey Hepburn smoking in the film Charade Image by Wikimedia Commons Our results confirm an association between this exposure and youth smoking in this country, indicating that raising the certification to 18 in the UK is likely to lower smoking rates among youth</paragraph><paragraph parID="257">The UK Centre for Tobacco Control Studies wants such films to fall under the same stringent rules applied to films showing violence and sex, arguing that children need to be protected from potentially harmful imagery. In response to the allegation that current practice in film classification is failing to protect children from "this potential harmful imagery", the BBFC told the authors that their guidelines were "proportionate; take due account of the available evidence of harm; and reflect the clear wishes of the public". Because the bodies on display are all under fifty years of age and many died from smoking related illnesses, the anti-smoking message is one of the strongest. The blackened smoker's lungs is (sic) a stark reminder to a smoker that it might be time to quit. WAYNE CASTLE: The number of people who see the exhibits here and look at the smoking related diseases and the smoking related pathology, the number of people here who walk out saying "that's it, I'm throwing my cigarettes away", and even the general manager of the venue here has vowed he'll never smoke again. So the impact as far as an anti-smoking campaign (and we're being very subtle about it) it is really quite amazing. People walk out of here and saying "everybody should see this, every school child should see this, every smoker should see this".</paragraph><paragraph parID="258">IAN HENSCHKE: Because this is the first time a display like this has ever toured Australia, a lot of schools were keen for their students to see it, but there was some concern that it might be too confronting for teenagers. ANDREW FOOTNER (Teacher): We had to make sure that the parents were aware of what was here and the nature of it, so that they realised that they were real human bodies that they were coming to see and that the type of display that they had was educational rather than a gory type of setting that some people might construe it as. IAN HENSCHKE: Despite the concerns that it might be upsetting for some of the younger visitors, the reactions were more of wonderment and fascination rather than worry and fear. IAN HENSCHKE: Do you think any of the students are upset by the fact that there are 18 dead bodies on display? We only have one body, one chance at life, we're all basically the same and in the end we all end up at the same destination. If recent research is to believed, Britain's teenagers are now more sensible - or boring - than any previous generation. As for that staple of my youth: cigarettes in the bike sheds - the 2010 survey showed that 27 per cent had smoked once in their lives, and five per cent smoked regularly (more than once a week).</paragraph><paragraph parID="259">In 1982, 53 per cent of an equivalent group had tried smoking and 11 per cent smoked regularly. Public health officials said the results                    prove that the Massachusetts tobacco control program is                    having a big impact. The program, one of the nation's biggest state efforts to                    counter tobacco advertising, funds 44 youth programs                    across the state and 273 local boards of health that              promote clean indoor air and put pressure on tobacco                    retailers not to sell cigarettes to minors. "If you want to reduce youth smoking, you have to                    denormalize smoking,'' said Connolly.  " Kids benefitted                    from higher prices, clean indoor air, an aggressive media                    campaign and advertising restrictions.'' FOURTH: If you are quite serious in eliminating child and teen tobacco use, there is one single step you can take that is the most important one, the cheapest one, and the most effective one of all. This foundation can recommend increasing protections afforded under the Virginia Indoor Clean Air Act by requiring that all workplaces ban smoking on the workplace site.</paragraph><paragraph parID="260">This would help children, teenagers, adults, and the fetus, because it would immediately provide: a healthier work environment; protect the civil rights of the nonsmoker; promote a positive image that not-smoking is the example to follow; teens who smoke would be encouraged to quit smoking; exemplify the policy that one should not hurt another person; and break the vicious, undermining, "double-speak" cycle.</paragraph><paragraph parID="261">Incentives, such as tax credits, should be offered to businesses which have eliminated workplace smoking by the end of this year. Eliminating smoking in the workplace and stopping the onscreen smoking will be the most effective efforts you can ever take to stop tobacco use among children and teenagers. In 1998, a federal judge found the Environmental Protection Agency made                       scientific mistakes when drafting a 1992 report that declared as many as                       3,000 lung cancer deaths each year resulted from secondhand smoke. VIRGINIA -- November 12, 2002 -- The Joint Rules Committee of the Virginia General Assembly has placed itself above the rights of citizens who seek equal access to their legislators at a tax supported building. The tobacco industry does not want young people to see that smoking is so dangerous, it can even kill you through breathing someone else's smoke. The tobacco industry does not want young people to think that it is "normal" to have NO SMOKING in the workplace, in restaurants, and so on. The risks of exposing children to passive smoking are already well-documented but until now, a direct link between passive smoking and asthma in adults has not been proven.</paragraph><paragraph parID="262">Furthermore, it sets a good example for the young, by showing them that smoking is so dangerous, it can even hurt you secondhand. There is a great problem with "double speak" - when we tell young people that tobacco use is bad for them, but then allow others to blow smoke in their faces. Smoking among Massachusetts adolescents                    has dropped faster since 1996 than at any other time in                    state history, public health officials reported Wednesday,                    led by sixth graders who had a 70 percent drop in their                    use of cigarettes. The 24 percent overall decline in cigarette use among                    youth in grades seven through 12 is especially impressive,                    said Public Health Commissioner Howard Koh, because it              came at a time when tobacco companies are spending                    more to attract young smokers . There may be many things that people will accept secondhand -- but smoke is NOT one of them. Tobacco Smoke is so dangerous, it can even kill secondhand. Tobacco companies do not allow smoking around tobacco seedlings -- because it kills them -- tobacco mosaic virus.</paragraph><paragraph parID="263">Tomato plants are also susceptible to this. People are also hurt and killed by secondhand smoke. Carcinogens are cancer producing substances. Environmental Tobacco Smoke [ETS], or secondhand smoke, is the third leading cause of preventable disease, disability and death in the U.S.A.; the first is active smoking, the second is alcohol use. ETS is the single most important source of harmful indoor air pollution. Every year at least 1000 people die from the effects of passive smoking. When smokers decide to quit they are often advised to set a date, bin the fags and then just do it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="264">Support from a doctor or health professional during this time can be invaluable. LUNG CANCER "I have had three confirmed cases of inoperable primary lung cancer in life-long non-smokers in the last two years. The biopsies showed the type of lung cancer only seen in smokers, and all three worked in public places where they were heavily exposed to secondary cigarette smoke. All three died within weeks of diagnosis." RESPIRATORY DISEASE "I have recently seen a thirty-four year old landlady with severe bronchial irritation and a history of recurrent wheezy chest infections caused by her work environment in a smoky pub. She now needs regular inhaled drugs including steroids to control her symptoms. She herself has never smoked."</paragraph><paragraph parID="265">CHILDREN "I saw a young boy on a number of occasions suffering from severe asthma attacks. His mother said she could not think of anything that brought on the attack, but the young boy said 'I always get sick after seeing grandad'. Apparently his grandfather owns a small and usually smoke filled restaurant." PREGNANCY "In my current post in obstetrics I see numerous cases of low-birthweight babies and difficult pregnancies exacerbated by passive smoking." The BMA has been calling for legislation to ban smoking in enclosed public places since 1986. For this reason, more and more workplaces are going smoke-free around the world. Environmental tobacco smoke linked to reading, math, logic, and reasoning declines in children Press release from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center January 4, 2005</paragraph><paragraph parID="266">CINCINNATI - A new Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center study shows that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, even at extremely low levels, is associated with decreases in certain cognitive skills, including reading, math, and logic and reasoning, in children and adolescents. The study is the largest ever to look at the effects of environmental tobacco smoke on children's health. "This study provides further incentive for states to set public health standards to protect children from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke," says Kimberly Yolton, PhD, a researcher at the Children's Environmental Health Center at Cincinnati Children's and the study's main author. "We estimate that more than 33 million children in the United States are exposed to levels consistent with the adverse effects seen in this study." "These declines may not be clinically meaningful for an individual child, but they have huge implications for our society because millions of children are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in the United States," says Dr. Yolton. To measure exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, researchers measured levels of cotinine, a substance produced when nicotine is broken down by the body. Cotinine can be measured in blood, urine, saliva and hair.</paragraph><paragraph parID="267">It is considered the best marker of environmental tobacco smoke exposure. For this study, cotinine was measured in the blood of 4,399 children between 6 and 16 years old. Children were only included in the analysis if their serum (blood) cotinine levels were at or below 15 ng/ml, a level consistent with environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and if they denied using any tobacco products in the previous five days. Reading, math and reasoning scores were highly related to environmental tobacco smoke exposure: The greater the levels of exposure as measured by cotinine levels, the greater the decline in reading and reasoning ability, even at extremely low levels of exposure, according to Dr. Yolton. Surprisingly, Dr. Yolton and colleagues at Cincinnati Children's also found greater decreases in cognitive skills at lower levels of exposure. While there was, on average, a one-point decline in reading scores for each unit increase in cotinine at levels above 1 ng/ml, there was a five-point decline for each unit increase in cotinine at levels below 1 ng/ml. In the United States, 43 percent of children are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in their own homes, and 85 percent of children have detectable levels of cotinine in their blood.</paragraph><paragraph parID="268">Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Cognitive Abilities among U.S. Children and Adolescents Environmental Health Perspectives Volume 113, Number 1 January 2005 Kimberly Yolton,1,2 Kim Dietrich,1,3 Peggy Auinger,4 Bruce P. Lanphear,1,2 and Richard Hornung1,3,4 We used the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), conducted from 1988 to 1994, to investigate the relationship between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and cognitive abilities among U.S. children and adolescents 6-16 years of age. Serum cotinine was used as a biomarker of ETS exposure. Children were included in the sample if their serum cotinine levels were 15 ng/mL, a level consistent with ETS exposure, and if they denied using any tobacco products in the previous 5 days. Analyses were conducted using SUDAAN software. Of the 5,365 6- to 16-year-olds included in NHANES III, 4,399 (82%) were included in this analysis. The geometric mean serum cotinine level was 0.23 ng/mL (range, 0.035-15 ng/mL); 80% of subjects had levels &lt; 1 ng/mL.</paragraph><paragraph parID="269">After adjustment for sex, race, region, poverty, parent education and marital status, ferritin, and blood lead concentration, there was a significant inverse relationship between serum cotinine and scores on reading (&#223; = -2.69, p = 0.001), math (&#223; = -1.93, p = 0.01), and block design (&#223; = -0.55, p &lt; 0.001) but not digit span (&#223; = -0.08, p = 0.52). The estimated ETS-associated decrement in cognitive test scores was greater at lower cotinine levels. A log-linear analysis was selected as the best fit to characterize the increased slope in cognitive deficits at lower levels of exposure. These data, which indicate an inverse association between ETS exposure and cognitive deficits among children even at extremely low levels of exposure, support policy to further restrict children's exposure. Key words: children, cognition, environment, environmental tobacco smoke, epidemiology. British Medical Association condemns tobacco industry ventilation claims EXCERPTS from: BMA condemns tobacco industry ventilation claims - News-Medical. Following a conference held this morning by the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, the BMA stressed that ventilation does not protect employees or customers from the deadly effects of passive smoke and condemned arguments otherwise as untrue and based on flawed science.</paragraph><paragraph parID="270">Research in America found that there was 50 times more air pollution in a smoky bar than in New York's Holland tunnel at rush hour, and studies have found that ventilation in bars does not reduce the risk to the health of customers or staff. The tobacco industry has proposed that ventilation is the solution to the problem of passive smoke, however, scientific evidence proves that conventional ventilation and air-cleaning systems do not provide effective protection against the health hazards of second hand smoke. Ventilation systems use a filtration method to re-circulate air. However, while this method can clear the smoky atmosphere, the toxins present in the gas of second hand smoke remains. Dr Peter Terry, Chairman of BMA Scotland said: "Passive smoke kills. Businesses installing expensive ventilation systems will do so in the belief that they are protecting staff and the public from the ill-effects of second hand smoke. "Although good ventilation can help reduce the irritability of smoke, it does not eliminate its poisonous components.</paragraph><paragraph parID="271">Tobacco smoke contains 4,000 toxins and more than 50  cancer-causing substances. "Partial bans on smoking in enclosed public places would not protect people from the harmful health effects of exposure to passive smoke, and voluntary measures have failed. Our only hope now is that our MSPs are not wavered by misleading claims fuelled by the tobacco industry. The only way to protect the significant majority of the population who do not smoke is to legislate for smoke free enclosed public places." Secondhand Smoke, or Environmental Tobacco Smoke [ETS], has been labeled a Class A carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ETS kills through:      Several types of cancers      Cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke)      Respiratory diseases      Perinatal death, miscarriage, low birth weight      Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) ETS increases the risk of illness including:      Atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries)      Respiratory infections -- pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, colds, sore throats      Asthma      Middle ear infections      Dental caries</paragraph><paragraph parID="272">The politicians in Ireland, Norway, and New York have decided to put the health of their citizens first by banning smoking in enclosed public places. In a stark BMA report, The Human Cost of Tobacco , published today (9 November 2004), doctors chronicle individual stories behind the statistics to show how second-hand smoke destroys lives and health. There is no doubt that giving up smoking can be extremely difficult - like any addiction kicking the habit is no easy task. A nonsmoker who suffered from asthma, Dr. Hanson was a passenger aboard an Olympic Airways international flight in 1998 and was seated near the smoking section. After he began suffering major breathing distress, Dr. Hanson and his wife made repeated requests of the flight crew to have him moved away from the smoke. The flight crew refused to move him. Dr. Hanson later died on that smoke-filled flight at the age of 52.</paragraph><paragraph parID="273">I hope that Dr. Hanson's tragic and unnecessary death will help destroy the myth that secondhand smoke has never killed anyone. I never smoked. However, for many of my 75 years I inhaled the carcinogens borne by second hand smoke in restaurants such as the Anchor Inn, in elevators, at meetings, on airplanes, in stores. Health experts say that's probably why I now have fourth-stage lung cancer that also has spread elsewhere in my body. Since Mr. Duncan vetoed the smoking ban in restaurants a few years ago, progressive states and local jurisdictions have enacted smoke free legislation such as the bill we passed then in Montgomery County. Those jurisdictions did not see patron flight from their restaurants. Instead, what they did see was a reduced number of health problems that were due to the inhalation of carcinogens that previously permeated their smoke-filled restaurants.</paragraph><paragraph parID="274">Ventilation does not work. Council members, Mr. Duncan and tobacco companies know this. I have given her examples and statistics of teenagers that start smoking at an early age and what can happen if they constantly smoke cigarettes. Parents need to set a good example for their kids so they will not start to smoke or try to smoke. I tell my friend to quit smoking so she can have a long and healthy life. The first steps to stop smoking is kind of difficult, but can be accomplished with help and support from people who have quit smoking and friends and family. Throwing away all cigarettes and ashtrays is a good beginning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="275">By getting a hair cut, getting your car cleaned, cleaning your house from top to bottom to get the smell of cigarette out of the house, getting all clothes cleaned, getting lots of exercise by drinking lots of fluids, cutting back on coffee servings and by keeping a candy or any type of food in your mouth to stop the temptation of grabbing a cigarette and smoking it is a good way to stop smoking (ALA). Smoking can be very harmful to a person's health. The smell of smoke can also bother a person who does not smoke. One of my friends has an annoying habit of always smoking around me, knowing that I hate the smell of cigarettes. Smoking not only causes cancer and other diseases to those who smoke, but to others around them. Smoking has not only been a problem for older people, but also for teenagers who smoke as well. Many of my friends smoke, which does not bother me, but it bothers me when they smoke around me.</paragraph><paragraph parID="276">I have a friend in particular that constantly smokes around me, knowing that I'm pregnant and that I hate it. I have expressed my feelings to her about smoking and what it can do to her health and others around her. There are many reasons why smoking is bad for her and those around her. First of all it causes deadly diseases and cancers not only to smokers, but to second-hand smokers as well. Smoking also causes the smoker's clothes and others around him/her to be penetrated by the smell of cigarette. It also causes harm to children who live in a household with smokers and are candidates to become smokers at a young age. It also causes a non-smokers dinner or meal to be disturbed by another person smoking around them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="277">One last reason why smoking is bad is because smoking causes a second hand smoker to become ill by having headaches, eye irritations, nausea and dizziness (ACSH). Some of the cancers that can be detected in a smoker is lung, mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, kidney and pancreas cancer. Some of the diseases are emphysema, asthma, heart diseases, and respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ALA). She is at a higher risk of a heart attack and have two to four times the chance of having a cardiac arrest (ACSH). These cancers and deadly diseases are not only found in smokers, but in second hand smokers as well (ACSH). Smoking is also a danger to a woman who is expecting a baby and breast feeding, whether she smokes or not. The nicotine from the cigarettes is found in breast milk, which affects the baby because that is where the baby gets its nutrients.</paragraph><paragraph parID="278">The nicotine freely crosses the placenta and is found in the amniotic fluid and the umbilical cord of newborns, which causes the baby to be underweight and have respiratory problems. When my friend and I go to a restaurant, we always argue whether to sit either in the smoking section or in the non-smoking section. When we sit in a smoking section our clothes get penetrated with the smell of smoke. I tell my friend that the smell of smoke does not fade away with perfume or cologne. The smell stays on the clothes until it has been washed. When she smokes in front of me, I get headaches and feel nauseous because of the scent on my clothes and her blowing smoke in my face. Children who have grown up around cigarettes and smoking of any kind are likely to end up smoking at a young age.</paragraph><paragraph parID="279">These children are likely to grow up with ear infections, bronchitis and other respiratory diseases (ACSH). More than 3,000 kids a year become addicted and become regular smokers and more than one third of these kids will die of smoking (ACSH). I tell my friend that many of the diseases and cancers can develop quicker in a person who starts smoking at an early age. Cigarettes can be addictive to teenagers because nicotine produces pleasurable feelings that make the smoker want to smoke more and it also acts as a depressant (ACSH). This is my friends excuse for smoking all the time, She says it relaxes her and calms her down when she is worried or depressed. The reason she started smoking was because her parents would always smoke in front of her. Quitting is not always an easy task.</paragraph><paragraph parID="280">It takes a lot of dedication and effort. There are many benefits to quit smoking. First of all the body begins a series of change. A persons blood pressure decreases, pulse rates drops, body temperature of hands and feet increases, chance of a heart attack decreases, ability to smell and taste is enhanced, walking becomes easier, lung function increases, risk of coronary heart disease is decreased to half that of a smoker and the risk of any kind of cancer is decreased (ALA). The next steps come from an article on the web. Smoking is an annoying habit by my friend that is less tolerated by society. Repeated smoking can cause her to develop deadly cancers and diseases.</paragraph><paragraph parID="281">This does not only affect my friend, but her family and friends as well. As I have told my friend smoking is a bad habit and can be dropped rather quickly. Of course it is not easy, but having patience and encouragement from her family and friends is the key to quitting. It will not only improve her life, but others around her. A comprehensive ban would have the largest impact on youth and young adult smoking. The fact that adolescents smoke the most highly advertised brands indicates that they are responsive to these marketing campaigns. The tobacco industry's advertising and promotional products are filled with messages and images that reflect the qualities teenagers value, such as popularity, independence, sexiness and 'coolness'.</paragraph><paragraph parID="282">The likelihood of smoking is increased when an adolescent acquires a cigarette promotional item and decreases if the item is lost. The most recent studies clearly conclude that partial advertising bans have little impact on overall cigarette smoking given that the industry can simply shift expenditures on advertising in the banned media to other advertising and promotional activities. Comprehensive bans on advertising and promotion, however, are found to significantly reduce the overall smoking. There is clear evidence that children's attention is attracted by cigarette advertising and that they remember it. Head off teenage smoking by talking about smoking when your children are young-and continue to discuss it through high school. Bring up not only the health problems caused by smoking, but also the bad breath, wrinkled skin, and yellowed teeth. The most important thing is to keep the lines of communication open -- the more you talk to your children, the better chance you have of staying close when things get tough or when important issues like smoking arise.</paragraph><paragraph parID="283">Smoking greatly increases the chances of heart disease and stroke. Smoking during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage , low birth weight, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Cool Teenagers Use Peer Pressure to Prevent Smoking The University of Bristol has its hands on a new anti-smoking weapon--teenage social influencers. Getting teenagers to stop smoking is one of the toughest quests out there for doctors and public health professionals, but today the University of Bristol announced that it has its hands on a new approach--using teenagers as messengers--that it thinks will actually work. Having just concluded an extensive trial using influential teenagers to help prevent the uptake of smoking among their peers by conveying particular messages in social situations, the University is ready to roll out a nationwide preventative initiative across the U.K. The influential teenagers in the initial trial had the responsibility of making it uncool for their peers to begin smoking in the first place and results indicate that such an approach could help prevent 40,000 more teens from taking up the habit.</paragraph><paragraph parID="284">While institutions like the CDC, WHO, and numerous research institutions at top Universities are busy using largely government-sponsored media campaigns, it turns out that it may be more effective to rely on the good ol' traditional in-person tactic. So in the Bristol approach, a preventative--rather than treatment-based--approach, relying heavily on direct communication and social influence, is key. "Our research has shown that teenagers respond far better to anti-smoking messages from their peers than they do from the Government, the NHS, their teachers or even their parents," said Professor Rona Campbell in the University of Bristol press release . It will be interesting to watch how quickly those same "influential" teenagers turn un-cool because of their anti-smoking behavior and language or if they're suave enough to casually slip in a sentence or two here or there. teenagers think if they smoke more girls will fall in line. Also, smoking while pregnant highly increases a lot more pregnancy complications, premature birth, and giving birth to a stillborn baby to name but a few. Therefore, following the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, in which American tobacco companies agreed to stop directly targeting pre-teens and teens with tobacco advertisements, the Big Tobacco companies have had to become more nimble and more creative in their efforts to addict a new generation of pre-teens, teens, and young adults to their deadly products, while simultaneously circumventing the restrictions imposed upon them by the Master Settlement Agreement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="285">In the United States, the incidence of smoking continues to slowly decrease (although, sadly, mostly among the male half of the population) as a consequence of increased public education efforts, as well as increasingly restrictive laws against tobacco advertising and public smoking. In 2007, Camel No. 9 cigarettes joined the stable of prior and current cigarettes designed and marketed to appeal specifically to females, including the notorious Virginia Slims brand (produced and marketed by Phillip Morris), as well as the Capri and Misty brands. While the Camel cigarette brand had previously been targeted at male smokers, Camel No. 9 was rolled out, 3 years ago, by R. J. Reynolds, with launch parties targeted specifically at women, at nightclubs and bars around the country. The fifth and final interview was conducted after R.J. Reynolds' roll-out of their 2007 campaign on behalf of the new Camel No. 9 brand of cigarettes. Among the boys participating in this study, the percentage of teenagers who identified any favorite cigarette advertisements remained stable throughout the 5 sequential interviews, including the fifth interview in 2008 (after Camel No. 9 was introduced by R.J. Reynolds). Teenagers occupy a strange netherworld between childhood and adulthood. A 2009 survey, 'The Voice of Young People', found that, for teens who smoked, fitting in and 'being cool' was a far more important concern than the adverse health consequences of smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="286">Irish parents remain very reluctant to talk about sex with their teens.

No danger for stroke or heart attack... You need to deal with all the aspects that emerge once you've stopped smoking. Emotions When you stop, all the feelings that were repressed through the smoking will surface. From my experience it is smarter to create some space to deal with the feelings and release the suppressed issues. Psychokinesiology is a great technique to come quickly to the point.

Support In my experience you need a lot of support to go through this process, and the Tourist Program as well as the wellness weeks are excellent processes to guide you through the difficult moments. You can get my support with individual sessions in counselling, psychokinesiology, ear acupuncture, Mental Field Therapy, and orthomolecular supplementation when you come here. If your problem has an emotional, habitual or perhaps psychological origin, then hypnotherapy is an excellent way to communicate with these parts of the mind. Hypnosis is a different state of consciousness to the normal alert state and you can easily enter it so that, for therapeutic purposes, beneficial instructions may be given directly to your receptive unconscious mind. Thus, hypnosis is an effective way of making contact with our inner (unconscious) self, which is both a reservoir of unrecognised potential and knowledge as well as being the unwitting source of many of our habits and limitations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="290">No-one can be hypnotised against their will and even when hypnotised, a person can still reject any suggestions offered to them or return to normal alert consciousness at will. Hypnotherapy is actually a state of purposeful co-operation between the therapist and the client, to obtain a specific result, agreed upon beforehand. Hypnotherapy is used successfully to benefit the following: &#8226; sporting performance &#8226; weight control &#8226; performance anxiety &#8226; self-confidence &#8226; phobias &#8226; exam nerves &#8226; anxiety and panic &#8226; improve learning &#8226; memory and concentration &#8226; stress reduction &#8226; eating disorders &#8226; compulsive behaviour &#8226; pain control &#8226; blood pressure &#8226; self-image problems &#8226; stopping smoking &#8226; skin problems &#8226; Irritable Bowel Syndrome The main criterion is that the cause of the presenting problem lies within the unconscious mind, often due to a 'seeding' event or to unintentional behavioural conditioning in formative years. It's interesting to note that the unconscious mind always acts in such a way that it attempts to protect and preserve the individual and many fears and phobias have at their root a form of exaggerated self-preservation. Eventually he decided to try hypnosis after seeing it work successfully for a phobia sufferer on a BBC television programme.</paragraph><paragraph parID="291">Quite interestingly the casual event turned out to be an accident in his childhood, when he was playing on a garden shed roof with his older brother. The Lincolnshire Police have recently come up with an innovative way to involve disruptive Teens. This is a great project and I can really see how they can learn so much especially adapting their body language, self awareness and managing emotions especially in such confined spaces. Hypnosis employs a naturally occurring state of mind and it may surprise you to learn that we experience trance states often during our lives, in fact several times a day. Just drifting into ordinary sleep involves a kind of trance state, typically one where the mind is becoming free of verbal thinking (left brain) and entering a more visual state (right brain), similar to that of dream sleep. The experience of hypnosis is in many ways is similar to the sleepy hypnogogic state, being neither asleep nor awake and prone to imagery and association with a pleasant feeling of calmness and relaxation underpinning it all. The hypnotic state occurs normally in everyone when certain physiological and psychological conditions are met and it is possible to use this state to make deep and long lasting changes to thoughts, feelings and behaviour.</paragraph><paragraph parID="292">In hypnosis, the tendency is for these suggestions to be accepted far more than in the normal state and we may 'seed' constructive ideas which then change behaviour and attitudes at their source. Parents need to set boundaries and agree them with your teen in advance because it makes life a whole lot more agreeable. What can you do if your child has started smoking? Talking to teenagers about smoking can be tricky. Read these tips if your child is smoking and you want to try to help them quit. If you smoke yourself, give up. It will help if you can set a good example.</paragraph><paragraph parID="293">Don't panic or overreact. If you are very worried you may want to talk to another adult before talking to your child. Choose a time to talk to your child when you're calm and they don't want to be somewhere else. Ask lots of open questions to find out how they started smoking, how often they smoke, who they smoke with etc. Be aware that starting conversations with 'why' can seem aggressive. Make sure you really listen to what your child is saying. Explain that its better never to start smoking as it quickly leads to addiction .</paragraph><paragraph parID="294">Point out how expensive smoking is and discuss what else your child could do with the money. You can try discussing the health effects of smoking. But young people will often have learnt about the consequences of smoking at school and may not want to think about their long-term health. Keep talking about smoking from time to time in a non-confrontational manner . At the same time make it clear that you do have your own views and house rules. Offer your love and support. Focus on the positives and try to build your child's self esteem.</paragraph><paragraph parID="295">Acknowledge any progress they make with giving up. Giving up isn't easy for adults or children. Be aware of the difficulties your child may be facing and the isolation they may feel if all their friends are smoking. Shockingly, smoking is the major cause of cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, emphysema, and also premature ageing. However, campaigns against smoking have largely been carried out so as to create awareness to the public on the effects of smoking and nowadays the number of teen smokers has been in the decline. However, antismoking campaigns have been spending large amount of money in crating awareness on the effects of smoking in our livelihoods. On the other hand, the number of teen smokers has been declining for various reasons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="296">The social reasons include awareness on the effects of smoking in schools and public advertisements through media. Economical reason is as a result of increase in the prices of tobacco which is caused by either the increase in cigarette production or high tax levied on the cigarettes. In the recent years, social campaigns have been in the run in sensitizing teenagers on the effects of smoking and methods which can be used by an addicted individual so as to stop the habit. These campaigns also informed the public on the incurable diseases caused by smoking such as cancer which can only be prevented once an individual stops the habit. This made many teenagers to stop the habit early enough before addiction. Additionally, teens are advised to join pro-social groups or clubs which promote healthy living styles. This is done so as to reduce the likelihood of that the teen to restart the habit (Urberg,p.245).</paragraph><paragraph parID="297">Schools have also not been left behind in the antismoking programs. Teenage smokers are provided with rehabilitation resources which help in making them stop the habit. In addition, many schools have guidance and counseling personnel who deal with smoking and other substance abuse issues. Subjects related to smoking and their effects in the livelihood have also been introduced. However, school environments are most conducive for the antismoking campaigns since many teenagers get informed and they continue to inform amongst themselves. At the family level, parents are required by antismoking campaigners to talk to their teenagers on the smoking habits among other substances abuse. This is considered to be the most successive campaigns if only parents cooperated with the move.</paragraph><paragraph parID="298">As a result many teenagers have stopped smoking form talking with their parents and family members. More also, this move have rendered many adults to stop smoking in a trial to set a good pace to their children (Johannes,p.12). Furthermore, antismoking campaigns have campaigned against advertisement of tobacco products in the social media such as dailies, televisions or the internet. Government and academic bodies have helped in the implementation of efforts to fight the use of tobacco by imposing ban on the advertisements. However, with little awareness of the tobacco products on the ground, the move has greatly helped in reducing the number of smokers hence it is considered one area of success by antismoking campaigns. In addition, government has contributed towards the decline in the number of smokers by imposing economic measures on the tobacco products. However, this has been implemented by increasing tax rate levied on the products.</paragraph><paragraph parID="299">Therefore, prices of tobacco products have increased in the market. This has resulted to some individuals stopping the habit due to economic disadvantages. Most teenagers are dependent on their parents hence it is hard for them to afford the products (Francis,p.32). Another reason which has contributed to the decline is the loosing of lawsuit by tobacco companies. Instead they were made to pay for the anti-smoking advertisements. The added cost has to be recovered by the high prices of tobacco products. This has made young people not to afford the products.</paragraph><paragraph parID="300">On the other hand, anti-smoking advertisements create awareness to the public on the truth of the effects of nicotine which has led to the pull out of many teenagers from the smoking habit (West,p.23). Rehabilitated teenage smokers have also been campaigning through the media on how unhealthy and un-cool smoking is. This is influential and helpful in changing the minds of the decided potential teenage smokers. With the understanding of teenagers being influential, the move to use other teenagers to campaign against the habit has highly boosted the successful results of anti-smoking campaigns. This is because teenagers have shallow knowledge about live ahead of that and trying smoking is part of making fun in their lives. Therefore, it is easy to control smoking habit among the teenagers by sensitizing them on the harmful effects of the habit to their lives. Family level can be the best rehabilitation and containment environment to smokers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="301">This is because members of the family have a good understanding on the behaviors of a person hence they identify behavioral change in a person earlier than teachers and other members of the society. More also, government and other bodies need to identify hopeless teenagers and work on improving their lives by reducing their stigma. This can be done by providing them with education facilities and rehabilitation early enough before they get into the smoking habit. In addition, smoking is a contentious issue which would require to be taken by every individual by advising and reporting teenagers who are seen practicing the habit. Wow, teenagers are not allowed. Smoking tobacco in any form is harmful to the smokers as well as the people around them, therefore it should be banned in all public places. The main reason to ban smoking is to make it more and more difficult for people to keep up this terrible habit or to get used to it in the first place.</paragraph><paragraph parID="302">Dubai: People under 20 will not be allowed to frequent shisha cafes, part of the emirate's third phase of anti-smoking regulations, which rolls out on November 18. This marks the third phase of Dubai's new smoking regulations, following government offices becoming smoke-free on May 30 and shopping malls on September 16. Salem Mesmar, director of public health at Dubai Municipality, told Gulf News that the age limit was to curb teenage smoking and protect the health of the public. "Nobody under 20 can be served in shisha places. No children will be allowed at shisha cafes," he said. The UAE should ban selling shisha to teenagers. Shisha should be banned totally in cafes and in the market.</paragraph><paragraph parID="303">Prohibiting smoking in restaurants is a positive step. And will these pictures really convince a jaded smoker to quit or prevent a rebellious teenager from starting? The 2009 Family Smoking Prevention Tobacco Control Act , which gave FDA the authority to regulate tobacco, mandated that the agency issue requirements for cigarette labels large enough to make up 50% of the front and rear panels of the package, with specific wording of risk warnings, including "color graphics depicting the negative health consequences of smoking." What exactly those graphics would be was up to FDA. So in 2010, the agency devised 36 images depicting different health consequences and held an 18,000 participant survey to determine the nine winners. The study looked at factors such as how well people could recall a certain image days later, or what kind of emotional response a subject had. What the study didn't address: whether or not people actually quit as a result of seeing the images.</paragraph><paragraph parID="304">FDA spokesperson Jeffrey Ventura says that isn't the point. The study, he says, is just one data point in a larger body of literature that finds warning labels effective. Gruesome warning labels aren't new; over 40 nations already require them. In countries like the United Kingdom and Canada, however, it's impossible to say whether the imagery itself contributed to a decline in smoking or other influences caused smoking to fall out of vogue. Ventura adds that this analysis wasn't needed for the FDA decision. "This was a requirement under the law. This wasn't up for FDA to interpret or a choice to do or not to."</paragraph><paragraph parID="305">Still, he says the labels fit in with FDA's larger mission of raising awareness of smoking risks; currently they are only in text. "These warnings haven't been updated since 1985, and anecdotal logic says that these warnings have become white noise," Ventura says. "The new generation of youth at risk are a very visually stimulated group of folks." Behavioral psychologist Carol Tavris, author of the recent book Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me), doubts that teenagers will be scared by images of bad things happening to older strangers. "Has anyone been to the movies lately? [HBO's] Game of Thrones , where people's heads are cut off in front of you? I think people's tolerance for the ugly and the violent is quite high. "</paragraph><paragraph parID="306">But the FDA wasn't aiming for scary imagery, says Ventura. "The images in other countries are extremely graphic, but I think these images weren't necessarily chosen for shock and awe." For instance, the woman holding a baby illustrates the dangers of secondhand smoke, while the man smoking through a tracheotomy hole in his neck illustrates the power of addiction. Science Insider asked Tavris what the current research in behavioral psychology has to say about the effectiveness of fear imagery. " 'Current' research?" she replied in an e-mail. "Social psychologists have decades of research showing that fear communications generally backfire, that people tune them out, and therefore that these tactics are generally not effective."</paragraph><paragraph parID="307">Tavris cites the Department of Homeland Security's post-9-11 terror alert system as an example of warning that became a joke to many Americans. While the system certainly raised awareness, it didn't couple that awareness with any action a person could take to protect himself. "To be effective, the fear message must be combined with an immediate action the person can do to alleviate the fear," she says. "So what are people going to do with these new feelings of anxiety and fear? To calm yourself, you think, 'What a stupid code.' " The new FDA labels do suggest an action: stop smoking. But as any smoker can attest, this is far more easily said than done.</paragraph><paragraph parID="308">Counterintuitively, Tavris says, smokers who want to quit but have failed are actually the group who are most likely to make a joke out of the new labels. The behavioral phenomenon at play is called cognitive dissonance: a clash between two conflicting beliefs. One way to resolve the tension is to override the disturbing new message. "Dissonance is a pretty powerful phenomenon," says Tavris. It explains "why people continue to do things they know are harmful, but still see themselves as smart." And the people most likely to do this, she says, are the ones who have tried to quit and failed. Common sources of teenage stress might be choices regarding dress, smoking, drinking, sex, going out, career choices, etc.</paragraph><paragraph parID="309">They both reported that teenagers most exposed to films in which characters smoked were 73% more likely to have tried a cigarette. Each year we have nearly 800,000 smokers who try to quit, 50% succeed. Coinciding with the enforcement of the smoke-free environments amendment act, University of Otago researchers continue to produce definitive evidence of the dangers of second-hand smoke and are helping to stub out smoking and nicotine addition. Dr Sarah Hill whose research has led to the world's largest and most precise study on passive smoking and mortality. Photo: David Mills The big questions about smoking have been answered and the answers are as ugly as they are unequivocal. Cigarettes make you sick and, given enough time, will kill you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="310">So far, so depressing. However, there's plenty that, until now, has not been properly understood, particularly about the quantifiable risks of second-hand smoke and the most effective ways to lead smokers out of the lethal haze of nicotine addiction. That this is starting to clear is in no small part due to the work of a motivated group of Otago health researchers spread across three campuses whose findings could have a big influence on tobacco control policies. This is not science in a vacuum. On their office walls you will find anti-smoking messages. Their findings have helped shape the just-released Ministry of Health fiveyear tobacco-control plan. They have identified the enemy and are helping to stub it out.</paragraph><paragraph parID="311">Eight of the researchers profiled their work at last year's Smoke-free Conference in Wellington which, as usual, took as its gloomy starting point the fact smoking kills 4,700 New Zealanders a year, making it this country's second leading cause of preventable death after diet. We are not alone in this; both Britain (120,000 deaths) and Australia (18,000) list smoking as their major preventable killer. Hidden behind these heavy-duty statistics are the mortality rates of passive, or second-hand, smoking, which have always been harder to quantify. But an ingenious research insight by Dr Sarah Hill, of the Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences, has changed that, leading to the world's largest and most precise study on passive smoking and mortality. Her breakthrough came when she realised New Zealand Census-Mortality Study (NZCMS) data could be used to place people in either smoke-free households or households in which at least one other adult was a current smoker. After identifying the New Zealand adult "never-smokers" aged 45-74 who responded to the 1981 and 1996 censuses, Hill's study then compared death rates of never-smokers in the smoke-free households versus other households. The result?</paragraph><paragraph parID="312">Proof of a 15 per cent higher mortality than neversmokers who lived in a smoke-free household. Hill is in Africa and couldn't be contacted for this article, but her supervisor Associate Professor Tony Blakely (principal investigator of the NZCMS) has little doubt about the importance of her work. "If you average across all the previous studies it looks like there may be about a 15 per cent excess risk [for non-smokers living with smokers]. Then you put out a study which is the largest in the world and it comes in very tightly on that 15 per cent. It really firms up the evidence base. We think it's a pretty important study." Making the breakthrough even more satisfying was its timing, allowing it to be released simultaneously with the Health Sponsorship Council's "Take It Outside" advertising campaign targeting smoking in the home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="313">"It's a classic example of great research coming out of a study that we didn't quite click to at the beginning, but also great research managing to come out at the same time as advocacy work, which was very rewarding. That doesn't happen very often." "It's very much a matter of trying to change general understanding about second-hand smoke. It's not just annoying; it's as dangerous as if you were spraying chemical sprays in your home. There's an abstract realisation that it's dangerous, but the degree of harm is poorly understood." Dr George Thomson Photo: Bill Nichol</paragraph><paragraph parID="314">The work fits well with that being done by Drs Nick Wilson and George Thomson, also from the Wellington campus. By reviewing existing studies here and overseas they have underlined harm from second-hand smoke, but also some effective tobacco control measures. This has been timely, considering the provisions of the Smoke-free Environments Amendment Act which came into force on December 10 banning smoking in workplaces, including bars. "There've been studies that are showing even a small number of cigarettes actively smoked per day give an increased risk of heart disease and that sort of level is equating with some of the heavier exposure that some workers are getting in smoky bars. When you look at it all these different ways, the evidence builds up to a very convincing level," Wilson says. The bad news keeps coming, with a link between secondhand smoke and meningococcal disease risk of particular concern considering the New Zealand epidemic. "It seems that irritant-type exposure makes it easier for the bug that is sitting in the back of many people's throats to penetrate their system and cause the meningococcal infection."</paragraph><paragraph parID="315">But where to from here? Surely the home is the final frontier and nobody is seriously suggesting the smoking police will be knocking on people's doors? Well, maybe they won't need to. Thomson, whose research is into the best investments in tobacco control, says that after reviewing overseas and New Zealand studies he is convinced well-directed, well-funded anti-smoking campaigns do work. New Zealand's adult smoking rate sits at about 25 per cent, but he believes only about five per cent of those smokers are an intractable hard core - the rest are waiting to be persuaded away from the fags. Associate Professor Tony Blakely: ". . . we're starting to get very firm evidence about where it (smoking) is contributing to the differences in society." "Other countries, states and provinces have shown you can make really rapid decreases of smoking prevalence with really active programmes if you have combinations of smokefree environments, taxation, cessation programmes, media campaigns and other things."</paragraph><paragraph parID="316">Part of the aim is bridging the disconnection between what people know they should be doing and what they are doing. An unpublished New Zealand survey shows more than 80 per cent of smokers think that others have a right to a smoke-free home, yet more than 55 per cent of teenagers with smoking parents said smoking did happen in their homes. Thomson believes New Zealand is moving in the right direction with initiatives such as Quitline - which reported in July 2004 it had helped 23,000 smokers quit - the smokefree workplaces legislation and last year's "Take It Outside" campaign. However, he says the country needs to increase the money put into tobacco control programmes from $30 million to $75- $80 million, which would bring the funding into line with US Centre for Disease Control guidelines for a population our size. "There's a funding gap, and still a major legislative gap with things like retail display of tobacco. And taxation - we need a significant annual rise." Direct intervention in homes might be beyond the reach of lawmakers, but don't rule out smoke-free cars, he says, especially when children are passengers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="317">His research is moving on to the impact of the smoke-free workplace legislation and will study the media coverage of its impact. Blakely's work is now focusing on the role of smoking in social differences, such as the very high ethnic inequalities in health in New Zealand. "We found out smoking causes lung cancer 50-odd years ago. We're not in that league, but we're starting to get very firm evidence about where it is contributing to the differences in society." The big question - why does anybody do it at all? - he finds slightly easier to answer. In fact, it's the root of the whole dirty business.</paragraph><paragraph parID="318">"It's addictive, mate." The answer is simple: that's what usually happens, so I reckoned it was well worth the small risk of looking like an idiot myself for the great opportunity to demonstrate to thousands of smokers that hypnotherapy is by far the easiest and most successful way of quitting smoking, and anyone can do it. That's why the recent government decision to raise the legal age for purchasing tobacco to eighteen is so stupid, because all it does is extend the period of time for which teenagers will be tempted to do that by two years! The urge to pick up tobacco is not really a need or a desire, it just feels like that! It is an impulse sent by the brain, but routed through the body, so you feel it as a physical 'pang' - very much like a hunger pang, also produced by the same system. These pangs will continue, and typically continue to become more insistent until you do respond. In hypnotherapy, the therapist explains to the Subconscious mind that the smoking behaviour is under review - and the reasons - and then asks for the signals to be shut down, along with the whole habitual smoking routine.</paragraph><paragraph parID="319">It is very easy indeed for the Subconscious mind to do that, because what we are really asking it to do from that point onwards is nothing, instead of directing the daily repetition of a smoking habit. A Return to Normal So the impulse to buy, smoke or accept tobacco that is offered (or cannabis, this will work for any smoking habit) disappears, and the client is returned to normal. It does not matter how much smoking was going on previously, or for how long. The only thing that matters is how the client feels about being rid of the problem. Mixed Feelings? It is quite normal for clients to have mixed feelings about stopping smoking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="320">It is part of my job to help them make sense of all that, and get rid of any conflicts there might be about quitting. Then there are the ideas and beliefs that support the habit: Lots of smokers assume that smoking helps them deal with stress. In reality it causes tiredness and hypertension (high blood pressure). A Simple Misunderstanding So why does the Subconscious mind respond to stress by sending an impulse to light up? The Pleasure Issue</paragraph><paragraph parID="321">Long before any of us smoked, we were all bombarded with millions of suggestions that smoking is a pleasure, yet most smokers remember that their first encounters with tobacco were nauseating.So whatever it was that made us pick up the second cigarette, it certainly wasn't because we enjoyed the first one.And if there is a pleasure in smoking, how come we didn't notice it straight away, eh?The average habit costs about &#163;1800 a year - most of it tax - and if someone asked you to describe the pleasure of smoking, could you find anything to say?Hypnotherapy is the most effective method of the various ways of quitting tobacco available to smokers, according to the largest ever scientific study of the subject, carried out by the University of Iowa in 1992.</paragraph></documents>
