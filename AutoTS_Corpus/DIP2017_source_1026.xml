  <paragraph parID="0">She explained that her assignment was to listen to at least five minutes of classical music and her teacher had suggested the kids find something on YouTube. The idea of her browsing around YouTube on her own was out of the question. So we found something together-Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik. These days every parent has to teach his or her child how to navigate our very connected world. According to a recent survey by Intel, kids on average start using desktop computers at age 5&#189; and a laptop at 7&#189;. So when do parents need to have the tech equivalent of the birds and the bees talk with their children? I consulted child psychologist Dr. Scott A. Roth to find out.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">Dr. Roth suggests having the first conversation in kindergarten. One of the biggest concerns should be if and how the site offers your child the ability to interact with others. The key at this age, says Dr. Roth, is to be in control of what your child can encounter. NetNanny for Mac So how do you set up safeguards for your kids? You can begin by creating a separate account on your computer for your child and setting up the parental controls that are built into the Windows and Max OS X operating systems. They cover which programs can be used, the time of day the computer can be used and the content or age ratings for games.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">If you let your child access the Internet, you'll want to add a program that can filter web content and generate activity reports, like Bsecure Online ($49.95 at bsecure.com ), NetNanny ($39.99 at netnanny.com ) or Norton Online Family Premier($29.99 per year at norton.com ). According to Dr. Roth, the next phase starts around 8 or 9 years old, when kids are more socially in tune with what other kids are doing. He says that it's important to talk about what's appropriate in a text message or online, and to communicate the risks; once words are out there, it's hard to take them back. Dr. Roth counsels his patients that if they can't look someone in the eyes and say it, not to say it. Not bad advice at any age. Then as kids begin puberty and start developing relationships with the opposite sex, you need to set new ground rules. The technology available today takes away the natural anxiety of approaching someone you're interested in asking out.</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">Plus kids don't necessarily understand the potential risks of their actions. A middle-school-age girl may not grasp that the inappropriate picture she sent of herself to her boyfriend would be forwarded to his friends and friends of his friends. It's important to not only set limits and enforce them, but explain your reasoning. At this point, parents should consider reading their kid's email and social networking pages. It does intrude on the child's privacy, but digital messages are out there-somewhat in the public domain. If you can read them, so can a lot of other people. Monitoring your child's communications can also clue you in to cyberbullying.</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">Cyberbullying is most common in middle school, but can happen earlier. Dr. Roth explains that the fear and isolation is the same as with regular bullying, but in cases of cyberbullying it follows the child home, which can cause them to feel there's no safe haven. Finally around 16 or 17, you need to let go. Let them know you trust them to be appropriate without your supervision. Your conversations don't have to stop, but reading their Facebook page and other monitoring should. Subscribe to the Techlicious Daily Email!

This is something we have all had to deal with and handle. Part of growing up. When we were little the "BULLIES" met us on the playground, in the bathroom, or on the dreaded BUS!</paragraph><paragraph parID="6">There were just a few of these kids roaming the halls, everyone knew who they were and to if possible steer clear. Often, the teachers knew who they were as well, and were able to intervene on occasion. We were able to escape the whole ordeal when we went home, or had a weekend. This gave us time to regroup, heal, and live to fight another day. Flash forward to 2012...the World has changed. In fact, we have a NEW WORLD to explore called the Internet. Like any new undiscovered World, the Internet is full of wonder and excitement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">It is also full of danger. Our children are the first generation of children that have grown up in this NEW Digital World! As many of you already know, they are embracing it and often know more about it by age 6 then we will ever know. They speak the language, know the customs, traditions, and are very comfortable using technology. Their brains are literally wired differently than ours, like any culture we are dealing with a generational gap. Our children are growing up fundamentally differently then we did. This causes some difficult issues to arise that our children are dealing with and we don't have a reference point from which to help them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="8">Case in point..."BULLIES" today. When I say CYBER BULLY what comes to mind? Chances are it is a little tougher to conjure up an image. Many parent's are at a loss, because we have never had to deal with a CYBER BULLY when we were growing up. BULLYING has changed in 2012, because our children are so connected via technology (the average teen spends 1 out of every 4 waking hours Online) they can literally be BULLIED 24/7. As if that weren't bad enough, the instances of BULLYING have gone through the roof. 160,000 students miss school everyday because of BULLYING.</paragraph><paragraph parID="9">6 out of 10 children say they have been CYBER BULLIED, yet only 4 out of 10 tell a parent. I don't know about you, but this sounds like our schools have become a WAR zone. CYBER BULLIES are using psychological torture and many are too immature to know how damaging that can be to a young person. This issue is going to continue to get worse, until we as parents get engaged and act now! We know we need to have the sex talk, and the drug and alcohol talk, but we need to be having the tech talk. Knowing what is going on in our child's digital world is something every parent needs to know. With 6 out of every 10 children being cyber bullied, chances are your child is being hurt by this and you may not even know about it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="10">Now that you know the difference, talk to your children early and often. Make sure you have the user name and passwords to all social networking sites they are using. Let them know you are going to have their back, even in this New Digital World. That there are dangers that they need to be aware of and you will confront those dangers together. If you would like access to a FREE tool that I use that gives me a window into the digital world of my two boys go to go.abeanstalk.com/Hannah The Kids Are Online: How to Keep Them Safe On Monday my nine-year-old daughter asked if she could borrow my iPad to do her music homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">Many kids are exposed to computers in schools at that age and they're fully capable of browsing to their favorite sites. Social networking has become a hobby for even the youngest of children. Websites such as Facebook have quickly become the go to option for kids when they are bored or when they want to catch up with what is going on with their friends. The Kids Safety @ Facebook survey conducted by Minor Monitor found that 38% of all kids on Facebook are under the age of 13 despite the guidelines suggested for use by the website. It also found that 30% of children use Facebook for 2 hours or more each day. For this reasons, it is essential that parents are always thinking of safety first when allowing their kids to use the internet and social networking sites such as Facebook. What are the Dangers Associated with Facebook?</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">Studies have shown that parents are no strangers to the dangers that exist on websites such as Facebook. In fact, an alarming 74% of parents whose kids use Facebook admit to being concerned about their child's safety. Why, then, are so many parents reluctant to take precautionary measures against the many dangers? The answer is the vast majority of parents know the dangers but feel like their child is responsible enough to let them know when a difficult situation arises. Another answer is that parents often feel that "friending" their children will magically help the dangers disappear. Unfortunately, "friending" only scratches the surface of the parental control needed for children when they use the website. Listed below are a few of the most prevalent dangers that children face when they use Facebook.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">Sexual predators Sharing too much information Giving informational access to strangers Cyber bullying Exposure to pornography Risk of identity theft Internet addiction</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">Hate crimes Learning about drugs and alcohol The dangers listed above are real and happen every single day on Facebook. Children are often coerced into things that they would not necessarily take part in if faced with it in the real world. The online environment makes it seem surreal and easier to take part in. To avoid the many dangers associated with Facebook, parents must teach and utilize Facebook safety for kids. Teaching Kids Facebook Safety</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">Regardless of the guidelines set forth by the website, children find ways to gain access to the website with or without their parent's permission. Parents must be sure that safety issues are addressed and that children are putting forth effort as well. The following is a guide for parents when teaching kids Facebook safety. Login/password information. Keeping the login/password information from parents should never be an option. Parents should have unlimited access. Children should be taught to never give out login/password information to people who may ask for it online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">Similarly, they should be instructed to never give out personal information such as phone numbers, addresses, and birthdays either. Making the profile "private. " A parent should always check the settings on their child's Facebook profile. A private profile can't be viewed by people unless they are friends with the child. Setting the profile to public view will allow strangers unlimited access to the profile. Kids should be instructed to keep the profile settings private, and parents should check this setting often. Facebook has taken some precautionary measures to keep users safe.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">Parents should take advantage of these built-in safety features. Posting photos. Posting pictures on Facebook can give away information such as location. Online sexual predators will also use what kids think is a harmless photo to commit internet crimes. If a parent does allow his or her child to post photos on Facebook, kids should be instructed to post head shots only. Friending. This is perhaps one of the most important parts of being safe while using Facebook.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">Kids should not be allowed to accept friend requests from strangers. Instructing kids to "accept" people they know and "decline" people they don't will greatly reduce their chances of being exposed to the many dangers that Facebook can bring about. Information that is "posted" can be viewed by everyone. Some kids simply do not realize that the information they post on status updates or on the page can be viewed by people on their friends list. Many times they are simply unaware of the confounds of Facebook and how it works. To protect children who have access to the website, parents must do their best to explain the vastness of the website and the dangers that are presented by it. Turning off "chat."</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">Facebook has a chat feature that can also pose a problem. To protect children on Facebook, it is important that parents practice internet control and monitor the settings by keeping the "chat" feature turned off. If a child feels the constant need to be on Facebook, spends excessive time socializing with friends via the website, and gets angry when Facebook privileges are taken away, he or she may be addicted. It is the parents responsibility to use internet control to ensure that the website doesn't engulf their child in an effort to help prevent addiction. Taking Facebook Safety to the Next Level With a large portion of Facebook users being children, protecting them from the dangers must be taken to the next level. While talking to children about internet safety is recommended, there is another option available to help increase the level of security and make Facebook a safer place for children regardless of how old they are.</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">Parental control software designed specifically for parents who are concerned for their child's safety on Facebook can help. Parents must take safety to the next level by investing in software that will give them unlimited access to what their children are doing while on the website. Internet crimes do not discriminate with age. Parents should be encouraged to take initiative and discover new ways to protect their kids from the crimes. Facebook Safety for Kids March 14, 2012 Doing this will allow parents to better control who their kids are talking to while on the website.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">Limiting time spent on the website. Believe it or not, Facebook can be addicting. Kids should be aware of what Facebook addiction is and instructed on how to overcome it. Websites such as minormonitor.com have designed parental control software to aid parents in protecting children while using the website. With internet crimes on the rise and Facebook becoming one of the main sources, it is no longer enough just to talk to kids about the dangers and give them a few rules to follow. It is without a doubt the new wave of protection that has proven to be beneficial to parents in keeping their kids safe on Facebook. The information above can help parents protect their kids from the many dangers presented by Facebook.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">Sometimes the younger the potential victim, the easier the crime is to commit.

Training Modules: Introduction: Children are exposed to the Internet at an early age and grow up using the technology. But they often don&#65533;t understand the risks.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">This lesson maps out the strategy by which parents can stay one step ahead. First teach your children, and then train other parents to do the same. Online Dangers: Children are given Internet access&#65533;without a user&#65533;s manual. This lesson provides just that.

We can buy, sell, make friends and gain knowledge. Whilst we have to accept that a large percentage of Internet users DO want to access pornography, there is an equally large percentage of parents who DO NOT want their children viewing this material. Some may feel that nudity, when presented in a proper fashion, is acceptable, but there are images out there that portray every possible sex act imaginable, from straight intercourse to bestiality (sex with animals) and, most worrying, child pornography. Adult and child pornography, the latter of which is illegal, can be extremely graphic, violent and desensitising. An innocent keyword typed into a search engine or the misspelling of a Web site's name can lead children (and adults) into sites that are shocking and often difficult to leave (some sites automatically reopen themselves every time you try to leave. It's not uncommon that pornography sites name and describe their site as something innocuous to entice people onto the site under false pretences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="28">At the moment it's popular for them to "hide behind" MP3 sites. (I've ventured onto a few of them myself) Porn sites are not the only ones that use misleading content information to increase visitors. Other sites, such as hate groups, cults, and weapons related sites also use deceptive and aggressive strategies to entice people onto their sites. These sites can include bomb making formulas, web pages that glorify violence, and recruiting venues for groups that want to convince children to help further their causes. Paedophiles exploit the anonymity that the Internet provides and often reside in chat-rooms and other interactive areas frequented by children, where they look for unassuming kids with whom they can cultivate a relationship, giving false information as to their identity. If a chat-room friend say's that he's 14, how can your kids be sure that he's not 34?</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">They can't! These predators often send alarming requests and transmit graphic pictures and information. Email addresses can be gathered up by those who are looking to market their sites aggressively. There are two main ways that this is done. If your child uses sites which display email addresses, whether it be competitions, guestbooks, discussion forums, pen-friend sites, etc. you recieve an email announcing that you can take part in a competition. To enter the competition you must forward the mail to X amount of people, plus the sender.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">More often than not, this is a scam to collect email addresses. Be sure to check your child's mail regularly and explain that they must NEVER visit a site directly from an email without your consent. So how can I avoid this? Quite simply, it's impossible to completely control what your child might see on the Internet. Even when surfing with your child, you may well end up on an unsavoury site. I was helping my daughter and her friends look for Britney Spears on the web. We typed in the appropriate keywords on a search engine, received a list of sites and started to click.</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">One site we entered was NOT Britney Spears, but pornography! Luckily, it wasn't too hard-core, but it may well have been. And I then had the job of explaining the other kid's parent's, how they got to see pornography from my computer. That said, there are a few things you can do to make it less likely that your child will be viewing unwanted material. Explain to your children the potential online dangers and how to avoid them. Monitor the amount of time they spend online, in the same way you would monitor their television viewing. Make sure they spend time with their "real world" friends and have outdoor activities to enjoy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">Keep the computer in the living area, where you can monitor online activity. Don't allow your child to surf from the privacy of his/her bedroom. Password-protect your Internet access, and do not let your children have access without your permission. Ask your child to tell you if they should experience something that they don't feel comfortable with. Have a regular routine of checking the history files on your computer to see where everyone has been surfing. And make sure your family knows you're checking. Explain the dangers of using their real name when sending email to people they do not know, or when participating in chat- rooms or other interactive areas of websites.</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">Encourage them to use "fun" names instead. A report by the Annenberg Public Policy Center showed that children online are very likely to give out information to marketers over the Web, especially when enticed with a free gift. Explain that people they meet online are not always who they say they are. Encourage your children to tell you about their online friends. Try to get to know them yourselves, just the way you would with their "real world" friends. Install filtering software, such at Net Nanny , Cyber Patrol or CYBERsitter . This will enable you to monitor more closely what is coming into the computer, and also, what you want ALLOWED into the computer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">However, don't rely completely upon this type of software, as they are far from foolproof. What can we do to stop illegal activity on the Net? It's a little to idealistic to believe that we will ever be able to stop it. The Internet is just like the real world. There will always be those who are going to exploit the Net and it's users. But unless we are willing to accept the Internet becoming a society of predators where sexual gratification is the rule and the weak and trusting children become subject to it, we have to fight it! Pornographic sites that allow access without age verification</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">Send an email to the owner of the site asking them to consider restriction. Be polite and explain why you are concerned. If you're very concerned, you might also report it to your local police. Sites promoting illegal activity Contact your local police, giving the address of the site, and any other relevant information that you may have. Child Pornography Undoubtedly, this is something that everybody (with the exception of the paedophile's themselves) want's to see stopped!</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">Sadly, child pornography flourishes on the Net and you'd probably be amazed at how easy it is to find. Infact, it's easier to find child porn than to find where to report it! How backward is that? Not only is child porn available on the World Wide Web, but also through IRQ and Newgroups. We are talking about children as young as 1 or 2 years old being sexually exploited by grown men. Pictures of bruised and abused children, forced to perform all kinds of sexual acts. There are thousands upon thousands of children being abused this way.</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">Some of them may very well be kids from our own neighbourhoods, enticed into situations they were unable to control or resolve. Paedophiles can be found anywhere, it any social group, and so can their victims! If you are a parent who believes that somebody is soliciting your child online, report it to your local police. Finally, I'd just like to say that although this article may scare off some parents from allowing their children to use the Net, if you act in a responsible manner, the likelihood of them coming into danger is decreased, whereas the likelihood of them gaining valuable knowledge is huge! Happy surfing! Pornography is freely available on the Internet, and although the serious players will go to certain lengths to ensure that minors aren't able to access their sites, it's still far too easy for anybody, of any age, to gain access to pornographic or illegal material. If you come across any child pornography on the Internet, PLEASE REPORT IT at InternetWatch (http://www.internetwatch.org.uk/hotline/hotline.html)</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">"Kids should work hard and try to excel in studies as well as in extra curricular activities and bring name and fame to their family, school, city and the nation.

It's designed to keep anyone from obtaining a child's personal information without a parent knowing about it and agreeing to it first. COPPA requires websites to explain their privacy policies on the site and get parental consent before collecting or using a child's personal information, such as a name, address, phone number, or Social Security number. The law also prohibits a site from requiring a child to provide more personal information than necessary to play a game or participate in a contest.</paragraph><paragraph parID="44">But even with this law, your kids' best online protection is you. By talking to them about potential online dangers and monitoring their computer use, you'll help them surf the Internet safely. Online Protection Tools Online tools are available that will let you control your kids' access to adult material and help protect them from Internet predators. No option is going to guarantee that they'll be kept away from 100% of the risks on the Internet. So it's important to be aware of your kids' computer activities and educate them about online risks. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) provide parent-control options to block certain material from coming into a computer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="45">You can also get software that helps block access to certain sites based on a "bad site" list that your ISP creates. Filtering programs can block sites from coming in and restrict personal information from being sent online. Other programs can monitor and track online activity. Also, make sure your kids create a screen name to protect their real identity. Getting Involved in Kids' Online Activities Aside from these tools, it's wise to take an active role in protecting your kids from Internet predators and sexually explicit materials online. To do that:</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">Become computer literate and learn how to block objectionable material. Keep the computer in a common area, not in individual bedrooms, where you can watch and monitor its use. Share an email account with your child so you can monitor messages. Bookmark kids' favorite sites for easy access. Spend time online together to teach your kids appropriate online behavior. Forbid your child from entering private chat rooms; block them with safety features provided by your Internet service provider or with special filtering software. Take your child seriously if he or she reports an uncomfortable online exchange.</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">Forward copies of obscene or threatening messages you or your kids get to your Internet service provider. Call the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at (800) 843-5678 if you're aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography online. Contact your local law enforcement agency or the FBI if your child has received child pornography via the Internet. Cookies can be disabled. Ask your Internet service provider for more information. Basic Rules Set up some simple rules for your kids to follow while they're using the Internet, such as:</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">Follow the rules you set, as well as those set by your Internet service provider. Never trade personal photographs in the mail or scanned photographs over the Internet. Never reveal personal information, such as address, phone number, or school name or location. Use only a screen name. Never agree to meet anyone from a chat room in person. Never respond to a threatening email or message. Always tell a parent about any communication or conversation that was scary.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">If your child has a new "friend," insist on being "introduced" online to that friend. Chat Room Caution Chat rooms are virtual online rooms where chat sessions take place. They're set up according to interest or subject, such as a favorite sport or TV show. Because people can communicate with each other alone or in a group, chat rooms are among the most popular destinations on the Web - especially for kids and teens. But chat rooms can pose hazards for kids. Some kids have met "friends" in chat rooms who were interested in exploiting them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">No one knows how common chat-room predators are, but pedophiles (adults who are sexually interested in children) are known to frequent chat rooms. These predators sometimes prod their online acquaintances to exchange personal information, such as addresses and phone numbers, thus putting the kids they are chatting with - and their families - at risk. Pedophiles often pose as teenagers in chat rooms. Because many kids have been told by parents not to give out their home phone numbers, pedophiles may encourage kids to call them; with caller ID the offenders instantly have the kids' phone numbers. Warning Signs Warning signs of a child being targeted by an online predator include spending long hours online, especially at night, phone calls from people you don't know, or unsolicited gifts arriving in the mail. If your child suddenly turns off the computer when you walk into the room, ask why and monitor computer time more closely.</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">Withdrawal from family life and reluctance to discuss online activities are other signs to watch for. Contact your local law enforcement agency or the FBI if your child has received pornography via the Internet or has been the target of an online sex offender. Taking an active role in your kids' Internet activities will help ensure that they benefit from the wealth of valuable information it offers without being exposed to any potential dangers. The Internet can be a wonderful resource for kids. They can use it to research school reports, communicate with teachers and other kids, and play interactive games. Kids who are old enough to punch in a few letters on the keyboard can literally access the world. But that access can also pose hazards.</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">For example, an 8-year-old might do an online search for "Lego." But with just one missed keystroke, the word "Legs" is entered instead, and the child may be directed to a slew of websites with a focus on legs - some of which may contain pornographic material. That's why it's important to be aware of what your kids see and hear on the Internet, who they meet, and what they share about themselves online. Just like any safety issue, it's wise to talk with your kids about your concerns, take advantage of resources to protect them, and keep a close eye on their activities. Internet Safety Laws A federal law, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), was created to help protect kids online. Be aware that posting messages to chat rooms reveals a user's email address to others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">Monitor your credit card and phone bills for unfamiliar account charges. Find out what, if any, online protection is offered by your child's school, after-school center, friends' homes, or anyplace where kids could use a computer without your supervision. Many sites use "cookies," devices that track specific information about the user, such as name, email address, and shopping preferences.

Here is a list of the PowerPoint presentations provided to West Orange Public Schools parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">Online Predators | Internet Predators Perhaps one of the most challenging problems that parents face when protecting their children in the online environment is protecting them from online predators. Sexual predators no longer have to take to the streets to find their next possible victim. All they have to do is simply target their next victim using websites such as Facebook or chat rooms. Research has shown that 82% of online sex crimes against minors begin with the offender using the child's social networking site to gain information. The safety of children in the online environment should never be taken for granted. Parents must know of and use the many resources available to help protect their children from the dangers of the internet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">Recognizing an Online Predator Online predators can often be hard to identify. Because outside of the online environment, they often seem to be completely normal people. While studies have shown that the average online predator is white, male, and middle-aged, online predators can be of any race, age or gender. The professions of online predators may vary. Contrary to what people may think, many of them hold respectful jobs and positions in society. Will often look for children who are emotionally vulnerable</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">May pretend to be someone he or she is not in order to take advantage of children Will be very good at internet lingo to help coerce young victims Will become more provocative as he or she feels the victim is beginning to trust Both children and parents must always remain aware of the characteristics of an online predator. Ever more so, they must be aware of the dangers of getting involved with an online predator. The dangers include: Identity theft.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">Some online predators are out to get personal information rather than physically harming victims. They will ask for information such as social security numbers, home addresses, full names, date of birth, etc. Children must be taught to never give out personal information regardless of who asks for it. Accounts can be compromised, and one never knows who is actually on the other end. Sexual solicitation. Many online predators use chat rooms and social networking sites such as Facebook to solicit sex from minors. After making strong connections, they attempt to set up meeting places with the minor to carry out the acts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">An alarming fact is that in a study done by the National Center for Missing Children reported that 44% of sexual solicitation came from children under the age of 18. Sexual predators aren't always adults. Child Pornography or exposure to pornography. Online predators are sly and often know how to get what they want. After establishing a trusting relationship, online predators will request nude photos of their targeted victims and offer photos in return. Kidnapping/rape. Some sexual predators are willing to go to the extreme with targeted victims.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">They use information made available on social networking sites to gather information such as where the child lives, his day to day activities and routines, who he hangs out with, etc. Through the social networking page, the predator is able to gather enough information to commit heinous crimes against children. Predators who choose their victims through social networking are often hard to identify once the crime takes place. This is especially true if the predator never actually contacted the victim using the social networking site but instead just used it to gain a wealth of information that made the victim an easy target. What can parents do? The Kids Safety @ Facebook survey conducted by MinorMonitor.com found that more than half of parents whose kids use the social networking site Facebook are worried about their children interacting with online predators. Parents should not only be "worried."</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">The problem is not going away. As Facebook becomes increasingly popular among kids, it also peaks the interest of internet predators. Parents must take initiative now to protect their children. Make children aware of the dangers. Because Facebook users are becoming younger and younger, it can be difficult for parents to really explain the dangers of the website. Children should know what an online predator is and be aware of the characteristics and warning signs that follow predators. Get involved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">Letting children have free access to the internet should never be an option. 51% of parents surveyed said that they monitor their child's profile by having login information. While this is certainly a step in the right direction, it isn't enough. Parents must utilize this information and dig deep into what is really going on in the online community. They must know what red flags to look for and look for them often. Set boundaries. Parents can help reduce the risk associated with online predators by setting boundaries.</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">Boundaries should include a limitation on the time spent on the internet, strict guidelines on who their child can "friend," open communication about actions on social networking sites, and a "no deletion" policy. The problem with setting boundaries is that kids can often find ways to outsmart their parents. Parents should never depend only on boundaries to protect their children. Parental control software. With the presence of online predators increasing daily, parents should cling to options made available to them by people who have realized the dangers and taken initiative to provide protection. Software programs such as that provided by MinorMonitor give parents the upper hand in protecting their children from many of the dangers that exist in the online environment, including online predators. With the use of exceptional software, parents can have somewhat of a peace of mind knowing someone else is watching out for their child too.</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">The presence of predators online will never go away. Parents can only arm themselves with information, tools, and involvement to help protect their children. The ultimate protection comes when parents begin using internet control to reduce the risks. Listed below are a few common characteristics or traits that may be helpful in identifying an online predator. Appears trusting at first May pretend to share common interests with targeted victims Will more than likely engage in as many activities with children as possible</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">Why? Unfortunately, many of these meetings end up with a devastating ending. For this reason, parents should utilize parental control to intercept sexual solicitation of minors by online predators. There are many predators who are looking specifically for nude photos of children. This is why it is so important that parents use internet control effectively. They should be doing whatever possible to protect their children from online predators. What can parents do to help reduce the risk of their children becoming involved with an online predator?</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">Explaining Anxiety to Kids In the absence of other explanations, kids assume that their fears and worries make sense, are messages to heed, or at the very least that they are stuck listening to them. They usually believe that their level of fear is an accurate reflection of how dangerous a situation is, instead of knowing that their fear is a reaction to thinking scary thoughts about a situation. Like cracking the code in a math problem, when parents step in and relabel worry as just one line of thinking which can be challenged by alternative tracks, this opens up possibilities for new ways of understanding what is happening in the mind and the body and gives kids a new sense of control and hope. Helping kids know that being afraid isn't the same as being in danger is an empowering discovery. Understanding that hearing scary stories would make any one afraid, kids can learn that one important way of reducing anxiety is by changing the story their mind is telling them about the situation. Once they are less afraid, it will be easier to approach events and situations which have previously been avoided.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">For ideas on how to explain anxiety to your child click here to go to Script for Very Young Children and click here to go to Script for School Aged Children and Teens. Follow some of these guidelines: Make and Explain why there are online rules. Online rules are essentially the same as other "stranger/danger" rules. You wouldn't befriend a stranger on the street, so don't befriend a stranger online. Also stress the importance of never giving out passwords to anyone (except you of course). Keep tabs on what they're doing online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">OnlineFamily.Norton is a free service that lets you monitor your kids online activities through alerts sent to your email or mobile phone. Rather than just blocking certain sites, this service is designed to foster communication between you and your kids when they are breaking the rules. Make sure you are their Friend online. As an online "friend," you can actually learn more about them and their interests. Also befriend their friends if you can. That way you'll know what is happening in their social circles at school. Know their passwords .</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">Make sure you know all your children's passwords so you can check up on them at times. Do your children use the computer in Hampton Roads It starts in infancy. The toys of today are basically all computers. Push a button, hear a cow moo. Push another and hear how an "A" sounds. Computers are a part of our life and it starts earlier than you think.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">My kids started playing on a real computer at age 2. I bet many of your kids started even earlier than that. As children get older, they move into...yes, you guessed it...Social Networking. Before you know it, your child will ask for a Facebook page. Like it or not, kids social lives include Facebook. A Symantec study shows that kids spend nearly 40 hours a month online! In order to take advantage of the opportunities online, children need to act responsibly with your involvement and guidance to help the make the right choices.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">As an advocate for live-in childcare utilizing an au pair, I know there are advantages to having an au pair with your children at home. An au pair will monitor your children's computer use just like you would. With an au pair home while your children are doing their homework, there is an adult dedicated to supervising their computer time. Of course, the au pair will not watch their every key-stroke, but an au pair will walk through the room, just as you would, and casually glance at the computer to make sure it is being used properly. Because computer usage is beginning at such early ages, let's take advantages of the opportunities and protect our children from the dangers.

The Importance of Anonymity Ensuring that your children's identity remains anonymous on the Internet can help safeguard them from many dangers. Giving out personal information can make your children susceptible to exploitation, harassment or enticement from would-be cyber-criminals. When discussing anonymity with your children, be sure to communicate that "personal information" is not simply their name, address, phone number, and email address. Revealing details such as the city they live in, the school they attend, and the locations in which they socialize with friends can make them possible targets for online notoriety. How to help your children stay anonymous: Help them choose a screen name that does not reveal personal information.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">Their screen name should never use any part of their real name or give any indication of where they live. Help them adjust the preferences in their instant messaging service or blog so it does not reveal their personal information, for example, their real name and email address should not be listed in local directories or public profiles. It is also important to explain to your children that, even after taking these precautions, they can never be truly anonymous if they reveal any personal information - especially in forums such as chat-rooms, blogs, or MySpace. It is easy to give out personal information without realizing it, so they must always be conscious of what information they provide. The Importance of Security The Internet can seem like a safe venue to make contacts. Instant messaging, blogs, and chat-rooms encourage sharing contacts to grow an online community. Friends will 'introduce' their friends, and soon your children have a network of contacts they only know in virtual world, who may or may not be worthy of their trust.</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">Children need to understand that security online goes beyond simply not revealing personal details. For your part, installing and using advanced Internet control software on your computer can help filter out harmful content and adult material that your children should not be exposed to. How to help your children stay secure: Explain that they should never download files or open links sent from someone they do not personally know and trust - even a friend of a friend. Links and files could contain harmful viruses or intrusive software that can harm your computer or collect personal information. Explain to them that they should never tell their passwords to anyone, even to a friend, since nothing in cyber-space can be guaranteed to be secure. If on a public computer (for example, at a school or a library), instruct them to never check the "save password" or "login automatically" buttons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">Explain that under no circumstances should they physically meet up with anyone they have met online - even if they're a friend of a friend. Above all, encourage them to trust their instincts - if they feel unsure about anyone or anything online, they should talk to you or a teacher.

The third myth centers around kids raised on the net as in some way being more at risk. We've all heard the stories about stranger danger and the forms it takes online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">There are many anecdotes that are specific to these online spaces and do seem to describe new, unique dangers. Some of the risk is real, to be sure, and the Berkman Center is actually working on some materials to enhance online safety. However, objective data shows this generation is in no more danger than previous ones. The threats have simply been re-distributed, as these new spaces have opened up. The last myth is that kids raised steeped in digital spaces are meaner. Bullying online certainly seems to be on the rise. Does this support the myth?</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">Palfrey and his students were skeptical, Diana in particular dismissed it as the same behavior with which each generation has dealt just in new environs. In such public spaces, this activity is more easily observed by parents and teachers than when it is in the school yard or the playground. It also can have a persistence aspect, in the form of logs and other retained data that it doesn't in traditional spaces. Diana also felt that there was another, new dimension to online bullying that "being reactive [to this spectacle can] cause more harm than good". She thinks it really is just part of normal socialization, as much as parents of any generation want to spare their kids the worst of it. Interference in offline spaces can be just as disruptive. She was also skeptical that surveillance was a good answer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">As a digital native, her advice to parents is to communicate openly.

Whether it is identity theft or online predators, parents should be overly concerned about their children each and every time they have access to the web.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">Studies have shown that parents are aware of the dangers that exist but many feel that "it could never happen to them" and proceed to let their children have uncensored access to websites such as Facebook. Parents must always have their guards up and vow to do what they can to protect their children. Protection comes through internet control. Internet control, also known as parental control, can potentially help lessen or eliminate the possible dangers that kids face on a daily basis as they use the internet. It begins with parents. Parents must be willing to get heavily involved in every single aspect of what their kids are doing on the internet. What are they researching?</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">What websites do they visit most? Are they posting private information on public forum? How much time are they spending on the internet? Are they facebooking every detail of their private life? Internet control can help a parent answer all of these questions and more. It is an effective tool that parents can use to protect their children. Means of Internet Control</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">While it will take up time, controlling what a child does on the internet does not have to be hard. Listed below are a few ways that internet control can help parents protect children. Alerts parents to sexual predators on the internet. Helps parents block websites that may be inappropriate. Reduces the chances of a child being cyber bullied via the internet. Helps parents monitor how much time they spend on the internet. 22% of teenagers log on to their favorite social media network at least 10 times a day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">Internet control can actually deter them from using the site so often. Makes it more difficult for kids to hide discussions about potential drug and alcohol use. These are just a few of the many reasons why parents should take advantage of internet control as a means of protecting their children on dangerous websites such as Facebook. The following are a few creative ways for parents to take initiative. Invest in parental control software. There is software available online that can help detect potential problems on websites such as Facebook. While Facebook has a policy against allowing young kids to participate in the social network, the Kids Safety @ Facebook Survey found that 38% of all kids on Facebook are under the age of 13.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">It is vital that parents invest in software to aid in protecting their children. Computer parental controls. Many computers come with programs or software designed to help protect children online. Unfortunately, few parents actually take the time to learn how to use the controls. This, combined with parental control software offered by companies such as Minor Monitor can ensure that the utmost control is offered to parents who want to ensure the safety of their child when visiting risky websites such as Facebook. Talking about computer safety and making children aware of the dangers. Communication can solve many problems.</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Parents can use communication as a tool to combat the dangers. Practicing internet safety as a family can also help. Safety Tips Parents are often reluctant to discuss internet safety with their children simply because they aren't sure what to say. In 2011, Consumer Reports reported that only 10% of parents of kids under the age of 10 had "frank" talks with their kids about internet safety. Providing them with safety tips to help guide the conversation may encourage parents to sit down and have the talk. It is not enough to just tell kids this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">Never agree to meet someone you don't know. A child must know what could potentially happen when meeting someone they have been talking to on the internet. It's important that parents bring in real life situations to help explain the dangers of it. The safety tips listed above are just a few of the many tips that parents should go over with their children on a regular basis in an effort to keep them safe. A general list of internet safety tips must always be visible. Crimes on the internet are quickly becoming the fastest growing crimes in the United States. A large percentage of them are children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">Parents must utilize internet control and establish rules and regulations for internet use in the household. The problem isn't going away. Parents must step up to the plate and take control in an effort to keep their children safe. Terms associated with Internet Control parental internet control, facebook control, social monitoring control This statement couldn't be further from the truth. How?</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">Being an overbearing parent is okay when it comes to protecting children from the many dangers that the internet possesses. What seems to be impossible is now possible with creative and inventive tools to help parents gain control over what their kids are doing while on the internet. What is Internet Control? Controlling every detail of a child's visits to websites such as Facebook and other dangerous websites sounds hard, right? Wrong! The safety tips below are conversation starters that can help parents teach children about the dangers of the internet and how to stay safe while using it. Never give out personal information.</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">They must know what personal information is and be heavily instructed against giving out this type of information. People that you don't know on the internet should always be considered strangers. Just as a parent instructs his child to never talk to strangers, children should be instructed to never talk to strangers in an online environment too. "Friending" should only be approved by parents. Confide in an adult if a threatening email or message appears regardless of who it is from. Parents must let their children know that it is okay to feel scared and if it happens, to contact them immediately. Never send pictures to people online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">Sexual predators do exist and are preying on children via Facebook and other websites. Children must be taught not to send pictures of strangers who ask for them. Who are the victims? Effective. The view from Italy Ferdinando Offelli, principal of Scuola Media Statale (Junior High) in the Vicenza area of northern Italy, wanted online-safety information for teachers in and parents connected with his school. "From all over Italy there is a great demand about this kind of material," he wrote The Children's Partnership , a national nonprofit children's advocacy organization in the US.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">He'd found their "Parents' Guide to the Information Superhighway" (available in their Web site ) and translated it into Italian. His reason? "The fact is that in Italy in these months, parents are getting more and more aware about the problem of the safety in the Internet," Mr. Offelli wrote, "and there's a greater concern and interest in every information. As a man of school, I can't limit myself in defending pupils in classroom. I want to help parents, libraries and social institutions in managing the same problem. I consider your Guide, even translated into Italian, very useful for the purpose, and that's why I spent some months in translating it into Italian." Then, lacking funds for printing and distribution, enterprising principal that he was, he asked his school's Internet service provider, Keycomm Italia, to sponsor the printed edition.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">On April 30 the Italian version of the Guide was distributed free to participants at a national meeting of "the Italian UNICEF." Now The Children's Partnership is onto another project even more accessible to parents new to the Internet. Now available in both English and Spanish (the latter with links to Spanish-language sites), the "Parents' Online Resource Center" is a Web guide specially tailored for 'Net newcomers in libraries and community centers. It's designed to work well as the default home page (the first Web page people see) on connected computers in those public spaces. So we'd love it if our subscribers who are librarians would tell us what you think (just e-mail us at feedback@netfamilynews.org). Certainly it's one of the more international projects of its kind. French, German, and Italian versions come next.</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">Web New Briefs Free PCs: the latest twist Great news for the college-bound or any parent who's thinking about shelling out for kids to have their own PCs for school! Remember when the phone companies started giving away cellular phones just to get us to sign up for their phone service for three years? According to the Associated Press, via the New York Times , America Online, Microsoft, and Prodigy are offering free PCs - or rebates that make them free or very cheap. You can get the machines through dealerships like Circuit City, Staples, and economy PC companies like eMachines in exchange for making a three-year commitment (around $790) to buy AOL, MS, or Prodigy Internet service. Big computermakers like Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and Compaq are expected to offer similar packages as soon as they're finished striking deals with Internet service providers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">The catch? Computer monitors ($100-$300) probably won't be included in these deals, so you'll pay extra for that rather essential part of the system. And if you're thinking about switching from dialup to higher-speed Internet access via cable modem or DSL (a "digital subscriber line" with your phone company), you're stuck with that three-year dial-up commitment. But those don't seem like deal-breakers, really, and if a computer is all you want, you can still go to auctions at CNET , Amazon.com , or eBay or directly to manufacturer eMachines or dealer Cyberian Outpost for low-cost computer opps. There's something quite attractive about cutting out the middleman. According to SiliconValley.com , borrower who used QuickenMortgage.com saved $3,000 in brokers' fees by getting his mortgage online. The number of online borrowers is not great right now, but it's growing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">Forrester Research expects the number of mortgages handled online to grow from 1.5% this year to 9.6% in 2003. The interesting point that SiliconValley.com brings out: Online mortgage companies may be victims of their own success: By intensifying competition and driving down prices, they could put themselves out of business. The other big argument offline (traditional) mortgage companies offer is the customer-service one. They say they're "relational," while Internet companies are purely "transactional." Big words, those. That's the choice the Internet and e-commerce are increasingly offering us: convenience, low prices, and customer-in-charge online vs. personal service (and lowering prices, thanks to the new competition e-commerce brings) offline. Antique dress patterns, anyone?</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">What was that last one?) Well, we threw that last item in because we found a wonderful story in USAToday that really explains how the Internet helps people with somewhat obscure interests not only find each other but feed their passions for, in this case, those antique dress patterns. In fact, the story is constantly changing because the Web is, too. For example, now there's eBay (and other auctions, some mentioned above in the free-PC story), where people who are passionate about patterns or comics or baseball cards or Beanie Babies can find each other a little more easily. Not that collectors of pre-1920s dress patterns needed eBay. According to USAToday, seamstress Jan Engan started the Vintage Pattern Lending Library long before eBay came along. It's a gentler environment than the wild free-for-all of a public auction, perhaps a reflection of the unique community it serves.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">Remember when we reported on a site that was very popular after the Columbine High tragedy (in "'Nerds' defined" )? Just to keep you posted, the site whose tagline reads, "News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters," has been bought. According to The Industry Standard , the buyer is Andover.net , "a more buttoned-down collection of news, software downloads, Web-site tools and tips" for Web developers. For Webheads in your house who get their news from Slashdot, the site's founder and editor, Cmder. Taco (aka Rob Malda), assures his readers that Slashdot won't change. He'll just be able to pay writers now.</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">Way to go, Rob! Speaking of Web design Playing it safe The mother of Teresa and Sean Hall works as a deputy in the Muscogee County Sheriff's Office, but her children were among the first to take part in a free program aimed at keeping them safe. The program, radKIDS Inc., was designed to give children the tools and confidence they need to recognize, avoid, resist and escape danger through hands-on activities, role playing, demonstrations and classroom work. Teresa said her favorite part was the last day, when each member of the class performed newly acquired martial arts skills on an instructor pretending to be a "bad guy." Internet safety also is discussed in the radKIDS curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">"I really am a big stickler for Internet safety," Rice said. "One of my biggest pet peeves is people preying on little kids online." The U.S. Department of Justice estimated that in 2005, 77 million children had access to the Internet. "I think that as a parent in this day and age, you need to be very aware of what's going on out there," Rice said. Children need to be aware as well that there are some bad people out there who may try to trick them into looking at something they're not supposed to look at, or into doing something they don't want to, Rice said. The folks behind radKIDS left it up to cartoon "radKID" Corey to explain Internet safety to the kids. Corey also talks about gun safety, phone safety, electric safety, kitchen safety, general play safety and dog defense.</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">Because of radKIDS, both children know 911 is the number to call if they're in danger. The program's Web site is www.radkids.org . Teenagers are usually well aware of the dangers of the Internet but they tend to be careless in some situations. They crave independence and if you don't let them use the Internet at home they can easily access it elsewhere. Keep a close watch on webcam use and explain that images posted on the Internet can end up in anyone's hands. Make sure your kids treat other Internet users with respect when they go online. It is more effective to control their Internet use and keep the channels of communication open than to try to ban the Internet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">Here are some points to consider and discuss with your teens. Warn them about the dangers of giving out personal information (name, address, phone number, photos, passwords). Use parental control software to block inappropriate content and manage your kids' online experience. Visit Videotron's Web site to learn more about the free parental control software for Internet clients. Don't give your kids your password; that would defeat the purpose of the parental control. If they are inclined to talk to strangers, suggest safer practices: talking to friends, to people they trust, to organizations for teens like Tel-Jeunes, or just keeping a diary (on paper). Take an interest in their hobbies and in what they do online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">Even if teenagers are not always eager to talk, try to keep the channels of communication open, trust them, and encourage them to come to you with problems. Set clear rules for your kids' Internet use and consequences for breaking the rules. Draw up an online code of conduct , keep it in plain view, and discuss it regularly. Explain that you want to keep them safe, not prevent them from getting the most out of the Internet. Children need boundaries in order to feel secure and supported. Don't panic if your teens look for content related to sex. Just make sure they understand the difference between virtual reality and the real world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">Limit your kids' access to the Internet, especially after school if they are home alone. If they have other interests, they will be less likely to become addicted to the Internet . Make sure you know at least their user name and email address. Keep the computer in a common area (family room, kitchen, living room, etc.) and place the screen so you can see it. From time to time, check what sites your kids visit and what they do online. It is normal for teens to want to use a language and codes that you can't understand (especially in chat rooms). Don't fight it but make sure they don't create a parallel universe on the Internet by inventing a fake identity or making up a different life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">Keep an eye on your telephone and Internet bills to make sure your kids are not making transactions accidentally or without your approval. Know who your kids are talking to and ask them if they know everyone on their contact list. Know their friends and, if possible, their friends' parents. Keep an eye on their chats. As a rule, don't let your kids talk on the phone with strangers they met on the Internet and don't let them meet online acquaintances in real life. If there is a compelling reason to do so, make sure there is a responsible adult present. Explain to your kids that it is easy to lie on the Internet and that people don't always tell the truth about themselves.</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">Warn them about cyberbullying, which is a growing problem. Here are a few of the reasons why people worry so much about internet predators... You might have heard that "1 in 5 young people has received an unwanted sexual solicitation online." But the truth is that only 3% of those teens who've reported a sexual solicitation were actually asked to meet someone offline, call them on the phone, or accept gifts. Most kids just ignored those unwanted emails or shrugged them off as unimportant or just annoying. If you ask parents about the biggest risk online, most will say "Internet sexual predators." This ties into what parents have been worried about for decades -- "stranger danger," or a fear of abductions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">However the number of cases where a stranger has abducted a child is often far lower than most people realize. It is usually under 400 cases a year. Everyone thinks old men are the only ones trying to seduce you online. But most sexual solicitations come from someone your own age, or someone you know, not form someone looking to molest you. Reporting sexual predators is big business for the media, and for companies selling products designed to protect children from sexual predators online. So we may hear about this far more than we need to. The Internet and new technologies are foreign to most parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">People fear what they don't understand. What does all this mean? It certainly doesn't mean that we don't need to watch out for Internet sexual predators. Because they are out there. And they are hurting and even killing kids they meet. So how do we balance the hype with the seriousness of the issue? Keep on reading and find out!</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">I guess the internet reflects that trend....the thing is, because there are SO MANY ways of blocking unwanted online contact, most teens who do have sustained contact with a creeper (on or off line) do so of their own volition. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule, but in GENERAL.... the "block this user" button really is just a click away. and I mean seriously... AGES AND AGES AND AGES.... and then I went to a lecture where they explained all this stuff, and then I learned something new... obviously... Anyway, my point is, don't feel bad because you don't know something. (and yes I'm talking about those giant invisible purple pigeons [that have target practice] that are the reason that there is dirty looking snow... contrary to popular belief that dirty snow is caused by car exhaust and dirt...) Trust me, I even fell for it a little while, getting freaked out and telling one of my friends' sisters not to go onto myspace for a while. There's help for spam-clogged email in-boxes ("spam" is Internet slang for unsolicited commercial email). In his column for the Los Angeles Times this week, SafeKids.com's Larry Magid reviews "an excellent new book" on the subject - "Overcome E-Mail Overload," by Kaitlin Duck Sherwood ($29.95) - saying it's "at least partially helped him tame the e-mail beast."</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">There are editions for both Eudora and Outlook Express email apps. Here's one very helpful tidbit Larry passes along: "Don't respond to invitations to have your name removed from spam lists. This is how spammers verify that you're a real person. The result can be more spam, not less." It's fascinating to watch how society processes a new challenge, which is exactly what kids' online safety presents to parents, educators, children's advocates, Internet businesses, and governments worldwide. In this giant jigsaw puzzle, each conversation with an expert in this field fills in the picture a bit more. A recent phone conversation with Nigel Williams, director of the nonprofit Childnet International in London, added a whole chunk of puzzle pieces to the picture.</paragraph><paragraph parID="115">As we mentioned last week , the US's biggest struggle - which explains why children's Internet protection laws keep getting challenged in court - is the need to protect kids while protecting everyone's free-speech rights. In Europe, multiple languages is a minor problem compared to the many countries' differing laws and definitions of "pornography" and "age of consent [to sexual activity]." And even in a single country, "age of consent" can be different from the age used in child pornography legislation, the Association of Internet Hotline Providers in Europe points out at its INHOPE.org (the page shows 10 countries' approaches to these issues). But Europe clearly has the will to protect its online kids, witness the European Commission's Safer Internet Action Plan and the way it has channeled funding into research, online-safety measures, coordination, and public awareness. "The first people to really recognize the issue [in Europe] were the European Commission," Nigel told us. He explained with welcome candor that "the drive initially was the fear that the bad stories of the Net would prevent growth of this medium - growth that's important to the economic sector and manufacturing companies in Europe.... So they [specifically the EC's Directorate General] provided a place where governments could come and talk, then industry came in quite quickly, then organizations like ourselves." This was happening around the time that the Communications Decency Act (CDA) was struck down by the Supreme Court in the States (June '97), Nigel pointed out, and Europe was watching closely: "There was quite a lot of feeling that we've got to do this better than the Americans."</paragraph><paragraph parID="116">To be taken with a grain of salt, yes, but the comment says something about both the Internet, as a new medium in which to test the First Amendment, and about the US - the country where the Internet got its start - working through how to deal with this unruly new challenge. Where Europe shines is its hotlines, and the international cooperation behind them. "By mid-'97 there were hotlines in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the UK," Nigel told us, "receiving reports from individual Internet users about child pornography largely." He told us they were all unique. The Norwegian one was started by a child welfare organization, "the Dutch one was put together by some Net users concerned about free-speech issues (they didn't want the Net to be tarnished by this)," the German one came out of the Internet industry, the British one was industry-funded but had a board with non-industry representatives. Now there are 13 child pornography hotlines in 11 countries, according to a report just given in Luxembourg for "Safer Internet Awareness Day" by Richard Swetenham of the EC's Information Society office. The latest iteration of this strength is the new educational Internet-safety hotlines for which the EC just this week announced it has allocated "semi-permanent" funding.</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">These new hotlines will "help educate children and adults about the dangers of unsupervised Internet chat lines, as well as acting as an advisory and reporting mechanism for suspicious activities," reports Newsbytes.com . Preference will be given to multi-country hotlines, the EC said. Where the US shines is in tangible, emergency help for online kids at risk (from cyberstalkers, pedophiles, etc.) via the CyberTipline at the National Center for Missing &amp;amp; Exploited Children . Behind the Tipline is unprecedented cooperation among police departments and law-enforcement agencies nationwide, the FBI, US Customs, and the US Postal Service. But that's another story - for next week. Of course, this is only part of a huge, unfolding picture puzzle of worldwide efforts to protect online kids. What's clear already is, "we have to think internationally," as Nigel said.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">Here are some links toward a more complete picture: The Baltic Sea states' new organization, the Child Centre, and companion Web site , designed to educate about and help prevent the sexual exploitation of children in the region. Who decides what's appropriate for all children? is one of the tough questions in the debate about whether kids should have their own "space" on the Internet and who decides what's in it. In recent discussion on Capitol Hill over a proposed bill to add a ". kids suffix last November amid concerns about who would set the standards for child-appropriate material," reports eSchoolNews.com , but US lawmakers tried to force the issue with legislation. The problem is, Assistant Secretary of Commerce Nancy Victory told the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet, other countries object to such a law because "the United States should not establish guidelines for the World Wide Web."</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">Apparently realizing this to be true (or frustrated with ICANN's process), the lawmakers amended the law to create a kids' space under the ". us" TLD that the US government does control. According to eSchoolNews, the amended bill says that "only sites with material deemed appropriate for children under 13 could get a '. Participation by Web publishers would be voluntary, and the sites would be continuously monitored. A parent or school administrator could restrict a child's computer so it could visit only those sites. The bill would establish an independent board that would set criteria for use of '. Here's Newsbytes.com 's helpful addition to the discussion.</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">But what do you think? How would a "fenced off" dot-kids area of the Net help protect online kids beyond the protections currently available? And do you think a US government-appointed body should decide what goes in it? Childnet, which spearheaded the UK hotline, was concerned about the need to coordinate all this, Nigel said, since all the hotlines were "receiving reports about similar material, having to work out what to do with the reports, how to relate to law enforcement, how to deal with volunteers, how to decide if material was illegal or not, how not to be infiltrated by pedophiles. A survey by Britain's Consumer's Association found that 40% of UK Internet users have accidentally come across pornography while online, according to Reuters (via Yahoo News ). Meanwhile, file-sharing just got a lot easier, with Microsoft, America Online, and Yahoo having all added file-sharing enhancements to their instant-messaging services, according to Wired News . As in any large community, there are dangers our children encounter in cyberspace.</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">But, since our children know more than we do about cyberspace, we worry about how we can teach them to avoid those dangers. Don't panic... those dangers can be managed using the same old warnings we've always used. We just need to translate them into cyberspace terms. The following tips can help! Talk regularly with your children about what they are doing online. Tell them they have to be careful what they say and to be polite online. Tell them that they need to tell you if something bothers them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">Respect your teen's privacy, but tell your child that you may check their e-mails/texts if you become concerned. Explain the consequences for violating those rules. Consider establishing a parent-child internet use contract. Be aware of warning signs that might indicate that your son or daughter is being bullied, such as reluctance to use the computer, a change in the child's behavior and mood, or reluctance to go to school. Consider installing parental control filtering software and tracking programs; but do not rely solely on these tools. Be equally alert to the possibility that your child is bullying others online, even if they don't mean to. Document any bullying.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">Contact the school to enlist the help of the school psychologist, the school counselor, the principal, or the resource officer if you discover bullying.

Project Safe Childhood national media campaign to combat the increase of sexual predators using the Internet to entice and sexually exploit children. Stresses importance of knowing where your kids go online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="156">The Media Awareness Network has created six educational games and interactive student modules for K-12 students (complete with extensive Teacher's Guides) to help kids to develop cybersafety skills. There has been widespread misunderstanding of a 2005 study that found that 1 in 7 youths had received an unwanted online sexual solicitation but the authors of that study - the Crimes Against Children Research Center posted a fact sheet that explains that these solicitations are typically not from predators and most of the recipients of the solicitations did not view them as serious. ConnectSafely.org advises young people to "be cautious when communicating with people you don't know in person, especially if the conversation starts to be about sex or physical details. If they persist, call your local police or contact CyberTipline.com ." A 2011 study from the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project found that 15% of teens say they have been the "target of online meanness and 19% had been bullied. Girls are more likely to have experienced what we typically call "cyberbullying," while boys and girls are roughly equal when it comes to in person bullying. A 2011 EU Kids Online ( PDF ) study from the London School of Economics found that "across Europe, 6% of 9- to 16-year-old Internet users have been bullied online, and 3% confess to having bullied others."</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">In the U.S., the Cyberbullying Research Center  found that 20% of "randomly selected 11 to 18 year old students in 2010 indicated they had been a victim  at some point in their life ." Learn to use the services privacy protections but, even if you have your privacy settings turned on, there is the possibility not only that what you post could affect your reputation among your friends who can see it but there is the further possibility that someone could copy and paste it and share it with others. The biggest problem with spending too much time online is that it can take away from other important activities including physical activity and in-person socializing. There are no hard and set rules as to how much time kids or even adults should be spending online, but if it starts to interfere with other aspects of your or your child's life, then you've almost certainly gotten to that point. One interesting piece of research looked at the relationship between exposure to both violent and non-violent X-rated material on adolescents found that  "consumers of violent x-rated material are almost six times more likely than nonconsumers of violent x-rated material to report sexually aggressive behavior" while those looking at non-violent x-rated material are no more likely to report sexual aggression than those who haven't looked at that material." What you post can affect how people feel about you and what others post can affect you as well. For example, if someone posts rude or mean comments about you (sometimes called cyberbullying), it can be hurtful and demeaning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="158">There are also some security risks, especially if others get hold of your password or if you click on links in social networks that take you to websites that distribute malicious software ("malware") that can infect your computer or phone. Children need to be cautioned not to give out information in any chat area that could allow a person to contact them in the real world and parents need to be aware of the possibility (however unlikely) that someone could be using these chat tools to engage their children in inappropriate conversations. Other "dangers" of online gaming include spending too much time online and spending too much money on games that require or encourage in-game purchases. Today's smart phones are pocket-sized computers so just about anything that can be done with a PC can also be done with a smart phone, including email, web surfing and live chat along with texting. Kids can be bullied via cell phones and, like all media, there is the danger of spending too much time or using the phone at inappropriate times. It's a good idea for kids (and adults too) to turn their phones off at night when it's time to sleep. If you get an email that asks you for a password and user name, question whether it's legitimate and - even if you think it is - don't click on any links but type in the address of the site yourself to avoid getting caught up in a "phishing" scheme.</paragraph><paragraph parID="159">Make sure you have secure passwords and that you never give them out to anyone (except kids sharing them with parents). Be sure that your computer or device's operating system are up-to-date and use up-to-date security software. Be very careful about any apps you install on a smart phone or software you download on a computer and also be aware of games and other apps you run on social networking sites. Filters can usually prevent young children from accidentally stumbling on troubling or inappropriate material, but they are less effective at keeping older kids and teens from deliberately visiting blocked sites. If you do use a tool, it's a very good idea to tell your kids that it's there and for parents to think about how to wean their kids away from filtering and monitoring as they get older and/or more responsible. Do consider configuring your search engine for "safe" or filtered search or use SafeKids.com's Child Safe Search (powered by Google). Basic Internet Safety for Kids</paragraph><paragraph parID="160">Tue, 08/31/2010 - 12:16 The Internet is a wonderful place for learning and entertainment, but like the world around us, it can pose dangers if precautions are not taken. Allowing free access puts your child, your computer and your personal data at risk. The National Cyber Security Alliance's K-12 Working Group, which meets monthly to discuss teaching our young people online safety, developed the following tips for parents: Remain positively engaged. Pay attention to and know the online environments your children use. Surf the Internet with them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="161">Appreciate your children's participation in their online communities and show interest in their friends. Try to react constructively when they encounter inappropriate material. Make it a teachable moment. Top of page. Support their good choices . Expand your children's online experience and their autonomy when developmentally appropriate, as they demonstrate competence in safe and secure online behavior and good decision making. Protect your hardware.</paragraph><paragraph parID="162">Safety and security start with protecting all family computers. Install a security suite (antivirus, antispyware, and firewall) that is set to update automatically. Keep your operating system, Web browser, and other software current as well, and back up computer files on a regular basis. Know the protection features of the Web sites and software your children use. Your Internet service provider (ISP) may have tools to help you manage young children's online experience (e.g., selecting approved Web sites, monitoring the amount of time they spend online, or limiting the people who can contact them) and may have other security features, such as pop-up blockers. Third-party tools are also available. But remember that your home isn't the only place they can go online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="163">Review the privacy settings of social network sites, cell phones, and other social tools your children use. Decide together which settings provide the appropriate amount of protection for each child. Teach critical thinking. Help your children identify safe, credible Web sites and other digital content, and be cautious about clicking on, downloading, posting, and uploading content. Explain the implications. Help your children understand the public nature of the Internet and its risks as well as benefits. Be sure they know that any digital info they share, such as emails, photos, or videos, can easily be copied and pasted elsewhere, and is almost impossible to take back.</paragraph><paragraph parID="164">Things that could damage their reputation, friendships, or future prospects should not be shared electronically. Help them be good digital citizens. Remind your children to be good "digital friends" by respecting personal information of friends and family and not sharing anything about others that is potentially embarrassing or hurtful. Just saying "no" rarely works. Teach your children how to interact safely with people they "meet" online. Though it's preferable they make no in-person contact with online-only acquaintances, young people may not always follow this rule. So talk about maximizing safe conditions: meeting only in well-lit public places, always taking at least one friend, and telling a trusted adult about any plans they make - including the time, place, and acquaintance's contact information (at least a name and cell phone number).</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">Remind them to limit sharing personal information with new friends. Empower your children to handle problems , such as bullying, unwanted contact, or hurtful comments. Work with them on strategies for when problems arise, such as talking to a trusted adult, not retaliating, calmly talking with the person, blocking the person, or filing a complaint. Agree on steps to take if the strategy fails. Encourage your children to be "digital leaders." Help ensure they master the safety and security techniques of all technology they use. Support their positive and safe engagement in online communities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="166">Encourage them to help others accomplish their goals. Urge them to help if friends are making poor choices or being harmed. Content developed collaboratively by NCSA's K-12 Working Group. Additional ways to keep your children safer and more secure online: Keep your home computer in a central and open location so you can physically monitor your children while they are online. Be aware of all the ways young people connect to the Internet : Young people have many options to connect to the Internet beyond a home computer. Phones, gaming systems and even TV's have become connected.</paragraph><paragraph parID="167">Be aware of all the ways and devices (including what they do at friend's houses) your children are using and be sure they know how to use them safely and responsibly. Talk to other parents: When and how you decide to let your children use the Internet is a personal parenting decision. Knowing what other parents are thinking and allowing their children to do is important and can be helpful for making decisions about what your children do online. Know the rules: Not all online services are for kids. Keep informed:   The online world is ever changing. Knowing about them and how young people use them can help you better understand the digital life your children experience as well as any concerns you may have for your children. Most operating systems (including Windows 7, Vista, Mac OS X and Unix) allow you to create a different account for each user.</paragraph><paragraph parID="168">Separate accounts can lessen the chance that your child might accidentally access, modify, change settings and/or delete your files. You can set up certain privileges (the things that can and can't be done) for each account. If you know of a child in immediate risk or danger, call law enforcement right away . Report instances of online child exploitation to the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children's Cyber Tipline. Reports may be made 24-hours a day, 7 days per week at www.cybertipline.com or by calling 1-800-843-5678. Even some of the most popular social networking services and other sites are meant to only for use by people 13 and older. There are many terrific sites designed specifically for younger children that provide a safer, more secure and age-appropriate environment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">New services with great features continually emerge. Consider separate accounts on your computer. From WikiParenting As a parent, our primary fear is for the safety of our children. In recent times, we've had to become more aware of safety than ever before. Our parents and grandparents had the honour of living in times where they didn't have to lock the door - in today's world; we can't even turn our backs. We all worry about how to protect our children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">We worry about whether we are being over protective and whether we are creating a 'cotton wool child'. On the other hand, we can't afford to be too complacent. To a child, a stranger is rarely considered to be an elderly man wandering down the street, or the man searching for his lost puppy. To many children, a stranger is a man who wears dark glasses, is unshaven, wears dirty clothes, has exposed tattoos and scars. It is vital when educating your child about strangers that we bust these myths. When explaining the concept of strangers to your child you need to be specific i.e. someone Mummy hasn't introduced you to. It would also be favourable to show your child pictures of people from differing age groups to demonstrate that anybody can be classed as a stranger.</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">Combine this of photos of familiar people, making sure to point out that this person is not a stranger. For example "Tommy, this photo is of Grandpa - he is not a stranger. This is the newspaper man - he is a stranger." When explaining the concept of Stranger Danger to your child, try to refrain from teaching your child that only strangers bring harm to them. As frightening as the idea is, family members, relatives or family friends can also abuse or harm a child. It is therefore vitally important to not teach your child that only a stranger will hurt or abuse them - that this can happen from other people too. This concept often confuses children who are abused by family members, as they feel this is acceptable behaviour.</paragraph><paragraph parID="172">This is also known as Protective Behaviours. Educating your child on spotting strangers is only the first part. One of the best methods to protect your child is to use a private code word. Teach your child that this word will be given to them if someone other than their regular guardian needs to pick them up from school/care. For example, the word may be the name of a dog or favourite toy. Teach your child that if anyone tries to pick them up or take them away, that they must mention this particular word - then they know it is safe and that Mummy or Daddy know about this. By creating a proper perspective and context for news and current events programs, we can help kids develop the critical thinking skills they need to understand news stories and the news industry.</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">Here are some tips for helping children to understand and cope with the news. Discuss frightening and disturbing news events with children. Don't assume they haven't heard about a disturbing news event - ask first and, if they have, discuss it. Talking honestly and reassuringly to kids about traumatic events will go a long way in assuaging their fears. Reassure children by giving them the facts. For example, explain that terrorist threats are very real in certain places, but not in their community. Understand what news frightens children at different ages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">School-age children are beginning to distinguish fantasy from reality and to worry about real-life dangers. Help them to develop a realistic sense of danger by explaining that traumatic events such as fires, fatal car accidents or plane crashes are rare, which is why they're considered newsworthy. As children get older, the closer an incident is to the reality of their lives, the more disturbing it will be to them. For example, a story about a high-school shooting may be more disturbing to a teenager than a younger child. Encourage older children to watch the news and discuss current events with you. It's important that young people understand what is going on in the world and their community. Watch the news with older children and use it as a springboard to discuss difficult topics such as racism, sexuality, AIDS, war, death, drug and alcohol use.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">Create "teachable moments." Keep a globe or atlas handy when watching the news to look up countries or areas mentioned in stories. Because news items often lack context or thoughtful analysis, use an encyclopedia or the Internet to get more in-depth information about an issue or a country that kids show interest in. Try to find positive news stories. Call attention to stories that emphasize positive actions and people making a difference - stories about new medical research, peace accords, activism on social or environmental issues and exceptional achievements in sports, the arts or sciences. Explain the business of news. News media provide a valuable public service but they are also businesses that, in most cases, depend on advertising revenues to support them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="176">In the search for images and stories that will attract audiences, the news media tend to focus on either sensational crimes, tragedies and disasters or "soft" news, such as entertainment and lifestyle features. Discuss bias and stereotyping in the news. Although most journalists try to be objective and factual in reporting events, there is no such thing as a news story without a point of view. Bias can be unintentional or deliberate, depending on the motives of news gatherers, the sources of information they rely on and the political leanings of the media outlet's owner. As well, reporters often work under tight deadlines and may not have time to present several sides of an issue.

Generation "I" and the Virtual Classroom   Meeting real-world needs with Virtual Classroom projects   By Alicia M. Thomas HPR*TEC hy all the fuss about project-based learning, service-learning, and teachers as facilitators these days? Learners seem to genuinely like it! Recently, we spoke with Illinois students, ages 11-14, who have spent the last year or more steeped in collaborative, technology-based learning. The kids -- Pete, Brittany, Dennis, Frank, Elena, Dan, Alex, Trenton, Katie, and Adam -- are learning to research and present topics online with astounding results, and they just happen to be having a fabulous time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">They are participants in a course called the "Virtual Classroom," which began as a school's answer to an international technology competition. Their work last year landed a handful of these same students in Hong Kong as grand-prize winners! The competition has come and gone due to lack of funding, but the kids are already hooked on a class that exceeded all of their expectations. According to 13-year-old Frank, "This class is loads of fun and anybody who would think that this could not be fun -- there has got to be something wrong with them!" n the Virtual Classroom, project ideas come from the real-world Web site needs of Illinois and District 97. Students decide what projects to undertake, and with facilitation from veteran teacher Janet Barnstable, they brainstorm, troubleshoot, and create solutions together. A no-nonsense book with a strong safety message for young children about how they should avoid potentially dangerous situations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">The narrative throughout is in simple straightforward language, which is undramatic and reassuring whilst stressing dangers. After a thump-bumping ride on a slide, a little girl and her dragon friend find themselves inside a fairy-tale book. The stories are familiar, and there's lots of silly fun as the Dragon is transformed into fairy-tale characters. But danger lurks in the form of strangers -- including the hungry wolf from Little Red Riding Hood and Snow White's evil stepmother. And it's up to the girl to keep an eye on the dragon, who walks alone through deep dark woods and takes treats from people he doesn't know. Internet safety is fast becoming a common household term. So much about being Safe online is not much different from being safe at the local mall.</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">Don&#65533;t talk to strangers, don&#65533;t give people your name and address, Don&#65533;t use vulgar language, don&#65533;t be rude and obnoxious, mind your manners, and don&#65533;t run off with people you don&#65533;t know. This all sounds so easy, then why is it such a problem? Many kids, when online, seem to forget all the rules they where ever taught. They feel somewhat invincible and free to say what they want and to whom they want. Kids can become someone else online, the cool kid, the provocative kid, the mean kid, and post pictures of them selves to prove they are this fantasy person. The more they talk online the more at ease they feel, the more comfortable they get in their new online world. In this world they are in control, not their parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="182">Unfortunately, most parents are not in control when it comes to Internet usage in their Home. Our kids generally have more experience with computers and are very comfortable with them, while most parents are still trying to figure out How to program the VCR our kids are downloading music and creating their own web sites. Internet safety is very important, and it is time for parents to start realizing it. No, not everyone is in eminent danger or will be approached by a sex offender online. But I guarantee you your teen will be inundated with filth that you would not approve of. Putting the dangers aside for a minute, the first Thing you will notice about these online sites is that the language these kids are using is bad, very bad . So many of these sites use very vulgar and Inappropriate language.</paragraph><paragraph parID="183">How will your kids handle that? Will they be strong enough to remove these kids from their top 8? Maybe it&#65533;s time you create Your own profile, many parents do, just to monitor your kids and more importantly monitor their friends. You can learn a lot about your kid by reading their blogs. I guess the point I am trying to make is that Internet safety encompasses more than &#65533;Protecting their personal safety&#65533;. It encompasses their attitudes online, the way they behave, the language they use, the type of friends they attract and &#65533;hang with&#65533; online. Are they sticking to the values you Teach them?</paragraph><paragraph parID="184">Are they enticing the opposite sex with inappropriate language? Are they having conversations with strangers, what type of pictures Have they posted of themselves, what type of pictures have their friends posted? Who is contacting them? This can go on and on but hopefully Parents will start understanding how important it is to monitor what there kids do, where they go, and what they say online. Sounds strict, to invasive? I tell you what, create an account on myspace. Then do a search for the local schools in your area.</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">Check out some of the sites their. I will guarantee you that you will be shocked by what these kids are saying and doing. No, not all of the sites will be bad, but I bet you will find that 50% or more of the sites you come across will have filthy language andor inappropriate pictures. Your kids will come across these sites also, is this ok with you? are they prepared to deal with it? have you talked with them about what to do when they come across inappropriate material? Are they aware of the dangers -Are you?</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">MySpace is the most popular site for teenagers to hang out on the Internet. Kids use MySpace primarily to connect with other kids. They post information about themselves, place their picture on MySpace for others to see, invite other people to become their &#65533;friends&#65533; and spend a lot of time chatting with others and viewing the profiles of other users. Sometimes, they meet people in person through contacts they make in MySpace. Unfortunately, the information they post about themselves is readily available to almost anyone else using MySpace, and that includes millions of adults of all ages, thousands of whom are sexual predators trying to prey on young people. Spector Pro records your child&#65533;s MySpace activity so you will know exactly what he/she is doing while on MySpace. You will see when they update their profile, post pictures, make comments about other MySpace users, send messages to other MySpace users, invite someone to be a friend, accept an invitation from a new friend, and much more.</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">You will also be able to see whether they have created multiple MySpace accounts. You can also view the profiles of people who are contacting your child. So, you&#65533;ll know if your 13 year old is communicating with a 40 year old who has posted inappropriate pictures of himself or talks about using drugs on his profile page. Anything your child does on MySpace, Spector Pro will record and you will be able to review. It's a great way to connect, but online social networking. is also a portal for criminals to get to you and your children. It happened recently in Beaufort County where a mother discovered her 12-year-old daughter was having sexual conversations on Facebook with a 21-year-old man.</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">Thanks to her report to police, the man was arrested in Colorado and charged with attempted child sexual assault, but these predators aren't always caught. "He kind of formed an online dating relationship where they chatted a lot and he eventually led in with the pictures." Cpl. Webb is talking about a man's Facebook conversation with an 11-year-old Pitt County girl. He was able to talk the girl into sending him graphic, nude photos. "We also found out he was not the age he said he was. He appeared to be a tween type age and we found out he was actually in his 40s." Investigators also found out the man lived in India, and even though local police and deputies have made hundreds of arrests for internet crimes- they were powerless in this case where it appears the man's actions are not considered a crime in his country.</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">"We don't have any power in a foreign nation and it's tough enough working state to state on cases," said Webb. "You're not just opening your kid up to the people that live in Pitt County which is still 180,000 people. The girl victim in the case is not on Facebook anymore, but millions of children are. Facebook terms of service require members to be at least 13 years old to set up an account. Additional lockdown that will continue to keep what Kinsley sees online- innocent, and possibly save her from a tragic situation. Otherwise, it's community college all the way for my kids, and you can bet they'll both have jobs to help pay for that. But, I DO monitor their online activities closely.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">So, if my kids not being allowed to post inane drivel and continuous updates on their daily lives 24/7 is somehow a "disadvantage", so be it. I've at least done my part to keep them focused on what's really important, and closed a loophole for child predators as well.

Internet Safety for Educators Course This online course examines many of the dangers that arise regarding the safe use of Internet and computer technologies in educational settings. Prevent Child Abuse Utah - Internet Safety &amp; Child Abduction Prevention Program Prevent Child Abuse Utah offers free training to students on Internet safety and child abduction prevention. NetSmartz This Web site, from The National Center for Missing &amp;amp; Exploited Children and Boys &amp;amp; Girls Clubs of America, provides information about NetSmartz, an interactive, educational safety resource that teaches kids and teens how to stay safer on the Internet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">Stay Safe Online - National Cyber Security Alliance The National Cyber Security Alliance's mission is to educate and therefore empower a digital society to use the Internet safely and securely at home, work, and school, protecting the technology individuals' use, the networks they connect to, and our shared digital assets. Creating a Safe Online Profile (Activity) Developed by ReadWriteThink In this activity from ReadWriteThink, teenagers explore online names by looking at sample e-mail addresses to determine what they can tell about the person who uses the account. We outline the risks and dangers to kids, discuss important terms and technologies and present viable solutions so that both students and educators can use the Internet and their computers safely. The site has many resources for kids, teens, parents, educators, and law enforcement officials, including the video Tracking Teresa.

While we do directly address online safety and security issues, we do so with a clear focus on the broader educational objective. Naming in a Digital World: Creating a Safe Persona on the Internet (Lesson Plan) Developed by ReadWriteThink Naming takes on new meanings in digital settings. As students build personas through e-mail addresses, screen names, and online profiles, they can be unaware of the ways that others may use the aliases, names, and other information that they choose and share. In this lesson from ReadWriteThink, students explore naming conventions in digital and non-digital settings. Then they choose and explain names and profiles to represent themselves online. After this exploration, teens choose a screen name or e-mail address for themselves, as well as decide on personal details to include on a safe, online profile.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">Skills for Life Online Free curriculum for teaching online life skills in K-12 classrooms put together by iLOOKBOTHWAYS. Faceless Dangers...Is MySpace the New Boogie Man? Why are parents so freaked out about the life on teens on the most popular friendship and networking site of 2006, MySpace ? Most people over 30 hadn't even heard of it until six months ago, maybe . MySpace relies on its users volunteering personal information and photos of themselves  and posting them on the Web for all to see ,  celebrating the interests of individuals beyond work and school. Personas are created in the online communities. As Yves Duel said last week in Le Monde , "ce nouveau type de relations sociales, qui permet des allers et retours entre la vie reelle et la vie virtuelle...." (translated: this new type of social relation that permits coming and going between real and virtual life).</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">A Knight-Ridder story   warns about the new platform giving "teens a global stage on which to embarrass themselves and abuse their peers." MySpace.com and the smaller Xanga, Facebook, Friendster, and LiveJournal have exploded. MySpace  - more than 90 percent between age 14 and 30 - is adding members at the rate of 150,000 each day. Forget about warning kids about the perils of "cruising Main Street." NBC's Dateline fanned the flames with a spooky series, Why parents must mind MySpace . Stories include:  molesters and murders , the site being called a " den of evil,"   and Playboy's current feature "The Girls of MySpace" promoting new girls every day and sexy Internet hookup tales. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought MySpace last year for $580 million in cash.</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">Started just over two years ago, 1/4 of its registered users are minors. Murdoch is planning to expand MySpace internationally and on wireless devices and adding video sharing, becoming more like a Web portal. It is a great place for aspiring musicians to expose new audiences to their music. MySpace has its own recording lable. It is an easy networking tool. Probably the most important thing is that in a structured-play age, it is the one place where kids don't have parents hovering. At least not yet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">It is being called the great MySpace crackdown of '06 and stories are hitting the front pages. Do we just need something else to be anxious about? Is it just the Big, Bad Boogie Bear of the moment? MySpace is one of the hottest online sites, beating e-Bay, Google and Amazon.com in the number of page views in December, according to USA Today . It now ranks 13th among all sites, according to Nielsen//NetRatings. ComScore Media Metrix places it fourth by total page views, two notches above Google and has 50 million members . Virtual communities are places to create faces, spaces and places; a very postmodern and fluid construct.</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">Here's a great chat about the hubub, mostly by those most familiar with MySpace, in response to the Dateline furor. A MySpace Cheat Sheet for Parents might help to calm the furor. Some of these things do cause anxiety because we hear or experience the stories as parents and then have to figure out the answers or how to guide our children through these issues. Maybe a child wants to document feelings online and regrets it afterwards when feelings change...The boundaries between public and private are not understood? My daughter had no idea until I talked to her about how permanent the record can be compared to the transient nature of her feelings, which can change overnight. She didn't understand the "cacheing" (am I spelling this right?) nature of these sites.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">Will she regret something years later, like Paris Hilton now regrets (or maybe not) leaving her diaries in a storage unit where the bill forgot to be paid and legally the diary is no longer in her hands/under her ownership? I explained to my daughter that what she writes online is like Paris Hilton's diary. It is potentially open for all to read. So yes, it is important that as parents and adults that we understand these new structures enough to explain the dangers and facts to the NextGen.

Encourage your children to tell you if something or someone online makes them feel uncomfortable or threatened. Ages 15 to 18</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">Teens have almost limitless access to the internet. They are experienced with the internet but they still need parents to remind them of appropriate safety guidelines. Parents should be able to help their teens understand inappropriate activity and how to avoid unsafe situations that could occur. It's a good idea for parents to remind teens what personal information should not be given over the internet. Here are some safety tips to consider as you guide your teens online: Continue to keep communication as open and positive about computers and the web as you can. Keep talking about online lives, friends, and activities, just as you would about other friends and activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">Encourage your teens to tell you if something or someone online makes them feel uncomfortable or threatened. Create a list of internet house rules as a family. Include the kinds of sites that are off limits, internet hours, what information should not be shared online. Help protect your teens from offensive pop-up windows by using the pop-up blocker that's built-in common web browsers. Know which websites your teens visit and to whom they talk with online. Make sure they use monitored chat rooms and stay only in public chat room areas. They should never agree to meet an online friend.</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">Teach your kids not to download programs, music, or files without your permission. File-sharing and taking text, images, or artwork from the web may infringe on copyright laws. Talk to your teenagers about online adult content and pornography. Help protect them from spam. Tell your teens not to respond to junk mail and to use e-mail filters. Make sure your kids are not posting personal information on the web. Be aware of the photos that teens post online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">Discuss online gambling and with your teens. It is illegal for them to gamble online. Help your kids use social networking safely Your kids may use social networking sites designed for children such as Webkinz or Club Penguin, or sites designed for adults such as YouTube, MySpace, Flickr, Twitter, Facebook, and others. Kids can use social networks to connect with people who might live halfway around the world or with kids they see every day at school. Kids should understand that social networking sites can be viewed by anyone with access to the internet. As a result, some of the information they post can make them vulnerable to phishing scams and internet predators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">Communicate with your kids about their experiences. Encourage them to tell you if something or someone they come across on the internet makes them feel anxious, uncomfortable, or threatened. Establish internet rules. These rules should decide whether your children can use social networking sites and how they can use them. The recommended age to sign up for social websites is usually 13. If your child is under the recommended age, you should not let him or her use the site. You cannot rely on social networking sites to keep your underage child from signing up.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">Educate yourself. Checkout the sites that your child plans to use and make sure you both understand the privacy policy and the code of conduct. Find out if the site monitors content that people post and always periodically review your child's page. Teach your children they should never meet anyone in person that they've only communicated with online. Kids could be in real danger if they ever meet strangers they've only communicated with online. It might not be enough to simply tell your chilren not to talk to strangers, because they might not consider someone they've "met" online to be a stranger. Encourage your children to communicate with people they already know.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">You can help protect your children by encouraging them to use these sites to communicate with friends and family, not with people they've never met in person. Ensure your kids don't use full names. Teach them to use only a first name or nickname. Do not allow your children to post the full names of their friends or family. Many social websites allow kids to join public groups that include everyone who goes to a certain school or is on a certain ball team. Be careful when your children reveal information that can identify them, such as a school or the name of the town they live in. Consider using a site that is not very public.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">Be smart about details in photographs. Explain to your children that pictures can reveal a lot of information. Encourage your children not to post pictures of themselves or their friends with clear identifiable details such as street signs, license plates, or their school name. Warn your child about expressing emotions to strangers. Kids use social websites to write journals, poems or blogs that express strong emotions. Explain to your children that anyone with access to the internet can read their site and that predators often search out emotionally vulnerable kids. Remove your child's page if he or she refuses to follow the rules you've set to help protect their safety.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">You can contact the social web site your kid uses and ask them to remove the page. Ages 11 to 14 Here are several ways to help keep your kids safe when using social networking sites. As soon as your children can use the internet on their own, establish rules for internet use. Ensure your kids follow age limits. Be wary of identifiable information in your child's profile. Too much information can make your kids vulnerable to internet predators, internet fraud, or identity theft.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">Some websites allow you to password-protect your site or use other methods to help limit viewers to only people your child knows.

The idea is for parents to be on top of potential online dangers that are very real and to be able to avoid bad situations before they can even happen. We all want to give our kids the benefit of the doubt. We've imparted good values, set boundaries, and done our best to raise them. However, sometimes they might choose friends that we wouldn't approve of, friends that cause trouble either in school, at home, or with other kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">Worse yet, they might influence your child to lean in that direction as well. So you set boundaries and tell your son or daughter that you don't want them to socialize with that person. You can't watch over them while they are in school, so you sure do hope that they obey your words which are in their best interest. Now we know that technology has made some things better for us, but it's made some things worse too. It has made it easier for kids to stay in touch with anyone they want, even those kids you would rather they stay away from. They can text, email, or instant message anyone while you are just a few feet away, completely unaware. In that regard, technology can undermine your requests for your child to avoid socializing with the not so wholesome kid or group of kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">You have a right to know what is going on in your kid's life. The risks of not knowing are just too high. They probably aren't going to tell you everything, but there could be things you need to be aware of to keep them on the right track. Not to be an alarmist, but there some realities to be dealt with. Kids seem to spend more time online more than ever before. Facebook and YouTube present possibilities for rumors to get out of control wreaking havoc in a kid's life. Some chat rooms and bulletin boards have a reputation for exploiting kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">Bottom line statistics are: 86% of children chat online without their parents' knowledge. 64% of teens do things they don't want their parents to know about. 50% of teens communicate online with someone they have never met. 30% of teenage girls are sexually solicited inside a chat room. 58% of parents monitor what their child does in online chat rooms. Guess what? Technology is on our side as well.</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">There is software designed to record emails, reveal websites visited, and provide you with screen shots of their online activity. This might seem invasive, but if you have a hunch that your child is hanging out with a bad crowd behind your back, taking a passive approach can yield some unfortunate consequences. This software that I'm talking about runs undetected and can email you the results to another computer or the one you use while you're at work. You can at least have the peace of mind that you know what you need to know. This type of online reporting software is useful for younger teenagers as well because it will protect them from online predators. What if your child unknowingly has a conversation with an online predator and got convinced to meet face to face? It's a nightmare you don't want to consider.</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">There have been news stories about this very scenario, where kids have gone missing and police find the chat on the computer. But monitoring programs would send you an email of the whole chat immediately after it happens. You avoid the worst and simply block that site forever. The monitoring programs I am referring to are very user friendly and are compatible with just about all internet service providers, even AOL. It's our job and commitment to keep them safe, loved, and protected from harmful situations that just don't need to happen. In the bio box there's a link that explains the specifics about how this type of technology can keep you in the know. &lt;script language='JavaScript' type='text/javascript'&gt; &lt;!-- document.write ("&lt;nolayer&gt;"); document.write ("&lt;a href='http://www.alumbo.com/ads/adclick.php?n=a023f4ba' target='_top'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.alumbo.com/ads/adview.php?what=zone:4&amp;amp;n=a023f4ba' border='0' alt=''&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"); document.write ("&lt;/nolayer&gt;"); document.write ("&lt;ilayer id='layera023f4ba' visibility='hidden' width='180' height='150'&gt;&lt;/ilayer&gt;"); //--&gt; &lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.alumbo.com/ads/adclick.php?n=a023f4ba' target='_top'&gt;&lt;img src='http://www.alumbo.com/ads/adview.php?what=zone:4&amp;amp;n=a023f4ba' border='0' alt=''&gt;</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">In the end, you get to know for sure about what is going on in your child's life even if they don't want to tell you. The students produced a Tobacco-Free site this year. Trenton explains: "The Tobacco-Free site was actually requested from us from ITSC [Illinois Student Technology Conference], so it was actually their idea that we just took up and decided to follow through on." Adam adds: "We've been trying to ... just make something that people can look at to learn about the dangers of smoking and try to have fun with it too, and not try to make it really serious and boring, but try to make it interesting to read about." They succeeded. n addition to the research on tobacco products, the students gathered personal testimonies in interviews about the choice to use or avoid tobacco. "We did a lot of interviews," says Elena, "especially with family members and friends that we could interview easily."</paragraph><paragraph parID="220">Pete adds: "We also interviewed two teachers through e-mail." "They had some pretty tragic stories; it was a learning experience for all of us," says Dennis. The research had an impact. "I have family members that smoke, so I always knew it was pretty horrible, but I read some of the statistics and smoking is pretty gnarly actually. I never knew about some of that stuff, like how many people it's killed and everything." Brittany agrees. "I never want to smoke and I never wanted to smoke before I did the Web site.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">I just know a lot more about it, like other ways it can harm you besides diseases and cancer." These sentiments resonate with her classmate, Frank. "I never really thought it was very smart anyway to smoke, but after we were done with the Tobacco Free site, it was like: 'Wow this is probably dumber than I actually thought, '" says Frank. Hopefully, that's the message other visitors to the site will get too. "We've been trying to ... just make something that people can look at to learn about the dangers of smoking and try to have fun with it too, and not try to make it really serious and boring ... " nother project in progress is their Online Multicultural Center. Katie explains: "We have a multicultural center ... in District 97 ... in two years it will be at Julian [Middle School] in our building.</paragraph><paragraph parID="222">... The center is in one of the elementary schools in our district right now." To share the center's artifacts and resources with other schools, the Virtual Classroom students have created an online presence with much of the center's content. The students take pictures of artifacts and research their origin and use. "We keep getting more and more artifacts," says Adam, "... so you just keep adding on ... [the site] just keeps getting bigger and bigger!" To present the artifacts online, he says, "most of us ended up doing things like taking pictures and turning them into a turntable." They achieve the "turntable" effect by taking multiple shots and sewing them together in a QuickTime Virtual Reality (QTVR) frame. Students of Julian Middle School's "Virtual Classroom" team.</paragraph><paragraph parID="223">atie says they also, "wrote about the object that [they] took pictures of." Given the enormity of the site, such research and writing is impressive. The multicultural site currently covers only a portion of the global artifacts available to District 97 kids, and the Julian kids hope that students who follow them will continue with artifacts from other continents. Elena describes one of her roles in the creation of the site: "I did some text for Africa and for Latin America. Students during a teleconference with us! They were mostly from fairy tales and famous kids' stories, and we kind of had to make the story by animating it." What does it take to put together such entertaining and educational projects?</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">According to the students, there are a variety of tasks, from research, writing, proofing, and Web design, to videography, JavaScript programming, musical composition, and animation production using Flash and Swish. Adam remembers some of their tools: "This year mainly we've been learning a lot of Flash and a lot of HTML. ince so many of the programs were new to the students, Frank says, "We learned by reading the tutorials and going through and doing it -- fooling around with it and pushing buttons -- and eventually you get it to do what you want it to do." Trenton adds his advice for future students: "If they are trying to figure our how to learn something, a lot of it is on the Net; so if you really want to learn, you can probably just search for it. There are many different packages of internet protection software and a variety of options to choose from. I will not endorse a specific product but I will provide advice on how to find software and make an informed decision on the package most suited to your needs. I will also provide a list of some important features to look for and give a short description of the purpose and function of each feature.</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">With this information, you will be able to find internet protection software that best suits the needs of your family. Finding the Right Software A few simple searches on your search engine will provide you with an ample list of internet protection software products and comparable features. I recommend searching the terms in the list below and looking at several of the products before deciding which one to buy. Search the following terms on your search engine to find internet protection software: Family Internet Safety Software Internet Safety Software Child Internet Safety Software Filtering Software Blocking Software Monitoring Software Features of Internet Protection Software As you search for the most suitable internet protection software for your family, you should look for software that has as many of the following useful features as possible: Content Blocking Blocks websites or pages that contain a specific type of content (ie. pornography, violence, hate, etc)</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">Website Blocking Blocks websites or pages within websites (in some cases sites can be specified by user) "Bad List" Filtering Restricts entire websites by a "bad list" of websites Keyword Filtering Restricts web pages by keywords in a specific web page Website Filtering</paragraph><paragraph parID="227">Restricts entire websites by keywords on the site. Email Alerts Sends notification by e-mail to user when restrictions are activated or rule violations are attempted Realtime Monitoring Allows user to see what the protection software is doing when it happens, rather than as a report available after the fact Remote Monitoring Allows user to view information gathered by protection software from a different computer than the one being monitored</paragraph><paragraph parID="228">User Profiles Allows user to customize settings for different children to allow specific levels of protection as needed.

The internet is a remarkable resource for information and entertainment that parents and children can both enjoy. Although it is not possible to guarantee that children will not be exposed to some risk on the internet, it is possible to substantially reduce dangers through parent involvement, software protection, and communication as a family. It may be necessary to contact additional agencies and additional research may be required to fulfil reporting needs required for your specific situation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="230">By working together with children, parents can maintain a safer environment on the internet that allows kids to enjoy the benefits of this tremendous resource.

There is no single magic solution that will protect every child effectively. To provide an environment that allows children to use the internet safely and reap the vast benefits that are available, it is essential to know  what tools are available and how to apply them to unique family situations. It is important to note that there is no perfect solution that will provide children with complete protection from every risk of the internet. Parents can however make surfing the internet safer for kids by being involved with their internet experiences, using protective software, and teaching kids what to do when a dangerous situation arises. Be Involved The most important tool that can be used to protect children from internet dangers is parent involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">Although technological tools and automated measures can be taken to reduce internet risks, there is no tool that will help children to face internet dangers more effectively than parent involvement. The following are some tips on how parents can help children to be safer on the internet: Internet Saftey Rules and Tips for Parents Safety Comes First Parents should always consider safety first when allowing children to use the internet. Surfing with the Kids Parents can surf the internet with their children and become familiar with sites they enjoy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">Share an Account Parents can share an e-mail account with their child and maintain access to that account. By doing this parents can help their child to learn the proper way to use an e-mail account while also keeping an eye out for suspicious and potentially dangerous communications. The Internet is NOT Private Parents should explain to their children that communications they make on the internet are not private and are treated similarly to conversations made in public. Parents should help their children to feel comfortable talking to them about how they use the internet and experiences they have while online. Parents should refrain from being judgmental about what they share and focus on issues that pertain to their safety.</paragraph><paragraph parID="234">Be an Informed Parent In some cases parents do not understand computers or matters pertaining to the internet as well as their children do. When this is the case, parents should study the areas of concern to have an adequate understanding of computer and internet function to make informed decisions on how to protect their children. Parents need to be aware of what their children are involved with, how it works, and what the risks are. Parents should set rules with their children about how they will behave while using the internet and what they will do if dangerous situations are encountered. Never Reveal Private Information Parents should explain to children that they must never reveal private information about themselves such as passwords, real names, location where they live, where they go to school, or places they visit.</paragraph><paragraph parID="235">Children should never give information that can give a stranger the ability to call them or visit them without parental permission. Additionally if children do meet friends on the internet and would like to meet them, they should only do so with a parent to accompany them (never alone). Keep the Computer in an OPEN area Parents should keep the computer that their child uses in a common and visible area of the house (such as a family room). Children should not be allowed to hide behind doors for the duration of their online sessions. Additionally set rules about mobile phones and other electronic devices that have portable internet access. Keep Track of Sites and Passwords</paragraph><paragraph parID="236">Parents should write down their children's most commonly accessed web sites and be aware of what happens on them. Additionally parents should maintain any passwords that apply to these sites, so they can monitor their use and access the sites if any risks are identified. Use "Screen Names" not Real Names Parents should be sure that their children use AKA names or "screen names" for any sites on which they engage in communication. They should also be certain that their "screen names" and profiles do not reveal any private information about them. Avoid Private Chat Rooms These advancements offer new social and educational opportunities to families, but with them comes additional challenges to parents in protecting their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="237">Keeping kids safe on the web requires parents to use a planned approach that allows them to understand internet risks, to be involved with their children's internet use, and to use tools to reduce risks. In order for parents to protect children on the internet, it is important to understand the nature of risks they may face while online. Although a majority of people using the internet have good intentions, there are some online who use the internet to deceive, humiliate, or threaten others. Exposure to Pornography or Other Offensive Material Unfortunately offensive material and pornography are readily available by many means and locations on the internet. Home computers are an obvious source of internet access that pose risks to children, but they are no longer the only method used to access the internet. Wireless devices such as laptops, mobile phones, and other devices can also be used by children to access the internet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="238">Computers found outside of the home (at residences of friends or acquaintances) are also sources that children may use to get online. It is important to consider every source children may use to access the internet in order to plan how to effectively protect them from online dangers. Parents should discuss internet dangers with their children to inform them about what internet risks are and how they can be affected. Parents should not let children use private chat rooms where their e-mail address may be seen by others. Parents should set daily time limits on their children's internet use. These time limits should be determined by parents based on reasonableness and the prevention of interference with other normal daily activities. Parents should be aware of computers outside of the home and electronic devices in consideration of time limits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="239">It should be made clear to children that the time limits also apply to these other sources of internet access. Parents should explain to their children that they should never send a message online that they would be uncomfortable delivering to someone in person. In reference to "Cyber Bullying," they should never do anything that makes someone else feel uncomfortable, afraid, or humiliated. No Trading Photos Parents should not allow children to trade photos with anyone online or by e-mail. Terminate Innapropriate Communications and Report them if Necessary Parents should explain to children that they should never reply to threatening messages, "Cyber Bullying," requests for personal information, or any other message that makes them feel threatened or uncomfortable.</paragraph><paragraph parID="240">Additionally children should tell parents about any such messages. Finally any threatening or obscene messages should be reported to the internet service provider (ISP) used by the parents and to other agencies as necessary. Don't Be Tricked Into Giving Away Your Phone Number Parents should never let their children call anyone online without their permission because caller ID can be used against them to acquire the victims phone number. People are not Always as They Appear Online Parents should let their children know that not everyone online is who they appear to be. Sometimes children may encounter someone online who may pretend to be someone or something that they are not to deceive children into doing something that may place them at risk.</paragraph><paragraph parID="241">Avoid Discussing Personal or Family Matters Online Parents should inform children that they must get permission before registering for anything online. Family Internet Safety Software In addition to all of the steps above that parents can take, it is wise to install software on your computer that can automatically filter and block internet hazards. There are many programs available that will filter out pornography, hate, violence, and other types of undesirable material, preventing them from being accessible to children. These vary in function and effectiveness and many are customizable to your specific wishes for blocking. These software programs are an excellent way to reduce risks to children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="242">They have the ability to reduce dangers of the internet in communication and internet searching. Family internet safety software is a highly recommended tool to use in reducing risk to children, but it should never be considered as a stand-alone method of protection. Although these programs make significant improvements in internet safety for children, they are not foolproof and they will not prevent every danger that children can be exposed to. The list of reasons to not go camping is long: gas is too expensive, it might rain, the kids might be scared, we don't have a tent/stove/sleeping bags, I got plenty of that in Girls Scouts/the Army/my twenties, we are so busy on weekends, I'd rather do chores around the house etc. Those are all valid, but after extensive field research the Our Kids Nature Team can report that family camping is imminently doable and immensely rewarding. Camping does not have to break the bank or even take up your entire weekend. Your kids will be likely to love it, and even if they don't, well, at least you've given them an experience they will always remember.</paragraph><paragraph parID="243">Here's the Our Kids Five Step Guide to Painless and Fun Family Camping: Stay in the area You don't need to drive two or three hours to the Shenandoah to have an authentic overnight camping experience. The Washington DC area offers a bunch of decent campsites well within commuting distance. Skip the long drive, the expensive gas, and the investment of a whole morning just getting there. Montgomery and Prince George's Counties in Maryland, and Fairfax, Prince William and Loudoun in Virginia all offer county, regional or state parks with overnight camping. Montgomery County gets the award for closest in legal camping sites: a limited number of hike-in sites are available (for Montgomery County residents only) in Glen Echo Park, inside the Beltway. For what it's worth, OK spent their first family camping trip at Little Bennett Campground in Clarksburg, MD.</paragraph><paragraph parID="244">It was a short drive, but we felt like we were away from home and "in the natural element." The campsites have a tent pad, fire ring, picnic table, parking spot and lantern post. Nearby there are restrooms with toilets, sinks and showers. The park has a variety of trails and a small nature center staffed by a friendly naturalist. Just go overnight, at first Building on #1 above, an overnight in the area will let you set up the tent, start a fire, cook with a stove, and sleep in sleeping bags after doing all the Saturday morning stuff &#65533; coffee, the paper, the soccer game, and picking up shirts from the laundry. After a few overnights you'll have figured out what to bring, how to pack and what to do. You'll be ready to do a two or three night camping trip, and can safely plan to go farther away and take time off from work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="245">Start out slow and build the family's outdoor stamina over time. The shoulder seasons are fine Thanks to climate change, even early April is fine for soft, sedentary nomads like us. Sure it was chilly at night during our early April field test, but that is what hot chocolate is for. Our little campers did not complain a bit. OK says April-May and September-October would be fine for family camping, less crowded than the "high season" and less bug-gy. You don't really need to bring alot of stuff. Remember to bring the tent, sleeping bags, stove, fuel, and food and you are well on your way to a successful trip.</paragraph><paragraph parID="246">Print a checklist from any of a hundred sites just to be sure, of course, but those are the basics. There are a bunch of things that you probably don't need to bring, and many of them have batteries. "Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety." Hotspur had it right. There are lots and lots of dangers lurking in the woods, everything from ticks (do check your kids and spouse after walks) to bears (keep food away from the camp in a bear proof container, if in a bear area), poison ivy and nettles (recognize it and avoid it) to snakes (walk loudly and don't reach into logs or rocks blindly) and rabid animals (don't touch wild animals, definitely ones who have no fear of humans). There have been entire books written about camping, the wilderness, and backpacking, so we'll leave all that to the experts and focus on some pointers for families heading into the wilderness, or at least into a tent overnight. Use a decent checklist before you visit StuffMart.</paragraph><paragraph parID="247">Some stuff will be obvious, but other stuff you might not think of until it is too late. We worried that we should have brought balls, frisbees etc. but just being there was fun enough...the time went fast, and the little campers were too busy absorbing the experience to need to go play something they can play at home. Set up the tent at home the weekend before, for practice. Prep your little campers by explaining what you will be doing, and what the camp rules are. One of our interns spent most of last year very concerned about bears (as well as volcanoes) but said not a word about the possibility of a bear encounter when we went out. If your children have fears - strange noises at night, thunderstorms, animals, fire, whatever - then talk them out before you go. Skip the camp sites that feature power hook ups.</paragraph><paragraph parID="248">They are more likely to be noisy, and you are more likely to end up bringing stuff that plugs in. What is the point of camping if you bring all that stuff with you? By all means have a campfire and make s'mores. Note that most camp ground have dry wood for sale, and some prohibit bringing your own because of the possibility of invasive pests. When it is time to get into your sleeping bag, consider reading "A Walk In the Woods" before you doze off. If you are asking yourself "aren't my children better off at home playing computer games or spending quality time with our flat-screen babysitter?" then you probably need to make a change.</paragraph><paragraph parID="249">OK says spend a weekend in the woods with your kids! We went into the wilderness last weekend, and it was everything we thought it would be. We have to teach our children that many people on the Internet have biases &amp; prejudices that clash with our values. It's a good time to explain what your values are &amp; to explain why you believe what you do. A solid grounding like this is your best weapon against others trying to sway your children's opinions. When our children are exposed to outrageous bigotry &amp; hatred online or anywhere else, we can help them understand the dangers of prejudice &amp; the importance of diversity &amp; tolerance. On the Internet, our children travel the world every day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="250">We need to make sure that they understand that they are truly part of the global community, &amp; learn to celebrate the differences &amp; diversity the global community represents rather than mock them. Point out faulty expectations &amp; prejudices with your children by asking them what they think the person they're talking to online is like. Ask them how that changes things-and why. This may be a good way to start to teach them about prejudice &amp; stereotypes. Also, you should discuss hurtful &amp; hateful things when they happen and: teach your children how much discrimination hurts The more they have a chance to talk &amp; share ideas with other children around the world, the more they will learn how alike we all are. Mark Twain put his finger on it when he said: "Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, &amp; narrow-mindedness."</paragraph><paragraph parID="251">Then give them alternative descriptions telling them that the person is fifty, not fifteen, male, not female, &amp; of a different race.

Nowadays we have realized that since the majority of molestations and kidnappings occur by someone the child knows, we don't refer to "stranger danger".</paragraph><paragraph parID="253">Besides, kids have a very specific definition of "stranger". We focus on any person or behavior that "doesn't feel right" and "gut feelings". Then parents can take the appropriate action. Tell your child to NEVER open the home door to ANYONE he doesn't know or if he has a "funny feeling" about what someone wants. He can say, "I'm not allowed. You must go to a neighbor adult or call here on the phone." This applies to any "authority figure" or "professional".</paragraph><paragraph parID="254">I can not tell you how important it is to know the person with your child very well. In that day and age, it was necessary for me to take a bus home. A neighbor stopped and offered me a ride home, but I refused to go with him. He told my parents that I refused his ride, and they were very upset with me. Several years later, the same man picked up another neighbor child, and that child was abused. My "funny feeling" might have drawn my parent's ire, but it kept me safe. They trusted the man because he was a neighbor.</paragraph><paragraph parID="255">You have a job to do as a parent. You WILL be held legally accountable for your child's actions until he or she turns 18. So that means that if your child is entering adults-only websites or striking up online friendships with people who SAY they're the same age as your kid, the only person who can really be held accountable is YOU if something goes wrong. When we allow our children free, unsupervised access to whatever they find on the Internet, aren't we really just dropping them off at a bus stop in the seediest part of town? This is the main reason I advocate keeping all computers in high-traffic areas of the home. Computer use does not belong behind closed bedroom doors. A kitchen or family room is the perfect place, with the monitor angled so that anyone in the room can see what's on the screen, to help kids make good choices about where they travel online.</paragraph><paragraph parID="256">Something parents also need to consider is the online gaming experiences their children are encountering. The content in many online games rivals movies and television shows in terms of how violent, explicit, or unhealthy it is in its messages. Many parents strictly limit television or get rid of it entirely. But they may not realize that their children are engaged in equally objectionable materials in the games they frequent. I will be the first to advocate online environments as potentially positive for young people; I just believe that these are experiences that should be shared with a parent or other responsible family member. We regulate what our children watch at home and in movie theaters; we can do the same with their gaming. An added factor in the area of online gaming is the other players with whom your child may be interacting.</paragraph><paragraph parID="257">Multi-player games can offer many enriching experiences for kids. However, there are predators who only use online games to meet their victims, preying on the chance that such kids may be disaffected and escaping into games to avoid realities in which they don't get what they need. Parents of kids who cross state lines to meet with child predators aren't usually aware of what their children have been doing online. They might feel uncomfortable with technology or they may believe they don't have time for such activities as keeping up with their kids online. However, taking the time to have your child explain his or her online activities - and then limiting the time your child can spend on them - is a worthwhile investment. By setting limits, and using themselves as models, parents can demonstrate how there is more to life than what's online. And this means that there are other demands on one's time that are more important.</paragraph><paragraph parID="258">This is also an opportunity to help kids establish trust within the family dynamic. Setting limits and being nearby is the first step. Then, kids should not need to be supervised at ALL times, as long as what they do is out in the open. When a parent or older sibling passes through on the way to the fridge, he or she can glance over and keep an eye on the overall behavior of the young person at the computer. Quickly hiding something on the screen or switching off the monitor are signs of trouble. Parenting skills can take over from there. Computer and Internet use offers far more positive benefits than it does dangers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="259">Parents can use these tools wisely to raise responsible children who will become adults who make good choices. But we would no more let them loose on the wild, wild Internet than we would let them roam the streets at night. So if parents can be aware of where their kids are going online, they can help them avoid some of the negative consequences of clicking down the wrong path. This is the age at which they are exposed to the greatest dangers, such as meeting pedophiles online, which is also true for Quebec! Fortunately, there are ways to make sure your kids have a safe Internet environment. Make sure your kids don't give out their personal information (or yours) online. This includes name, address, phone number, photos and passwords.</paragraph><paragraph parID="260">Don't give your children your password; that would defeat the purpose of the parental control. Ask them to tell you if they see anything disturbing online or anything happens that bothers them, but don't prevent them from continuing to use the Internet. Limit your children's access to the Internet, especially after school if they are home alone. Make sure there is always an adult around when your children are on the Internet and take an interest in their activities and hobbies. It's a good idea to sit with them and browse the Web together sometimes. Make sure your children treat other Internet users with respect when they go online. Professional help is available to help you with any type of situation you may be experiencing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="261">Starting around age 7, some children begin using the Internet to communicate with their friends. Here are some points to consider and discuss with your children. Don't let your children send or post photos of themselves on the Internet without your permission and don't let them use a webcam without supervision. Discuss the Internet with your kids just as you discuss their day at school, their friends and their other activities. Have an open dialogue. Be non-judgemental in offering information, support and advice. Your children will be safer if they know they can talk to you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="262">Start talking about sexuality and warn them about the sexual content they may find on the Web. Explain that it is for adults only. It is normal for your children to want to use a language and codes that you can't understand (especially in chat rooms). Keep an eye on your telephone and Internet bills to make sure your children are not making transactions accidentally or without your approval. Know their friends and their friends' parents. Warn them about cyberbullying, which is a growing problem He discovered The Adventures of Tintin , a comic book series by the Belgian artist Herg&#233;, in 1981.</paragraph><paragraph parID="263">He loved the art, the story and the tenacious lead character, Tintin. When he first approached Herg&#233; about making it into a movie, Spielberg was unaware of the comic's legions of followers in Europe and of the 150 million books that had been sold since Tintin debuted in 1929. In the film, Tintin buys a model ship, the Unicorn, at a market, only to discover that it harbors a great secret - and that a swarm of dangerous characters will stop at nothing to get it from him. Through the character of Tintin, Spielberg sends a positive message about youth standing up against evil, a theme that has appeared before in Spielberg movies. It emerges in E.T. , where an alienated boy rescues an alien, and it returns in War Horse , where an English farm boy searches through World War I battlefields to bring home his beloved horse. Spielberg's interest in youth empowerment stems from his own childhood. As a skinny kid with glasses, a dyslexic reader and a Jew in gentile neighborhoods, Spielberg was at times a target of bullies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="264">There is an element of danger in the fi lm, however, so it's best for ages 7 and up. As a parent, Spielberg said, he also was "responsible not to put any pott y humor in Tintin and yet, still keep it mature enough, so the kids will not feel that we're talking down to them." Spielberg spent 28 years, off and on, on the project. Due to a change in script, production company and lead actor, movie production didn't begin until the mid-2000s. He and his colleagues then spent five years developing the script and visual style, animating the film and adding effects. Spielberg had more control over Tintin  than any other film, doing more tasks than he usually does, even lighting his own sets. Spielberg put his heart into the animated adventure, and he approaches his role as a father in the same way.</paragraph><paragraph parID="265">When his first son, Max, was born in 1985, Spielberg said his "paradigm changed, and everything from that moment on had to do with my kids' wellbeing, and my career suddenly became second." Now that his children are older, the key to parenting is being a good listener, he said. He tries to be mindful and empathetic, and if any one of his kids tells him, in so many words, that he's spending too much time at the office, "I will always drop everything and go meet those needs. That's the priority." "They always need mom and dad, and I am either there with my kids or my wife [Kate Capshaw] is, but they're never without us." Among the activities he and his kids enjoy doing together are caring for their 12 horses and watching movies. Spielberg's kids have grown up with the work and energy surrounding the production of Tintin and he's shared with them the film's evolution.</paragraph><paragraph parID="266">He recently was able to show them the final cut - "a wonderful reward," he said, for the years that he's devoted to it.

However, a number of high-profile teen suicides have brought the issue of cyberstalking to the fore.</paragraph><paragraph parID="282">When children don't know how to manage their online presence, they may find that others who do are able to do or say mean things about them. Children should learn at an early age how to block content that they don't want to see, how to keep their privacy settings at high levels, and what information and pictures to keep private. Facebook is a big example of this, children want to get Facebook pages because all the older kids are doing it, but they don't know what a Facebook page entails. Thus, it is your responsibility to teach your child that: * Facebook information is public information that anyone in the world can see, unless they make it private. * Just like as they shouldn't spend time with people who make them feel uncomfortable, they also shouldn't "friend" anyone who makes them feel uncomfortable on Facebook. * Their phone number, address and e-mail shouldn't be shared on Facebook.</paragraph><paragraph parID="283">Additionally, children should learn that anything shared online can't be erased, which is important to consider before typing or sharing anything. The major problem, and one we will come back to again and again, is that the Internet feels like a private experience for a child sitting alone at a computer, but information they share is completely public. Therefore, if a child feels uncomfortable about anything he or she has seen on the Internet, your child should tell you immediately. Sexual Predators Every parent's fear is that somehow, a sexual predator is masquerading as a child and making friends with their children with the intent to kidnap. Similarly, if a child meets a friend online and they want to schedule a meeting, one or both parents should go along with the child on the first meeting. At the very least, a child should tell his or her new online friend that their parents will be coming along.</paragraph><paragraph parID="284">A good Web curriculum for kids is vital to their well-being, both from a safety standpoint and from a future jobs standpoint. Explain to older children how others have been denied jobs, positions on sports teams or prestigious awards because of pictures, posts or Web sites they have made on the Internet. Depending on how old your child is, you may chose to give them more Internet privileges as well as more information about the dangers of the Internet. On the other hand, young children should be given strict rules, which can be gradually eased away as they grow older. Ultimately, your will children will be much more effective at policing themselves than you are at policing them, so you need to make it clear that the Internet is more dangerous than it seems. While it is an excellent tool for helping kids do well in school, connect with friends and learn about the world, the Internet is not and should not be a total free-for-all. Unless kids know how to handle the potential perils, they will go through life practicing unsafe behaviors.</paragraph><paragraph parID="285">Just as you teach your children about fire safety, kitchen safety, car safety and sexual safety, Web safety should become an integral part of any child's education in the 21st century.

Due to the fact that identity on the Internet is so fluid, we have no idea what our kids are getting up to when they are online. This is why it is important to teach your children how to defend themselves on the Internet at an early age. Taking the Internet seriously is important for you and your children, and you owe it to them to help them understand how to handle themselves online. Good parents know the importance of instilling a healthy sense of confidence in their children, and well-taught children know not to get involved in fights or verbal spats.</paragraph><paragraph parID="289">This is indeed a serious problem , and young children should be taught not to share any personal information with anyone who is not family. Older children (who may end up sharing information anyway) should be cautioned that there are people in the world who want to hurt them, and to see you as an ally if they find themselves in an uncomfortable situation. If the friend stops contacting the child or expresses a lack of interest, the child should be told to stop contacting this person, as he or she does not have your child's best interests at heart. Read up on Government and News about how to Keep Kids Safe Besides explaining the perils of the Internet to your kids, you should also speak with your child's teachers about whether or not your children are being taught web-savvy skills in school. For instance, if kids post pictures of themselves that they would not want potential employers to see, it could be disastrous in the future.

Keeping Kids Safe Online Links Talk with children about the benefits and risks of the Internet. Ask them what they do online, what websites they visit, who they chat with, and what games they play. When possible, go online with your children. Have them show you their favorite websites, online games, and chat rooms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="293">Go online and look at websites, chat rooms, and blogs that your children might visit. This will help you identify what you think is important to discuss with them. Make a list of any websites you find that you think your children will enjoy and share it with them. Keep the computer in a busy area of the house. With your children, agree on rules of what they can and cannot do online, when they can go on the Internet, and how long they can stay. Have your children sign McGruff's Internet pledge and post it by the computer so they remember how to stay safe online. If your children tell you that they saw something inappropriate online, don't blame or punish them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="294">Remember that how you react will affect what your children share with you in the future. Ask who your children talk to online and how they communicate (i.e. email, instant messenger, chat rooms, blogs, etc.). Tell them that you expect them to be as nice online as they are offline. Make sure they know the dangers of meeting new friends online. Decide if you want to allow your children to purchase items or sign up for online services (e.g., membership to a gaming website) on their own or if they should ask your permission first. Teach children about plagiarism. Explain that if they conduct online research they must give attribution to the author, organization, or website that created the content.</paragraph><paragraph parID="295">Talk with children about downloading music and movies online. If you decide to let your children download files onto your computer, show them legal ways to do so, such as using pay per download or pay per month services like iTunes and Napster. Consider using a filter, blocking, or ratings system for your computer. For more information on Internet Safety, visit iKeepSafe.org to meet McGruff's friend Faux Paw, the Internet safety cat.

Using Our Resources: Family Support Line recommends that all policies or procedures be routinely reviewed by qualified legal representation. Bullies and mean girls have been around forever, but technology has given them a whole new platform for their actions. As adults, we're becoming more aware that the "sticks and stones" adage no longer holds true; both real world and online name-calling can have serious emotional consequences for our kids and teens. It's not always easy to know how and when to step in as a parent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="299">For starters, our kids tend to use technology differently than we do. Kids and teens today start playing games online and sending texts on their cell phones at an early age, and most teens have smart phones that keep them constantly connected to the Internet. Many are logged on to Facebook and chatting or sending text messages all day. Even sending email or leaving a voice mail seems "so old-school" to them. Their knowledge of the digital world can be intimidating, but if parents stay involved in their kids online world, just as you do in their real world, you can help protect your kids from online dangers. Fortunately, our growing awareness of cyberbullying has helped us learn a lot more about how to prevent it. Here are some suggestions on what to do if online bullying has become part of your child's life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="300">What Is Cyberbullying? Cyberbullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. By definition, it occurs among young people. When an adult is involved, it may meet the definition of cyber-harassment or cyber-stalking , a crime that can have legal consequences and involve jail time. Sometimes cyberbullying can be easy to spot - for example, if your child shows you a text message, tweet, or response to a status update on Facebook that is harsh, mean, or cruel. Other acts are less obvious, like impersonating a victim online or posting personal information, photos, or videos designed to hurt or embarrass another person. The impersonal nature of text messages, IMs, and emails make it very hard to detect the sender's tone - one person's joke could be another's hurtful insult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="301">A 2006 poll from the national organization Fight Crime: Invest in Kids found that 1 in 3 teens and 1 in 6 preteens have been the victims of cyberbullying. As long as kids have access to a phone, computer, or other device (such as an iTouch), they are at risk. Severe or chronic cyberbullying can leave victims at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and other stress-related disorders. In some rare but highly publicized cases, some kids have turned to suicide. The punishment for cyberbullies can include being suspended from school or kicked off of sports teams. Certain types of cyberbullying also may violate school codes or even anti-discrimination or sexual harassment laws. Signs of Cyberbullying</paragraph><paragraph parID="302">Many kids and teens who are cyberbullied are reluctant to tell a teacher or parent, often because they feel ashamed of the social stigma, or because they fear their computer privileges will be taken away at home. The signs that a child is being cyberbullied vary, but a few things to look for are: signs of emotional distress during or after using the Internet or the phone If you discover that your child is being cyberbullied, talk to him or her about any experiences you have had in your childhood. This can help your child feel less alone. Let your child know that it's not his or her fault, and that bullying says more about the bully than the victim. Talking to teachers or school administrators also may help, but take cues from your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="303">Many schools, school districts, and after-school clubs have established protocols for responding to cyberbullying; these vary by district and state. But before reporting the problem, let your child know that you plan to do so, as he or she could have concerns about "tattling" and might prefer that the problem be handled privately. Other measures to try: Block the bully. Most devices have settings that allow you to electronically block emails, IMs, or text messages from specific people. Limit access to technology . Although it's hurtful, many kids who are bullied can't resist the temptation to check websites or phones to see if there are new messages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="304">Keep the computer in a public place in the house (no laptops in children's bedrooms, for example) and limit the use of cell phones and games. Some companies allow you to turn off text messaging services during certain hours. And, most websites and phones provide the option for parental controls, which provide parents with access to their children's messages and online life. Know your kids' online world. Check their postings and the sites kids visit, and be aware of how they spend their time online. Talk to them about the importance of privacy and why it's a bad idea to share personal information online, even with friends. Encourage them to safeguard passwords.</paragraph><paragraph parID="305">Write up cell phone and social media contracts that you are willing to enforce. Look to the web for resource and support information about cyberbullying. If your son or daughter agrees, you may also arrange for mediation with a therapist or counselor at school who can work with your child and/or the bully. When Your Child Is the Bully Finding out that your kid is the one who is behaving inappropriately can be upsetting and heartbreaking. It's important to address the problem head on and not wait for it to go away. Talk to your child firmly about his or her actions and explain the negative impact it has on others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="306">Joking and teasing might seem OK, but it can hurt people's feelings and lead to getting in trouble. Bullying - in any form - is unacceptable; there can be serious (and sometimes irrevocable) consequences at home, school, and in the community if it continues. Remind your child that the use of cell phones and computers is a privilege. Sometimes it helps to restrict the use of these devices until behavior improves. If you feel your child should have a cell phone for safety reasons, make sure it is a phone that can only be used for emergency purposes. Insist on strict parental controls on all devices if there is any history of your child making impulsive decisions when they are online. To get to the heart of the matter, sometimes talking to teachers, guidance counselors, and other school officials can help identify situations that lead a kid to bully others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="307">If your child has trouble managing anger, talk to a therapist about helping your son or daughter learn to cope with anger, hurt, frustration, and other strong emotions in a healthy way. Professional counseling often helps kids learn to deal with their feelings and improve their confidence and social skills, which in turn can reduce the risk of bullying. If you're tech-savvy yourself, model good online habits to help your kids understand the benefits and the dangers of life in the digital world. How Parents Can Help These dangers are significantly increased on water courses where there are rapids and/or in adverse weather conditions and/or in remote locations. Many were simply rude, vulgar comments," and "Almost all youth handled unwanted solicitations easily and effectively." Don't lead them on - you don't want to be the target of a predator's grooming.</paragraph><paragraph parID="308">How common and dangerous is cyberbullying? The largest source of bullying (12 percent) was in person, followed by text messaging (9%). Eight percent said they had been bullied via email, a social networking site or instant messaging and 7% were bullied via voice calls on the phone. The impact of cyberbullying can range from inconsequential to extremely severe depending on such factors as the severity or the bullying and the reliance of the person being bullied. An often cited but flawed 2009 study suggested that 20% of youth had engaged in sexting but that study included young adults. More credible studies from the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project and the Crimes Against Children Research Center (CARCC) paint a much less dire picture. The 2011 CARC study found that 2.5% of 12 t0 17 year-0lds had sent a nude or nearly nude picture of themselves and that 1.3% had sent a picture that showed breasts, genitals or "someone's bottom."</paragraph><paragraph parID="309">The CACRC study also found that older teens are far more likely to send a sext than younger kids. More than seven in 10 (72%) of the kids who had sent nude or partially nude images were 16 or 17. The Pew study found that about 2% of teens had sent nude or nearly nude pictures of themselves. About 7% of youth had received a nude or nearly nude image in the past year, but a single image could be sent to multiple kids. It's certainly possible for anything you post on a social networking site to affect your reputation. That's why it's a good idea to avoid posting any picture or comment that you wouldn't feel comfortable sharing with the public now or in the future. How much is "too much" time online?</paragraph><paragraph parID="310">You know what they say about "too much of a good thing." What is the impact of pornography on kids? This issue is fraught with controversy partially because of inconsistencies in the research but also because of moral, social and religious issues that affect people's opinions on this topic. It is also important to distinguish between occasional use of pornography and excessive or obsessive use as well as the types of images being looked it. Images that depict minors, commonly referred to as "child pornography" or "child abuse images" are illegal to create, transmit or posses.' What special risks are associated with Facebook, Google+ or other social networks The risks associated with social networking are based on how you and people you interact with behave on those networks.</paragraph><paragraph parID="311">It's also possible for people to post unflattering or inappropriate photos of other people. This can greatly enhance the enjoyment of the game, leading to camaraderie among teammates or friendly ribbing between opponents. But like any chat tool, it can also be misused. Smart phones can also be used for video chat and as still and video cameras so it's important that kid understand the risk of impulsively taking and sending inappropriate photos and videos. Also, almost all of today's phones are location-aware which means that the phone is able to pinpoint the user's location. There are many apps that can pass on that location information to others so youth need to be cautioned to be very careful about how they use these services and to only share there location with close family and friends and to stop sharing it with anyone who ceases to be a trusted friend. For anyone behind the wheel, the most distracted driving is a serious risk.</paragraph><paragraph parID="312">Never text and drive and be careful when talking on the phone. It's not just a matter of "hands-free," it's also the issue of focus. Don't let your conversation distract you from your driving. The simple answer is to think critically about the information you provide. Should I install Internet filtering or monitoring software There are several ways to get around filters, including using another computer, mobile phone or tablet that's not filtered. Monitoring tools can inform parents of where their kids are going but some kids -especially teens- feel that it's an invasion of their privacy and many would argue that it's not necessary or helpful.</paragraph><paragraph parID="313">The use of these tools are personal decisions that every family needs to put thought into. Ultimately, the only filter that can fully protect your child isn't the one that runs on a computer or a phone but the the one that runs in the computer between their ears. It's important to teach critical thinking skills to help children make good decisions on and off the net now and as they mature. With any luck, your child will grow up and become independent so it's important they they develop their own controls rather than relying on those imposed by parents or schools. Although it can happen, the risk of a child or teen being harmed by someone they met on the Internet is very low. "Most were limited to brief online comments or questions in chat rooms or instant messages. Is there any danger in online games?</paragraph><paragraph parID="314">Some online games - including some played on video game consoles - have a chat feature that allows you to interact ith other player. Children and teens represent a growing number of online users who, like adults, are surfing the Internet, exchanging email, posting and reading messages in newsgroups, and joining conversations in chat rooms. While there are numerous benefits for children to use this technology, there are times when they have and can become targets for crime and exploitation on the Internet. Things to know: Cases of abuse on the Internet, such as kidnappings or molestation that you may have seen in the media, although they are events that occur fairly infrequently, are real and are matters to take seriously. The important thing to keep in mind is that if you take the appropriate safety precautions and pay attention to what your children are doing on the Internet, you can prevent these incidents from happening and allow your child to have a positive Internet-going experience. What to watch out for and prevention strategies: Exposure to Inappropriate Material</paragraph><paragraph parID="315">&#8226; There are no restrictions for what is allowed to be posted on the Internet, and unfortunately children can find ways to access inappropriate material. For example, there are Web sites that allow gambling. In many cases, these sites operate legally in their jurisdiction, but if minors participate, it's no longer legal no matter where they are. &#8226; Prevention: Talk to your children about the things that are and are not appropriate to view on the Internet. In doing this, you can look into downloading software to prevent your children from viewing certain types of material. * Note: This software tends to filter out good content as well, so it's important to read about the software and understand how it works. Harassment</paragraph><paragraph parID="316">&#8226; Children may encounter email, chat content or bulletin board messages that are harassing or demeaning. This risk may not be life threatening, but it could affect a child's self esteem and his or her overall opinions about life. &#8226; Prevention: Talk to your children and establish boundaries for them on the Internet. Where are the places that you would like for them to visit on the Internet? Are there things that you would not like them to do? Remember, it's always better that information comes from you first, and then when they encounter it on the Internet, they will know how to react to it. Legal and Financial Dangers</paragraph><paragraph parID="317">&#8226; There are so many ways to exchange legal or financial information that unfortunately can lead to credit card and/or identity theft, and if adults can get into this kind of trouble, children can too. &#8226; Prevention: Talk to your children about the negative implications that are connected with exchanging financial information on the Internet, and decide how much information about your credit cards or other financial matters that you will give your children. Drugs, Alcohol, Tobacco and other Dangers &#8226; Some Web sites and newsgroups contain information that promotes the use of drugs, tobacco or alcohol. And sometimes, it is possible to find places on the Internet that provide information on how to make bombs or obtain weapons. &#8226; Prevention: Remember, your children can access just about anything on the Internet, and it's important for them to know what you expect of them while doing this. What are your ideas about drugs, tobacco or alcohol?</paragraph><paragraph parID="318">What are your feelings about bombs and weapons? Talk to them. You can't prevent your children from seeing everything on the Internet, but you can help them form an opinion about these things before they encounter them on the Internet, and instill a sense of right and wrong in them so that they can be responsible while they 'surf.' Physical Molestation &#8226; Although not very likely, there is a slight risk that while online, a child might provide information or arrange an encounter that could risk his or her safety or the safety of other family members. In a few cases, pedophiles have used email, bulletin boards and chat areas to gain a child's confidence and then arrange a face-to-face meeting. &#8226; Prevention: Talk to your children and make sure they are aware of the dangers associated with Internet usage.</paragraph><paragraph parID="319">Tell them not to give out personal information such as their name, address, digital photos or information about their after-school or weekend activities. Explain to them that not all people tell the truth about their identity on the Internet and that the people they 'chat' with may not be who they say they are. If you allow them to participate in chat room conversations, warn them to never agree to meet anyone face-to-face without parental consent and involvement. We continually warn them of the dangers that strangers present. Parenting for stranger danger also includes teaching children about talking to right strangers if they get lost and when it is okay to approach a stranger. Last summer we went to a water park. When I came back he was gone.</paragraph><paragraph parID="320">I of course was feeling panicky and started calling and searching for him. A few minutes later I saw him with a water park employee headed for the office. He said that he was wandering around and a lady asked him if he was lost. After that experience I realized that I needed to review how he should approach a stranger if he needed help. You can help your child get comfortable asking strangers for help by practicing in a safe environment. Have your child talk to a stranger while you observe. You might have them ask a stranger what time it is or directions to a place close by.</paragraph><paragraph parID="321">Teach your child that they should find an employee. When you are go different places point out the employees, they typically are in uniform, which your child can recognize. If an employee isn&#65533;t near by then they should approach a mother with kids or a grandpa or grandma. Not only are these people less likely to be a child predator but they are more likely to be willing to help a child who is lost. If your children are a little older set a predetermined spot to meet if your child gets lost. Whenever we went to an amusement park or the mall my parents would tell us to meet at a certain spot if we got separated. The few times that it happened we were glad that we knew what to do.</paragraph><paragraph parID="322">In the modeling world and in everyday life as well children often meet strangers. Because we so often rehearse, the fear of a stranger&#65533;s danger may make your child wary of meeting new people. You can practice with them how to approach people that they don&#65533;t know. Teach them to shake hands and introduce themselves by saying something like, &#65533;Hi, my name is&#65533;&#65533; Explain that it is okay to approach strangers when you are with them. That they don&#65533;t need to be afraid of people that they don&#65533;t know as long as you are there. While parenting about stranger danger , it is also important to teach children about approaching and talking to a stranger when needed.

All they need is access to a parent's credit card that may be stored on the computer.

DOES parental control over a child's use of the Internet prevent the child from being harmed by the potential dangers of social networking?</paragraph><paragraph parID="333">"It's a difficult question, how to make cyberspace safe," said Alex Henry, a lecturer from Universiti Brunei Darussalam. Henry is from the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS) and had taught courses related to professional communication. Henry explained that on the Internet, there are many different ways to contact people. One of them was through free online chatrooms which include "sex chatrooms". "All you need is an email account and if you do sign in all you have to do is verify you're above 18," he added. To verify that someone is over 18, "it's just a click on the button", Henry said. The lecturer added that he does not know what the solution to the problem is, but he supervises his children when they use the Internet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="334">"My kids are all supervised, they do not have access to the Internet without any supervision," Henry said. Ili Abdullah, a 24-year-old former UBD student has an eight-year-old niece and is worried her niece would start using any of the available social networking sites. "The ads on the (social networking) sites are not for kids," Ili said referring to a "go braless" ad seen on Facebook, a popular social networking site. "I think there should be an age limit for social networking sites although that would be hard," Ili said. There are Internet predators who can pretend to be anyone and this can be dangerous especially to children as these "Internet predators can just pretend to be someone their (the children's) age," Ili said. For Ili, the only solution was that parents have to supervise the kids. "They have Internet tools to do that now, Internet history can be checked and so on," Ili said.</paragraph><paragraph parID="335">Lim Shen Quan, a 24-year-old rugby player in Brunei who has a 12-year-old sister who uses Facebook also had concerns. "I spoke to my little sister nicely not to spend too much time on it (Facebook). At times I have to raise my voice and scold her for her own good," Lim said. Lim explained that he was aware of "online predators" and even came across one. Lim added that in Brunei, it did not seem as serious as places outside of Brunei where there were rape cases caused by social networking. Aliaa Hafizah Hj Awang, a 14-year-old student from Sekolah Tinggi Perempuan Raja Isteri (STPRI), an active user of Facebook was aware of "online predators".

Inhalants, often household products such as glue, nail polish, spray paint and marker pens, put kids at particular risk of inhalants abuse. Inhalants which have the potential for abuse are widely accessible, and cause a brief, intense period of intoxication . Research shows that unlike other drugs, inhalant abuse is increasing in kids, although their awareness of the dangers is declining. Parents can take these important steps to protect their kids from inhalants abuse. Read Labels On Everything</paragraph><paragraph parID="337">One of the best ways of keeping yourself informed about the safety of substances entering your home is to get into the habit of reading labels. Any poisonous, flammable, or volatile substance will be clearly marked with a cautionary message. These messages should be taken seriously, and you should consider these substances a risk for inhalants abuse. Educate and Teach Your Children of the Dangers of Inhalants Abuse Despite their accessibility, inhalants abuse puts users at more risk of sudden death than most other groups of drugs. Being aware, and teaching your kids to be aware of this risk is crucial. Unlike most other drugs, inhalants are often in kids' own environments at home and school, so they need to know the dangers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="338">In a matter-of-fact way, explain that inhalants abuse, even once or twice, can kill instantly. Explain the Dangers of Intoxication From Inhalants Symptoms of inhalants intoxication can include mild stimulation, loss of inhibition, distorted perceptions, nausea, vomiting, slurred speech, and loss of coordination. As with other forms of intoxication, this puts them at risk of many harms, including accidents, injuries, and abuse. As well as protecting your kids from inhalants abuse, explaining why intoxication makes them vulnerable while they are young will pave the way for giving them a better understanding of the dangers of alcohol and other drugs in later discussions. Keep Household Inhalants Out of Reach Even if you feel your kid could access inhalants anyway, get into the habit of locking away any potentially poisonous or intoxicating substances, or storing them out of reach.</paragraph><paragraph parID="339">This sends a clear message that these substances are in a special category, unlike other substances, such as food. Protect Yourself and Others While Using Potential Inhalants Even if you have used spray paint without a face mask in the past, as a parent, it is important that you show your kid the proper way to do things. Use a mask, gloves, and other protective clothing, ensure adequate ventilation, do not smoke or allow any exposed flames to the area you are using the substance. Safety precautions show that inhalants are risky substances, which may be needed to correct the messages about inhalants abuse your kids may have learned from inhalant abusing peers.

Children and youth, among the most active users of the Internet and mobile devices, are especially at risk in this new media-marketing ecosystem." Earlier this year, the two groups called on the agency to "conduct a special investigation into mobile marketing privacy threats and inappropriate practices targeting children, adolescents, and multicultural consumers." Consumer Advocate Warns Congress of the Dangers of Invasive Online and Mobile Marketing Practices</paragraph><paragraph parID="349">For Immediate Release: June 18, 2009 Contact: Jeff Chester (202-494-7100) Center for Digital Democracy ( www.democraticmedia.org ) Washington, DC: Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy (CDD), urged Congress today to pass legislation that would ensure meaningful consumer protection online, especially for privacy. As more consumers increasingly rely on the Internet to obtain such sensitive services as financial products or health information, he explained, it is especially critical that the public be assured they will be treated fairly when engaged in online commerce. Chester pointed to the failure of the regulatory system that should have protected Americans from irresponsible business practices that led to the current financial crisis. "As with our financial system, privacy and consumer protection regulators have failed to keep abreast of developments in the area they are supposed to oversee," he explained. "In order to ensure adequate trust in online marketing-an important and growing sector of our economy-Congress must enact sensible policies to protect consumers." "Whether using a search engine, watching an online video, creating content on a social network, receiving an email, or playing an interactive video game, we are being digitally shadowed online," Chester told a joint hearing by the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection, and the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="350">"Our travels through the digital media are being monitored, and digital dossiers on us are being created-and even bought and sold." Singling out behavioral and "predictive" targeting for their violations of user privacy, Chester noted that the "consumer profiling and targeted advertising take place largely without our knowledge or consent, and affects such sensitive areas as financial transactions and health-related inquiries. Chester's CDD, in collaboration with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG), was instrumental in bringing the online privacy issue to the forefront in a series of petitions filed with the Federal Trade Commission in 2006 and 2007. In his formal testimony today, Chester called on Congress to enact meaningful regulations to protect consumer privacy in the online and mobile arenas, effectively bringing the FTC's Fair Information Practice Principles fully into the digital age. "Americans shouldn't have to trade away their privacy and accept online profiling and tracking as the price they must pay in order to access the Internet and other digital media," Chester declared, adding that far from being an impediment to continued growth in the online sector, meaningful privacy safeguards will actually stimulate the digital economy. "The uncertainty over the loss of privacy and other consumer harms will continue to undermine confidence in the online advertising business," he explained. "That's why the online ad industry will actually greatly benefit from privacy regulation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="351">Given a new regulatory regime protecting privacy, industry leaders and entrepreneurs will develop new forms of marketing services where data collection and profiling are done in an above-board, consumer-friendly fashion." The Center for Digital Democracy ( www.democraticmedia.org ) is a Washington-based nonprofit organization dedicated to maintaining the diversity and openness of the media, focusing especially on the new broadband communications systems. CDD's executive director played a leading role in the passage of the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

But there are strategies that will help change kids' behaviour - and strategies that every parent should probably avoid. Here's one: having a cop scare and embarrass a child by pointing out, in front of his or her peers, what "a predator in prison" could do with the information that child has made public on a social networking site.</paragraph><paragraph parID="352">Will Richardson, the "grandfather of blogging in the classroom" details just such a scenario in a recent blog post about a policeman in Cheyenne, Wyoming who was brought into a school to teach kids about MySpace. One important lesson is that it's hard to erase information from the Internet once you've made it public - so using fear tactics about information that has already been posted can certainly be frightening and possibly harmful. You want your child to alter his or her future behaviour - there is nothing to be gained from having a child lose sleep over a decision or action they have already taken. The situation in Cheyenne obviously raised the hackles of some parents - otherwise it wouldn't have been blogged about. The principal of the school in question came to the defense of the police officer , backing his story that he had not gone as far as the students claimed. But it's an important lesson anyway - kids take what we say seriously. And when we have serious messages to impart we have to be careful that we don't go too far.</paragraph><paragraph parID="353">The Service de police de la Ville de Montr&#233;al encourages you to be cautious and to tell you children about the potential dangers of the internet outlined below. But just like the real world, the online world can be dangerous for kids, especially in terms of pedophilia and cyberbullying. Before you let your children surf the net alone, it is crucial that you set rules, and then it is up to you, as a parent, to keep an eye on what your children are doing online. Here are a few safety tips to help you make sure your children stay safe on the Internet: Learn how the Internet works . The best way to find out how your children are using the Internet is to get interested and surf with them. Encourage your children to tell you about their online experiences the same way they tell you about what they do with their friends in the non-virtual world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="354">Establish a set of family Internet rules and talk to your children about the dangers they may be exposed to, such as pedophilia. Remind your children that they must never reveal personal information without your permission (name, address, phone, etc.). Explain that they must never agree to meet an online friend in person . Encourage your children to use nicknames that don't reveal any identifying information (gender, age, etc.). Put the computer in a room that is accessible to the entire family , so your children will not be surfing alone. Don't put a computer in your child's bedroom. Supervise your children's online activities .</paragraph><paragraph parID="355">For example, you can pre-select websites of interest, review the browsing history, check whether the webcam is being used, monitor your children's access to electronic communications (chat, email, messaging), and install a parental control filter. If you notice changes in your child's appearance, behaviour or activities, bring it up with the child and share your concerns. The way you approach the subject will determine your child's reaction and your chances of finding out more. If you suspect your child is involved in a potentially dangerous online activity, don't hesitate to contact your police service. The website offers age-specific Internet safety tips (5-7, 8-9, 10-12 and 13-15 years old), along with a description of the developmental personality of children at these ages and their main online activities. Inform parents of the dangers of cyberspace for their children and the need to take safety measures. Give parents information and practical tools, so they can manage their children's Internet use and teach their children to be safe and savvy surfers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="356">We also recommend that you seek out further information from the specialized organizations presented below: WebAware and Cybertip.

My computer and I have become great partners, and we have embarked into the world of academia together as a team.

In other words, computers are 'convenience' at our fingertips. The idea of borderless communication and convenience 'touched off' ideas in the world of academics, and now there are many institutions that offer classes online. Most online courses are offered to college students, or for working professionals. Online courses allow those who work full-time, or are busy throughout the week, to login to a course at a convenient time of day. Students can be involved in on-going discussions, email each other, and there is even software available for professors to broadcast themselves through web cams.

It is only a very small part of protective behaviour, as 85 per cent of danger or abuse to children occurs with someone known to the child or trusted by the child. The Protective Behaviours Organisations have undertaken work for many years to protect children from all dangers, and help them to be safe in all environments. Protective behaviour should focus on stranger danger, predators, relatives or friends and Internet or online risks. The aim is to teach children to be safe, to be aware of predatory strangers, and to be self protective. Teaching protective behaviours or 'stranger danger' is a delicate balance of raising awareness, without unnecessarily alarming children, or paralysing them with fear.</paragraph><paragraph parID="371">It is equally important to emphasise that the majority of adults are caring, loving and responsible-not 'bad people', to globally fear. It is important to note that the majority of abuse of children occurs through people known to the child or close to them. As such, a typical child response that a stranger is a nasty, bad person shows their immature naivety or lack of understanding. A typical predator will likely be dressed in friendly clothes, be funny or ingratiating, and more likely nice, enticing, or bearing treats and offers. A stranger is any person that they do not know. What to tell your child about a stranger: Tell your child not to listen to or be near a stranger-rather to move away or back inside.</paragraph><paragraph parID="372">Tell your child to never ever go with a stranger-no matter what the stranger says. Tell your child that strangers may make up sad stories, like looking for a lost pet, needing help with a sick child, or needing directions. Tell your child that a stranger should never be believed, no matter what they say. Tell your child that strangers may offer treats, gifts or lollies for 'helping'. Tell your child that you will never send a stranger to collect them. Make a list of the only, known people, you would send to pick them up. However, let's not relax just yet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="373">Research shows that kids often can quote what mum or dad said very well, but when placed in the situation, they more often still give in. At home, role play certain situations with your child, such as pretending mum is sick and that a new person needs to take them home. Role play or practise a variety of strategies or other scenarios. Try a test in a safe environment at home, such as an unfamiliar friend at the front door trying to entice them outside to look at a sick, cute rabbit. Research shows that kids often 'forget' after a period of time. Thus a yearly family refresher course is very worthwhile. Active, protective behaviour</paragraph><paragraph parID="374">Teach your child never to wander off or go out of sight. Teach your child to always walk with and stay with friends-to never go alone. Teach and practice saying NO loudly and repeatedly, if they are unsure. Teach your child to yell HELP, as loudly and repeatedly as possible, until they are heard. Predators hate noise and attention. Teach your child to find a safe adult (a policeman or a mum with a stroller) or a safe spot (if they are fearful) such as a school, shop or safety sign. Encourage your child to 'tell' if they even think they came across a stranger.</paragraph><paragraph parID="375">Encourage your child to 'tell' if they felt scared, unsure or uncomfortable ('yucky' with any adult). Affirm that you will be happy and praise them for 'telling'-that they won't be in trouble. Affirm that you will listen and believe them. Basic protective safety for parents Always know where your children are. Keep your kids within your sight or supervision. Be alert to other people around you, but not paranoid.</paragraph><paragraph parID="376">Be alert to Internet threats-research shows predators are increasingly luring more mature children through the Internet, such as online, through forums, chat lines, and message systems. Always keep young children's computers within your vision (not in their bedrooms), and under your supervision. Install a 'Net-Nanny' or Parental Control Software program on your computer. Teach your child to never ever give out personal or private information. Non stranger danger Be alert to behaviour or interaction, from a relative or friend, that makes you or your child feel uncomfortable. Explain to your child, in age appropriate terms, where touching is not okay, such as touching mouths and areas covered by their swimming costumes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="377">Be alert to overly ingratiating or endearing behaviour that can lead to separation of child and parent. Listen openly at any time your child 'tells' about feeling uncomfortable or 'yucky'. Avoid blaming or being judgmental if your child 'tells'. Be alert for a combination of warning signs of potential danger-the greatest indicator is a change in several behaviours. But be aware that these are only warning signs-they may indicate other concerns: a return to bedwetting, nightmares or disturbed sleep sudden onset of phobias, such as fear of leaving house or fear of dark</paragraph><paragraph parID="378">increase in anxiety, withdrawal or mood swings at unusual times any genital bruising, unusual genital discomfort or repetitive urinary tract infections torn or missing under garments unusual aggression and/or violent or explicit drawings self harming or secretive, inappropriate behaviour resistance to being left with a previously trusted or liked adult. Finally, keep 'danger' in balance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="379">While being alert and pro-active with protective behaviours, remember that a child's world is full of safe, wonderful and positive events.

Internet Safety and Your Tween It's time to talk to your child about Internet safety. According to a 2006 study by the Zandi Group, three in 10 "tweens" (children ages 8-12) have access to the Internet at home. That represents a very large target for entities ranging from legitimate publishers and marketers to scammers and predators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="380">And a potential risk to your child. Internet smart, emotionally vulnerable By the time kids reach middle school, they're likely to know as much or more about the Internet than do their parents. They use the Internet for schoolwork, playing games, email, instant messaging, downloading music, shopping, and entering contests. But although they know their way around the Internet, they may lack the judgment and emotional maturity to steer clear of trouble. Tweens are, after all, still children. And children are vulnerable.</paragraph><paragraph parID="381">That's where you come in. The scope of the threat To help you better understand why your tween needs your support and supervision online, here are some statistics about the Internet experiences of tweens from a 2006 study published by the Polly Klaas Foundation. You'll see that the numbers grow and the threats to safety increase dramatically as tweens become teens, which is why it's critically important to talk to your child now.

These additional statistics culled from recent surveys by the U.S. Department of Justice, Cox Broadcasting and the New Hampshire Crimes Against Children Research Center shed light on what parents do and don't understand about Internet safety. And, again, they highlight the importance of becoming informed and talking to your children now. What You May Not Know</paragraph><paragraph parID="383">33% of tweens and teens say that their parents know little or nothing about what they do online 22% say their parents have never discussed Internet safety with them 51% of parents don't know if they have software on their computers that let them monitor where their children go online 42% of parents don't monitor what their children read or type in chat rooms. 95% of parents don't understand the shorthand lingo kids use in chatrooms, i.e., "A/S/L" (age/sex/location), or "P911" (parent over shoulder) Talk to your child now Talk to your child about Internet safety.</paragraph><paragraph parID="384">Recent research from the New Hampshire Crimes Against Children Research Center indicates that children whose parents talk to them regularly about Internet safety are far less likely to engage in unsafe online behavior. Make sure they understand the difference between safe and unsafe behavior online. You do it in the real world. Do it in the virtual world, too. The same basic rules apply in both places. You teach them to not talk to strangers and to not give their name, phone number, or address to strangers. And you tell them why.</paragraph><paragraph parID="385">Explain to them that the same rules apply online, and why. Ask them to show you the Web sites they visit online. Ask them about who they chat with online. Ask them to show you their page on MySpace or other social networking site. Ask them to show you their list of chat friends, explain who each one is, and how they know them. Remind them of the dangers of posting personal information on public Web sites where it is available to anyone. Get involved</paragraph><paragraph parID="386">In addition to talking to your child, pay attention to what they are doing online. There are a number of ways to do this. One basic recommendation is to place the computer that your child uses in a "public" area of the household, as opposed to the child's bedroom. They are much less likely to engage in unsafe behavior if they are where you can see them. Be informed. Learn more about the Internet and, in particular, chat rooms and social networking Web sites. Visit these sites so you can see how they work, so you'll have a better understanding of how they can be misused.</paragraph><paragraph parID="387">Learn about the computer programs and technology that enable you to limit where your child can go online. Learn how you can monitor where your teen has been on the Internet, and what they've done there. For example, your Web browser records a history of the Web sites your child has visited. Instant messaging programs show you who they chat with. And there are programs available that let you monitor Internet activities even more closely. The bottom line. The virtual world is probably no more dangerous or unsafe than the real world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="388">You talk to your child about the real world. You set rules and boundaries, and codes of acceptable behavior. And you explain why. Do the same for the virtual world. The Internet, like real life, is a wonderful place to for children to learn, experience, and communicate. With your involvement, it won't become something else.

Recently, I have taken an interest in photography and in bowling. I also enjoy chatting and role playing on the computer. Why I advocate for online safety. I really feel that it is important for everyone, especially teenagers, to advocate online safety. And the more people who know about these dangers, the better! In addition, efforts to increase Internet safety awareness might be more effective for teenagers if teenagers are delivering the message!</paragraph><paragraph parID="390">I have been able to keep myself safe online AND still have fun. Are your online friendships different than your real-life friendships? I talk about movies, music, and other things with both groups. However, because of the fact that I don't TRULY know who my online friends are, I am always careful not to reveal personal information such as where I live, or my contact info outside the Internet. How can you help younger siblings or kids be safer online? If I were trying to teach my younger brother or other children to be safe, I would explain what the dangers are and how predators might operate on the Internet. Most importantly, I would lead by example.</paragraph><paragraph parID="391">If I do not "practice what I preach," then the children that I'm trying to instruct might wonder why I'm not following my own guidelines. EU Kids Online has been tracking the online risks faced by children across countries. In some countries, research has produced several quantitative estimates of risk. It appears that high risk countries are those that, on the one hand, are new to the internet (Poland, Czech Republic) and, on the other hand, are experienced with the internet (UK, The Netherlands). The next riskiest are Iceland, Ireland and Estonia - all small northern European countries. The low risk countries, research suggests, are Germany, Norway, Denmark, France and Italy. Unfortunately, few quantitative estimates exist for children's experiences of online risk in some countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.</paragraph><paragraph parID="392">Comparing across risks, rather than across countries, research suggests that some risks are more prevalent and/or more homogenous across countries, than others. Our findings show an approximate ordering of online risks to teenagers as follows: Giving out personal information: this is most common risk - around half of online teens, with considerable cross-national variation (13% to 91%) Seeing pornography: the second most common risk at around 4 in 10 online teens across Europe, but again considerable cross-national variation (25% - 71%) Seeing violent or hateful content: the third most common risk at approximately one third of teens and, apart of a figure of 90% among social networking teens in Ireland, a fair degree of consistency across countries Being bullied/harassed/stalked: generally around 1 in 5 or 6 teens online, though there is also a group of high risk countries here (Poland, possibly Estonia) and one low risk country - Belgium Receiving unwanted sexual comments - only around 1 in 10 teens in Germany, Ireland and Portugal; but closer to 1 in 4 teens in Iceland and Norway (and 1 in 6 in Sweden), rising to 1 in 3 in the UK and 1 in 2 in Poland</paragraph><paragraph parID="393">Meeting an online contact offline - the least common but arguably most dangerous risk; there is considerable consistency in the figures across Europe at around 8% (1 in 12) online teens going to such meetings; the exceptions are Poland (23%) and, especially, the Czech Republic (65%). Interim conclusions (these will be developed in our forthcoming report, due September 2008): There are considerable cross-national variations in the incidence of risk. There seems to be more cross-national variation in the more common risks, and more homogeneity for the less common risks. Poland is a striking outlier, reporting high levels of risk across several categories and being highest for seeing porn, being bullied, receiving unwanted sexual comments, second highest for stranger danger, and third highest for giving out personal information. In some countries it is particular risks that are stand out, but they are not high risk across all risks e.g. Ireland for seeing violent and hateful content and giving out personal information, Czech Republic for giving out personalinformation, Estonia for being bullied. The only country that is somewhat (comparatively) a low risk outlier on a few items is Italy - on porn, seeing hateful content, although the actual figures are not so striking as the high risk outliers, and this is partly because the population surveyed was much younger (7-11 year olds).</paragraph><paragraph parID="394">The above findings illustrate the first step in our ongoing work of systematic comparison and interpretation of findings within EU Kids Online. It is one step to identify a pattern, as in the data above, but quite another to interpret these patterns. The report, due in September 2008, will ask: Where, and to what extent, are there European commonalities or differences regarding children's online experiences, risks and opportunities? What common European responses and patterns exist and what factors explain these? Where there is variation, how is this to be explained? To explain the observed patterns of findings, researchers in the network are assembling national information concerning, for example:</paragraph><paragraph parID="395">The internet (e.g. internet and media content for children, the nature of internet regulation and promotion, factors shaping public discourses about the internet). Media coverage of children and the internet (which is also a separate empirical sub-project within the broader project) The education system (including internet access and use within schools) Wider country-specific factors (e.g. social structures and social change, the role of the state), etc. One challenge involves looking for ways to seek and manage the 'softer' data, this background information about the countries concerned, in order to explore whether these factors influence findings such as those outlined above. The IRELAND team is based in the Centre for Social &amp; Educational Research, at the Dublin Institute of Technology and at the National Centre for Technology in Education, Dublin.

Children need to feel that open lines of communication exist before they feel comfortable discussing their online activities. If you only "check in" on your child to get sound bites of their life, then you probably don't know your child very well. They may resist further probes into the detailed facts of their lives, but children inwardly yearn for such attention because it is a sign that you really care. This allows you the freedom to ask about the people they interact with online, and it gives your child the freedom to come to you when they have questions about any online situations they encounter. The importance of strong relational ties also extends to your child's friends.</paragraph><paragraph parID="397">It is very likely that the same kids who are close friends with your child in real life are also friends with them on online social networking sites. By understanding the backgrounds and interests of your child's friends, you can get a better grasp of the type of people they will attract. Since online social networking sites are usually designed to reduce the degrees of separation between people, online predators who are drawn to the friends of your child will often come into closer virtual proximity to your child. Privacy Acts Parents and guardians hold the key to the online safety of children. We live in a celebrity obsessed culture, and many people involved in social media measure their own " internet fame " by how many people are friends with them on Facebook, follow them on Twitter, watch their YouTube videos, comment on their blogs, etc. Children are particularly prone to this desire to have large numbers of online followers because this is often tied to popularity in the real world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="398">I recommend that parents and guardians set a rule for very young children that they only maintain online connections with people they actually know. That means that it is fine to have online connections to other students in their school system or their peers with whom they engage in extracurricular activities (e.g., sports, religious activities, volunteer groups, etc.). However, if they want to connect to anyone they don't know, then they need to explain to you why such a connection is necessary. How can a this rule be monitored? I believe that children under the age of 13 should be required to have at least one parent or guardian be connected to them on any online social network in which they participate. That means you should be friends with them on Facebook, follow them on Twitter, subscribe to their YouTube channel, etc. That gives you visibility to the child's circle of online of friends and the ability to question any connections they make.</paragraph><paragraph parID="399">Parents and guardians also need to understand how to help their children understand the privacy settings of the online social networking sites they use. Parents also need to make sure their kids understand that their password should not be shared with anyone. I also think that it is fine if children don't reveal their passwords to their parents. Strong relationships require an atmosphere of trust, and it is important that children believe that some aspects of their privacy are protected. However, if there are any signs that a child is engaged in inappropriate online activities, then the parent has the right to forbid access to online social networks for a set period of time. Block First but Tackle if Necessary Ultimately, parents are responsible for the online protection of young people.</paragraph><paragraph parID="400">Even if you tightly restrict the number and type of people you child interacts with when using online social networks, it is likely that they may encounter objectionable content or behavior. This can take the form of pictures or videos that show their peers engaging in activities that go against the values you want your child to follow. Or, someone may seek to embarrass your child by making negative comments about them online or posting unflattering pictures. It is also possible that YOUR child may be the one that is trying to hurt someone using an online social network! It's important to first talk with your child and come to an agreement that the behavior is inappropriate. If you've done a good job building a strong relationship with your child, then they will come to you when they see something online that disturbs them. This will help them buy into the assessment that the behavior is wrong and needs to be addressed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="401">Many people who do things like try to bully others online are looking for a reaction. By not reacting, that person is robbed of the outcome they sought to obtain though their behavior. So, encouraging your child to not respond to the online activity is often a good first step. If the person doing the inappropriate behavior is not a close friend of your child, you probably should advise your child to block their account. However, " defriending " someone is often seen as an offensive act, so it is probably a good idea to have your child directly address the person about their behavior whether it is a good friend or not. You can coach your child on how to do this, and such experiences are often valuable teachable moments for helping your child deal with future interpersonal contacts. Yet, you should be prepared to speak with the parent or guardian of the offending child if your child is uncomfortable doing this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="402">If the offensive behavior persists despite repeated attempts to block the person from interacting with your child, then tackle the problem head on by reporting it to the administrators of the online social network. Facebook makes this easy by including a "Report This" on almost every page whether it is your child's wall or inbox. Other sites have similar mechanisms for reporting bad behavior. You should be prepared to call the police if the behavior is particularly egregious or if you believe that your child's life is in danger. Law enforcement is becoming aware at the growing threat of online harassment, and officers are getting better at dealing with these issues. However, be prepared to present of evidence of the behavior by taking screenshots and printing out examples of what is happening to your child. Finally, if your child is the one who is doing the bullying, then you should immediately address the issue.</paragraph><paragraph parID="403">Explain that they should only say things online that they would tell someone in person. If that is not deterrent enough, then consider removing their access to the internet (including mobile devices with online access) until they demonstrate the maturity necessary to have the privilege restored. By building strong relationships, protecting their privacy, and blocking (and reporting when necessary) inappropriate behaviors, parents and guardians can set safe boundaries for the online identities and activities of their children. It's 2 A.M., do you know who's looking at your child's Facebook profile? Children and teen-agers are putting an unprecedented amount of information about themselves on online social networking sites like Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube . These sites are popular because they provide a global platform for communicating to the world. That is why marketers, public relations professionals, entrepreneurs, and other people who seek to reach a global audience have embraced online social networking sites.</paragraph><paragraph parID="404">However, this global platform also attracts a demographic that often lacks the decision making skills to properly protect themselves from online danger:  children. Children of all ages are exposed to near ubiquitous access to the internet. Children lack the maturity to deal with the exposure provided by online social networking sites. This leaves them vulnerable to those who would exploit this vulnerability in order to bring harm to a child. This includes child predators, stalkers, or even other children who may use sites like Facebook as a platform for bullying . It is important that parents and guardians understand how to protect their children from the potential risks of maintaining an online presence. There are three simple steps that can be done to protect children who participate in online social networks.</paragraph><paragraph parID="405">1. Relationship Matters Spending quality time offline will provide a foundation for moderating online relationships. The first step in protecting your child online is making sure you have a healthy relationship offline. By having a strong relationship with your child, you earn the right to have open discussions about what they do and are exposed to online. 2. One of the first principles a parent or guardian needs to explain to a child is the importance of privacy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="406">I recommend that children under the age of 13 should protect their tweets on Twitter meaning that people need to request to follow them on Twitter. Facebook is a more closed platform than Twitter, but some of the privacy settings are set to be open to everyone by default. In general, these need to be changed to "Only Friends". 3.

Where Do Kids Connect?</paragraph><paragraph parID="411">&#8226; Kids go online almost anywhere. They surf the Internet and send messages from a home computer or one at a friend's home, library, or school. &#8226; Kids connect at coffee shops and other "hotspots" using laptops and wireless connections. &#8226; Internet-enabled, video-game systems allow them to compete against and chat with players around the world. &#8226; Wireless devices enable kids to surf the Web and exchange messages, photographs, and short videos from just about anywhere.</paragraph><paragraph parID="412">You can't watch your kids every minute, but you do need to use strategies to help them benefit from the Internet and avoid its potential risks.

This brochure provides a list of the most popular online activities for kids along with the strategies for and benefits of reducing the potential risks associated with those activities. According to the U.S. Department of Education, 23 percent of nursery school children in the United States use the Internet, 32 percent of kindergartners go online, and by high school 80 percent of children use the Internet.

Many Internet service providers (ISPs) offer filters to prevent kids from accessing inappropriate websites. Contact your ISP about what safe-search options they offer. Remember, as a consumer you have a right to choose an ISP with the</paragraph><paragraph parID="416">people all over the world. &#8226; Kids are able to set up private accounts through free Web-based, e-mail services without asking permission from parents or guardians. &#8226; Anyone using e-mail is vulnerable to receiving "spam," messages from people or companies encouraging recipients to buy something, do something, or visit a particular website. Spam may be sexually suggestive or offensive in other ways. &#8226; Senders sometimes disguise themselves, pretending to be someone else - a friend or acquaintance, a well-known bank, a government agency - for illicit purposes. This is known as phishing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="417">Tips to Minimize Potential Risks &#8226; Talk with your kids about their e-mail accounts, and discuss the potential risks involved. Remind them to never share passwords with anyone but you, not even their closest friends. &#8226; Before you sign up with a service provider, research the effectiveness of its spam filters.</paragraph><paragraph parID="418">You may also purchase spam-filter software separately. &#8226; Teach kids not to open spam or e-mails from people they don't know in Remind them not to respond to any online communication in a sexually provocative way.

Your provider 's address is usually found on their home page. Instant Messaging</paragraph><paragraph parID="419">Instant Messaging (IM) allows adults and kids to have conversations in "real time" through their computer. IMing is particularly appealing to kids who use abbreviated lingo to communicate with each other. Most IM services offer a feature showing a user's contacts, known as a "buddy list," which tells the user whether a "buddy" is online and available to chat. IM is one method used to cyberbully, harass, or intimidate others. It may also be used to engage kids in a sexually explicit conversation. IM interactions may go from an innocent conversation to a sexually explicit or otherwise inappropriate exchange without warning. &#8226; Remind kids to IM only people they know in real life and who have been approved by you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="420">Make sure other users cannot search for your child by his or her email address and username. &#8226; Make sure both your kids and you are familiar with the blocking features available on most IM services. Tell your kids to block any sender they don't know who IMs them. &#8226; Take the time to learn the online lingo used by kids so you understand what they are talking about with each other. &#8226; What's a P911? It's shorthand for "parent alert" - a code some kids use to let others know a parent or guardian is watching. If you have trouble translating your kids' online "lingo," visit www.NetSmartz.org.</paragraph><paragraph parID="421">There you'll find a list of popular terms and abbreviations used in IM and chatrooms. Social Networking Social-networking websites allow kids to connect with their friends and other users with similar interests. Kids socialize and express themselves by exchanging instant messages, e-mails, or comments and posting photographs, creative writing, artwork, videos, and music to their blogs and personal profiles. Some 55% of online teens have profiles on a social-networking website such as Facebook or MySpace. A survey of 10 to 17 year olds revealed 34% had posted their real names,</paragraph><paragraph parID="422">telephone numbers, home addresses, or the names of their schools online where anyone could see; 45% had posted their dates of birth or ages; and 18% had posted pictures of themselves. While these profiles help kids "connect" and share common interests, potential exploiters may pretend to be someone else and can and do use these profiles to search for victims. &#8226; Kids sometimes compete to see who has the greatest number of contacts and will add new members to their lists even if they don't know them in person. &#8226; Kids can't "take back" the online text and images they've entered. Kids may post information and images that are provocative and inappropriate. Once online, "chat" as well as other Web postings become public information. Anything posted online may be saved and forwarded to an unlimited number of users.</paragraph><paragraph parID="423">Remind kids once images are posted they lose control of them and can never get them back. &#8226; Kids have been reprimanded by their school administrators and families; denied entry into schools; and even not hired because of dangerous, demeaning, or harmful information found on their personal websites or &#8226; Urge kids to use privacy settings to restrict access to profiles so only those on their contact lists are able to view them. &#8226; Remind kids to only add people they know in person to their contact lists. &#8226; Encourage them to choose appropriate screennames or nicknames-such as those that refer to sports and interests, but are not sexual, violent, or</paragraph><paragraph parID="424">It's up to parents and guardians to assess the potential risks and benefits of &#8226; Kids may come across websites containing adult images or demeaning, &#8226; It is hard for kids to distinguish reliable sources of information from less reliable ones.

By talking about Internet use with your kids, you are opening the door to discussing the important issues of personal safety and helping them engage in responsible behavior.

" Also urge your kids not to respond to any rude or harassing messages or ones making them feel scared, uncomfortable, or confused. Have them show you such messages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="429">Cellular Telephones/Wireless Devices and Texting Many parents and guardians look at cellular telephones as a necessity for their kids. It is reassuring to know they may reach you or call for help in an emergency. Cellular telephones/wireless devices may also be used to send text messages, images, and videos. &#8226; Cellular telephones make it easy for kids to communicate with others without their parents' or guardians' knowledge. &#8226; Kids are increasingly using cellular telephones/wireless devices to take sexually explicit photographs of themselves and send them to their friends. Once these photographs are sent, there is no way of getting them back.</paragraph><paragraph parID="430">In some instances children have been prosecuted for production of child pornography for taking these pictures. &#8226; Kids may also take embarrassing or revealing photographs of others and post them to the Internet, leaving victims few options to defend or protect themselves from this form of bullying. &#8226; Create rules about the appropriate use of cellular telephones/wireless devices and set limits, including who your kids may communicate with and when they may use their cellular telephones/wireless devices &#8226; Review cellular-telephone/wireless-device records for any unknown numbers and late-night telephone calls &#8226; Teach your kids to never post their cellular telephone number anywhere online &#8226; Talk to your kids about the possible implications of sending sexually explicit or provocative images of themselves or others &#8226; Think about removing the Internet features from your kid's cellular telephone/wireless device through your service provider or consider creating settings to control or prohibit access to the Internet, e-mail, or text messaging.</paragraph><paragraph parID="431">Webcams, cellular telephones, and digital cameras allow kids to post videos, photographs, and audio files online and engage in video conversations. Kids often use this equipment to see each other as they IM and chat. Webcams are often used to help kids stay in touch with family members and friends including traveling parents and guardians and those living in other areas. &#8226; Webcam sessions and photographs may be easily captured and saved, and users may continue to circulate those images online. In some cases people believed they were interacting with trusted friends but later found their images were distributed to others or posted on websites.</paragraph><paragraph parID="432">&#8226; Capturing, sending and posting sexually provocative and inappropriate images may lead to legal implications and other unexpected offline consequences. &#8226; Kids should use webcams or post photographs online only with your knowledge and supervision. &#8226; Remind your kids to ask themselves if they would be embarrassed if their friends or family saw the pictures or videos they post online. If the answer is yes, then they need to stop. &#8226; Remind kids to be aware of what is in the camera's field of vision and remember to turn the camera off when it is not in use. &#8226; Caution kids about posting identity-revealing or sexually provocative photographs. Don't allow them to post photographs of others - even their friends - without permission from their friends' parents or guardians.</paragraph><paragraph parID="433">Remind them once such images are posted they lose control of them and can never get them back. Online Gaming Online gaming involves playing a game over a computer network, often on the Internet, or Internet-enabled game console.
