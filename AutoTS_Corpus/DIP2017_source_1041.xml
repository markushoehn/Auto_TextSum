Parents of limited English proficient children placed in a language instruction educational program must be notified, no later than 30 days after the start of the school year, of the reason for their child's placement and the child's level of proficiency. Parents of students enrolled in a Title I Targeted Assistance school must be notified that their child has been identified as eligible to receive Title I services based on a specific entrance criteria. Parents must be notified promptly if their child's school has been designated as a "school in need of improvement." Parents must be notified of their right to request intra district public school choice (option to move to a higher performing school in the district school, if available). Parents of income eligible students who attend a Title I school identified as in need of improvement must be notified of the availability of supplemental educational services (SES), including the list of SES providers and/or the link to the list of SES providers on the NJDOE web site. The following table outlines the interventions for Title I Schools as they move along the continuum after each consecutive year that they do not make adequate yearly progress.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">Parents can visit our Parent Circle at http://www.nj.gov/education/parents/ which has helpful links and direct links to subscribe to the Governor's Education list serve and to be able to reach our Title I e-mail help desk. Title I is a federal program under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) as reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB). The purpose of Title I is to ensure that all children have a fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards and state academic assessments. Each district that receives Title I, Part A funds must develop a written parental involvement policy that establishes the district's expectations for parental involvement. The district policy must be developed jointly with, and agreed upon with, the parents of children participating in Title I, Part A programs and distributed to parents of all children participating in Title I, Part A programs. School-Parent-Student compacts must also be developed in partnership with parents that outline the responsibilities for all three parties in the educational process. Communication efforts must be ongoing and sustained and encourage parental involvement in many facets of the planning, development, and implementation stages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">A List of the Required Title I Parent Notification and Documentation Includes:  Written parent involvement policies, developed in collaboration with parents of participating Title I students.

The development and implementation of inservice workshops to train  teachers/administrators in parent involvement . Many parents in my research admit that their primary interest in decision making is focused on their own children. Parent interviewees wish to be involved more directly in their child&#65533;s schooling, not involved in the common good for the entire school. Many parents in my research admit that their primary interest in decision making is focused on their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="5">Challenges from traditional parent involvement must be addressed as teachers and parents begin building the new relationships necessary for increased parent involvement in local school governance. Traditional parent involvement where parents follow the instructions of teachers no longer satisfies the parent interviewees who have identified fears and tension between families and schools. This surfaces as insecurity and intimidation, distrust, and protection of territory. Tensions identified in this research include insider/outsider of the teaching profession, trust/mistrust of each other, formal/informal decision-making structures, and self-interests of the individual child/group. Tensions identified in this research include insider/outsider of the teaching profession, trust/mistrust of each other, formal/informal decision-making structure, and self-interests of the individual child/group. Parents in this study describe their insecurity at meetings with other adults at Home and School Association meetings, teachers talk defensively about being verbally attacked by angry parents, and parents share discomfort entering schools due to their own level of education or past experiences in schools. For example, a mother felt extremely intimidated by other adults at her first Home and School Association meeting:</paragraph><paragraph parID="6">Parents agree, as one mother warns, &#65533;Be aware of personal agendas&#65533; (P:1, p. 20). One parent warns, &#65533;Be aware of personal agendas&#65533; (P:1, p. 20) Parents also express their concern over what community members may hear in the staff room and share with other people in the neighbourhood. A teacher respondent claims, &#65533;You have to draw the line between staff and parents&#65533; (T:4, p. 11). Parents sense this. One parent expresses her concern, &#65533;There&#65533;s a boundary existing between the two groups&#65533; (P:8, p. 19). Parents are outsiders in schools no matter how much they are given to do nor how much they are invited to enter the school&#65533;s &#65533;inner&#65533; circle.</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">They know that better than teachers do, and they respect it. Many adults are very cautious about doing much beyond the instruction from the teacher because they know their place. Parents are never quite insiders because the minute they go too far they are subtly reminded that they are stepping into professional territory. According to research, this attitude comes in varying degrees. Educators feel threatened about intrusions into their territory and parents are not sure if they trust teachers or other parents. Research participants identified formal training, support groups and administrative support necessary for successful implementation and maintenance of increased parent involvement in local school governance. Research participants identified support groups, administrative support, and formal training necessary for successful implementation and maintenance of increased parent involvement in local school governance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="8">A parent also sees value in a support group where she could discuss concerns and share ideas, &#65533;You know this is a problem I am having. Although he appreciates having a co-coach, he displays a lack of experience in working interdependently with parents. Both parents and teachers feel that parents should be qualified for their involvement in schools. When and how to provide parent and teacher training poses a dilemma. Several parents and educators identify time as a barrier to meeting. One parent states, &#65533;I don&#65533;t think that parents have time for workshops or anything like that. Parents prefer evenings whereas teachers prefer inservice days, not after 3:30 when they are exhausted from a long day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="9">The production of training videos, booklets, or pamphlets would be appreciated by parents and teachers. Parent respondents talk about open, two-way communication between themselves and teachers rather than the kind of teacher-controlled communication they experience at present. Parent interviewees have identified a need for additional communication and express concern with one-way teacher-directed communication. A parent respondent states her difficulty with today&#65533;s parent/teacher communication patterns, &#65533;A parent/teacher partnership is not where parents are told what to do. She adds, &#65533;And if parent input is solicited, then it should be considered seriously&#65533; (P:8, p. 13). Parent respondents express a need for increased communication between home and school, particularly pertaining to the children&#65533;s education in the classroom. They want their children to reach their academic potential and are willing to work with their child at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="10">Parent interviewees want to understand the curriculum and teacher expectations and plead for additional opportunities to discuss children&#65533;s progress; whether it be on the telephone or at parent/teacher conferences. They are frustrated with the lack of communication they receive about their child, the curriculum, and expectations at their child&#65533;s grade level. Parent respondents believe the benefits of understanding the curriculum and expectations are invaluable and would appreciate additional information. Two-way communication regarding learning styles, interests, motivation and problems children encounter is deemed essential. Parents want school staffs to ask for their opinions on school matters and to listen to what they have to say. Sarason (1995) concurs that most parents want to share their knowledge about their children in a form usable to others. Two parents requested a schedule of preferred times to call teachers and another suggested hosting parent/teacher interviews in the evenings and more frequently.</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">Parent/Teacher interviews provide an opportunity for teachers and parents to discuss and make decisions regarding the child&#65533;s education program or plan. Teacher participants point out that parents are not fully aware of all that happens in the classroom. Parents are most familiar with their child and their child&#65533;s stories of school, rather than understanding the larger school scene. Teachers are expected to carry a broad interest whereas parents tend to have a narrower focus on their child. One parent respondent provides an example of the limited viewpoint of some parents, &#65533;Parents should have power to decide which classroom the student will be in&#65533; (P:3, p. 13). Another describes herself as being more aggressive and vocal and wanting power in decision making. She had to fight for equality for her special needs child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">These parents are not considering what is best for the child&#65533;s education from the educator&#65533;s perspective, nor for other children in the building. Teachers base their decisions on the needs of, and for the good of, the individuals and the class. It is difficult for anyone to remove themselves from their biases, although common goals and self-awareness can reduce them. Educators, through improved communication with families, can increase awareness of the common goals. Creating numerous hand-outs, regular newsletters, signing agenda books, talk mail, and developing videos and sending them home are successful methods of communicating with parents, shares an experienced teacher (T:5, p.17). Some teachers and parents do experience positive, healthy relationships through open communication. Annual orientation or information evenings where teachers share long range plans, curriculum and behavior expectations are extremely well received by parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">Creating numerous hand-outs, regular newsletters, signing agenda books, talk mail, and developing videos and sending them home are successful methods of communicating with parents, shares an experienced teacher (T:5, p. 17). Through proper training, teachers can learn how to communicate with parents of various socio-economic and cultural backgrounds and personalities. Teachers and parents can learn how to deal or act with each other. Dunning (1995) states that schools, parents, and community members should agree upon clearly articulated roles for each constituency within the school community. Through discussions, teachers and parents develop their parameters of control over content, methodologies, techniques and classroom norms. Finding this balance between parent involvement through school councils and the authority of school boards promises to be a major challenge for those involved. Questions arise from both groups regarding their authority and role.</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">Some parents and teachers are apprehensive about working together. Parent and teacher interviewees agree there is great value in having parents involved in schooling and that there would be reduced tension if they more clearly understood their mutual roles. In Taylor&#65533;s study (1992), parents felt that instruction was best left to teachers, but they did want greater participation for parents in school governance, setting budget priorities, and in the education of each and every child at the school. Parents and teachers in this study feel strongly that parent volunteers must be qualified for whatever roles they assume. Educators worry whether parents have enough information to make sound decisions about schools. SSTA research (1997) further suggests that parents do not have sufficient experience to deal with all aspects of an educational system. Research participants feel there are certain aspects of education that are more appropriate to be involved with than others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">Parent interviewees expressed little desire to become involved in curriculum, other than to understand what their child is doing, and to suggest modifications if there are problems. They agree that teachers are more qualified to deal with curricular matters, but want them to share information on how parents can help their children and provide enrichment. Parent respondents provided positive comments about educators and what they are accomplishing with curriculum. This is consistent with other research where it has been observed that parents tend to avoid working with curriculum. All research participants are excited about parents providing extracurricular activities for students. Parents feel unprepared to become involved in interviewing and hiring and prefer to only be involved with marginal teachers they encounter in the school. Teacher interviewees agree that individual parents should not become involved in staffing because parents are not always fully aware of teacher competencies and may make inappropriate decisions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">Parents are willing, as a group, to make suggestions to the principal in terms of staffing needs. Parents, through the Home and School Association, could recommend criteria for the administration to consider,&#65533; suggests one parent (P:4, p.19). Increased Numbers of Involved Parents Parents and teachers brainstorm ideas about how to draw other adults into schools. Barriers of intimidation, insecurity and lack of time must be addressed. Respondents state that parents need to be aware of the benefits of parent involvement and how to participate in their children&#65533;s schooling in various capacities. Participants offered suggestions on how to get more parents involved: through publicity campaigns to increase awareness and by promoting the benefits of parent involvement for students, parents, schools and communities; and through personal invitation from parents and school staff.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">Other parents who wish to contribute at the school could complete surveys outlining their areas of interest, hobbies, talents, and times available for involvement at school. A parent volunteer coordinator could then coordinate parents, classroom needs and activities. It has been suggested by several teachers and parents that socializing together will improve communication, comfort, trust, and in turn increase the number of actively involved parents. Time has been mentioned over and over as an obstacle to parent involvement in local school governance. Teacher schedules are restrictive and parents have work and family commitments. Several parent interviewees claim that they &#65533;cannot put anything else on their plate&#65533; (P:1, p. 31). Henderson and Berra&#65533;s research (1994) revealed that 66 per cent of working parents indicated that they do not have enough time for their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">If lack of time continues to restrict parent involvement it may be an indicator of a deeper problem: lack of commitment to the education of children. The issue may be lack of awareness of the benefits of parent involvement in their child&#65533;s education. Time is available if there is an increased level of commitment placed upon it (Covey, 1989). Back to Contents Recommendations Not Another Level of Bureaucracy     Although changes in parent involvement have been legislated in neighboring provinces, only one interviewee had heard of these changes. Respondents were unaware of the Saskatchewan Association of School Councils and the Saskatchewan Education discussions for new direction. Saskatchewan Education could initiate a publicity campaign to create an awareness of the benefits of increased parent involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">Several parents agree that parents could have a stronger voice in the governance of their schools, but expressed concerned about the structure, the time, and the commitment for this to occur. The people of Saskatchewan, as reported in the SSTA School councils: The Saskatchewan vision (1996), do not want another level of bureaucracy that hinders decision making and the timeliness of decision making. Parents indicate that they shy away from bureaucracy and educators have stated that they fear another level of bureaucracy that school councils may become after implementation. Only one of the eight parents expressed a desire to communicate to government officials or elected boards outside of the school. Saskatchewan Education should establish a mechanism for parents who want to contribute at a provincial level: for example, create a list of parent volunteers who can be recruited when needed. The doors need to be kept open to these interested volunteers and a structure for their input must be developed. Back to Contents</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">Implementation of Increased Parent Involvement in Local School Governance     Future amendments to the Education Act should outline school council rights and responsibilities, yet allowing enough flexibility for schools to meet their specific community needs. McCollum (1996) stated that government reforms need several years for planning gradual implementation and flexible assessment. The change process does not have an endpoint; parent involvement in local school governance will evolve as parents and teachers learn how to work together and develop new attitudes. Comer suggests implementation only if parents and staff are honestly committed to increased parent involvement (Drake, 1995). Administrators are obliged to provide materials and inservicing for teachers and parents for professional development in the area of parent involvement in local school governance. Parents come from diverse backgrounds with distinct needs and wants. Through discussions with parents, community members and staffs, parent and teacher roles within each school can be clearly defined.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">Once goals and responsibilities have been developed, they must also be clearly articulated and documented. Careful formation of goals will prevent too much control going to special interest groups. The fine line of power between home and school in decision making should be understood by all, thus minimizing negative interactions. Parents and teachers in the study feel strongly that parent volunteers must be qualified for whatever roles they assume. Smrekar (1996) speaks highly of the parent involvement at this school compared to the other two schools in her case study. It is mentioned by most interviewees that volunteers must possess adequate qualifications and be screened before working with children. Malaspina (1993), Butler (1992), and Conley (1993) found that lack of time appears to be an issue for teachers and parents: teachers have little time available for meetings due to the rigid structure of school days and parents may have jobs and other commitments to schedule around.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">Teachers have little time available for meetings due to the rigid structure of school days and parents may have jobs and other commitments to schedule around. As Payne states, the poor either consider themselves unworthy, or they are too oppressed or too disinterested; whereas the rich can afford private education, if they are at odds with public system (1997). Inadequate parent training in the various aspects of education is yet another barrier. David (1994) states that the lack of expertise is clearly a reason why curriculum and instruction issues are not addressed by parent councils. Parents are more comfortable addressing issues such as discipline and extracurricular activities. Gaffuri (1992) addresses the issue that teachers are often not adequately trained to work with parents. The school system in her study assumed that all teachers had mastered information distribution to parents; however in reality, very few were prepared.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">Malaspina (1993) also found that barriers to parent involvement include an absence of preservice education for teachers concerning working with parents, and little provision during the school year for much staff development of any kind. Administrative support and specialized training for parents and teachers are identified in current literature. Principals are viewed as a key factor in the success or failure of school-based decision making and parent involvement. Davies et al. (1992) observed that principal support appears to be essential in reaching acceptable decisions for two reasons: input from school staffs is required and the process is quite different from the usual operating procedures in traditional schools. Administration must coordinate, manage, support, fund, and recognize parent involvement in order for teachers to successfully involve parents (Butler, 1992). A need exists for specialized training for teachers in both undergraduate education and staff development to provide parent skills. Gaffuri (1992), Warm (1990), and Malaspina (1993) found that teachers are not trained to work with parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">Teachers claim they want to learn how to get to know parents, how to authentically and comfortably involve them in classrooms and in other aspects of education. Results of an American wide survey were shared at a Parent Involvement Summit. Four thousand eight hundred Parent Teacher Associations (PTA) chapter presidents had been surveyed and only 30 per cent indicated that their school offered parental involvement training for the staff (Butler, 1992). In a study looking at teacher agreement and attitudes on parent involvement, Kopacsi and Koopmans (! In Gaffuri&#65533;s (1992) research it was found that having both parents and teachers at the same training sessions is effective and that separate training furthers the distance between them. Jewell and Rosen (1993) studied educational reform in New York and discovered that parents needed to know more about a variety of areas: budgets, decision making, and curriculum, in order to participate meaningfully in discussions about the school. Conley (1993) states that expanded parent roles can occur when parents become knowledgeable about learner outcomes, setting learning goals with teacher and students, communicating with teachers about the child&#65533;s interests and learning styles, becoming involved in local school governance, and advocating and supporting change in the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">Back to Contents PART II - CURRENT PARENT INVOLVEMENT IN TWO URBAN SCHOOL COMMUNITIES IN SASKATCHEWAN Background to Parent Involvement in Saskatchewan     Increased parent involvement in public education is certain in Saskatchewan. Other provinces have implemented policies and strategies for increased parent involvement in local school governance and the Saskatchewan government appears to be following suit in its discussions of restructuring education.

INTRODUCTION     Increasing the parent involvement in local school governance is about re-establishing roles and developing trust relationships with new partners. The thesis addresses the question of how parents and teachers view increased parent involvement in local school governance and what support they require for this change. Our newspapers, magazines and governments describe and demand increased parent participation in schools. There exists much interest in recognizing the rights of parents to make educational decisions concerning their children, along with a trend that emphasizes the importance of home and school collaboration to meet the needs of children (Gareau and Sawatsky, 1995).</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">The process of schooling is moving from a top-down model delivering professionalized and bureaucratized educational services to passive and apathetic students to a collaborative or bottom-up model, with parent and community involvement in governance, decision making and advocacy at the local school level (House, 1995, p. 29). Our current hierarchical, bureaucratic structure is becoming ineffective in meeting needs in education today. The top-down model reflects the hierarchical world of the past, where parents were denied access to educational decision making, and where respect for authority sheltered the system from criticism by parent groups&#65533; (House, 1995, p.35). The move from centralization to decentralization, site-based management, or local school governance are results of the shift from top-down governance. As emphasized by House (1995), &#65533;The process of schooling is moving from a top-down model delivering professionalized and bureaucratized educational services to passive and apathetic students to a collaborative or bottom-up model, with parent and community involvement in governance, decision making and advocacy at the local school level&#65533; (p. 29). Transition from a top-down hierarchy to one of decentralized must take into consideration the rights and tradition of the prior system. The shift of authority and responsibility from the school system to parent and community is a change from those distant to those closest to the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">Riley (1995) also describes the relationship between schools and parents as one of unequal power. He suggests that parents were expected to follow the instructions of professionals who continued to separate themselves even further from the community &#65533;by adopting arcane professional dialogue&#65533; (p. 11). This language barrier tended to further distance parents from school activities. Other interested parents felt alienated from school life. Gareau and Sawatsky (1995) went as far as to claim that &#65533;schools discouraged parental intrusion, and the education function of parents was downplayed&#65533; (p. 464). Many parents had unpleasant experiences as students and are still reluctant to enter schools today. Butler (1992) discovered that some parents are extremely interested in being involved, not only as classroom volunteers, but as decision makers and advocates in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">These parents continue to spark the current developing educational philosophy of parent involvement in local school governance. Unfortunately, teachers and administrators have not ranked parent involvement as important as have these parents. Dewey (1968) uses strong language to decry this preferred educator-control. He refers to it as a subtle form of suppression that &#65533; becomes habitual and tradition and becomes the normal way of doing things&#65533; (p. 58) and challenges parents to become active in education. School Councils Today, parents are being organized into structures often called school councils. These councils are designed to be proactive and a part of the decision-making process, rather than reactive and having things being done to them (Dukacz and McCarthy, 1995).</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">It is the process of inclusion in decision making, rather than the resulting decision, that is important. School-based decision-making models have been implemented and studied extensively in North America. Observations reveal that parents are frequently being included as members of these school based teams. Gareau and Sawatsky (1995) believe that educational reform calls for local school governance or school-based management which includes parents as part of the decision-making team. School councils in Canada tend to be advisory in nature, versus &#65533;the real power&#65533;. Additional power may come as councils become more established, and governments become more confident in the councils&#65533; ability. A serious concern for all jurisdictions is what to do should there be lack of interest in forming a council.</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">In Alberta, parents were assigned considerable power under Premier Ralph Klein in the early 1990's. These (Alberta) parent councils have an advisory role, but if the administration does not support the direction of the council, there must be justification made to them as to why not. Council authority now stretches from curriculum, principal selection, budget priorities, school year calender, school behavior, and facility use to anti-racism and anti-violence policies. Parent councils have recommended to increase the power for councils whereas teachers, principals, and school boards recommend a less powerful role. Two well researched councils include the city of Chicago and the state of Kentucky, where the implementation of councils was mandated. Chicago believed that it had the reputation of having the worst public education in America. In response, the Chicago School Reform Act (1988) was passed and mandated an educational structure change from top-down to bottom-up, giving parents power at the school level &#65533;to end twenty years of futile effort to improve&#65533; (Fruchter, 1992, p. 76).</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">Parent councils, composed of the principal, six parents, two community representatives and two teachers, run the school; approving budgets, recommending curriculum, and hiring and firing administrators. This resulted in a class action suit which was won by the principals. Observations today show that much of the council&#65533;s daily operational powers have been forfeited to principals while councils debate political and other issues. Kentucky legislated site-based decision making with the passing of the Kentucky Education Reform Act in April, 1990. Power was given to councils consisting of the principal (chair), three teachers elected by the staff, and two parents selected from the parents&#65533; organization. School boards, however, remained in existence to act as policy arbitrators. Councils act as policy-makers and oversee a wide range of responsibilities: curriculum and instruction, discipline, budget, allocation of space and students, and are accountable to the state and National Education Departments.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">Barriers to Parent Involvement in Local School Governance     The literature describes numerous obstacles to parent involvement in local school governance. Schaeffer and Betz (1992) have created three categories of barriers to parent involvement: human nature factors, communication factors, and external factors. Parents and teachers in Taylor&#65533;s research (1992) concur that in order for the home and school partnership to success, new attitudes must be learned. Human Nature Factors Human nature factors may be defined as threats to one&#65533;s self esteem, such as fear of failure, fear of criticism, or of each other&#65533;s differences (Schaeffer and Betz, 1992). Although parent involvement in instruction has been clearly linked to student success (Epstein, 1992), many teachers and administrators are negligent at establishing meaningful connections between home and school. Parents and teachers in Taylor&#65533;s research (1992) concur that in order for the home and school partnership to succeed, new attitudes must be learned.</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">In some cases, parents actually felt that their children might be singled out or treated unfairly in grading their by teachers who deemed parents to be interfering&#65533; (Marchesani, 1993, p. 58). A study of the power struggle of parents in the Chicago school system found that &#65533;many parents were chided by teachers and administrators for their arrogance in thinking they could run the schools&#65533; (Marchesani, 1993, p. 11). Dixon&#65533;s research (1992) outlined that the barrier to more parent involvement is &#65533;not parent apathy but lack of support from educators&#65533; (p. 15). In some cases, parents actually felt that their children might be singled out or treated unfairly in grading by teachers who deemed parents to be interfering&#65533; (Marchesani, 1993, p. 58). She states, &#65533;Despite the strong confirmation by statistics and research reports of the benefits of parent involvement, programs are still rare and resistance from teachers is often strong&#65533; (p.12). Teacher control creates walls between home and school and limits parent involvement. Despite the strong confirmation by statistics and research reports of the benefits of parent involvement, programs are still rare and resistance from teachers is often strong&#65533; (Carlson, 1991, p. 12).</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">Teachers and administrators fear the self-interest and confidential issues that parents may bring to meetings with them. One example of a parent&#65533;s hidden agenda was the lowering of academic standards in Kentucky to allow otherwise excluded students to participate in interscholastic sports (Mayhan, 1993). Communication Factors Communication barriers arise when the intent of the message and the content as perceived by the receiver differ, when the honesty of the message is questionable, when the language and cultural gap is large, when there is lack of understanding between parties, or the idea is not accurately communicated to the community (Schaeffer and Betz, 1992). Implementation of plans for increased parent involvement often encounters difficulty due to ineffective communication. After extensive study, McCollum (1996) stated that governance reform needs several years for planning, gradual implementation, and flexible assessment mechanisms; however, clear goals for student outcomes should be documented at the beginning to help keep focus. The gap between written and reality may lead to frustration and failure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">Language barriers further add to the obstacles of successfully involving parents. Often, due to a difference in social class or cultural background, values and language skills, day to day language usage causes difficulties and discomfort between educators and parents. There are five registers of language (frozen, formal, consultative, casual and intimate) and a jump between two levels leads to extreme discomfort (Payne, 1997). Schaeffer and Betz (1992) outline external factors as those including lack of time, busy lifestyles, personal problems, administrative policies, unclear roles, and inadequate training or support. These factors are external to the personal characteristics of individuals, yet have a significant influence over what happens. Parent commitment to parent involvement in local school governance is not stable nor guaranteed. Parent councils have recommended to increase the power for councils whereas teachers, principals and school boards recommend a less powerful role.</paragraph><paragraph parID="39">School Administration Plays a Key Role     Administrator approachability appears to be the key to successful parent involvement in schools. Authentic parent involvement is based on mutual trust and respect. School administration must creatively find time to allow teachers to meet and telephone parents. Both parents and teachers require time together to build trust, effective communication patterns, and mutual respect. Epstein (1995) has outlined six types of parent involvement and administrators should encourage parents to be as involved as they can and accept whatever that may be. Involving Parents is a Component of Teacher Professionalism     Teacher professionalism may be defined as &#65533;the conduct, aims, or qualities that characterize the teaching profession which requires specialized knowledge and long and intensive academic preparation. Parent involvement is a component of the profession and the profession needs to take a stance and educate its members.</paragraph><paragraph parID="40">Some teachers feel threatened or endangered while others feel enhanced by parent involvement. Professionalism is not threatened with increased parent involvement in local school governance, it means adjusting to new partnerships. Educators, working independently, are professionals who now must learn to work interdependently with parents. Educators need to consider parents as assets, not as deficits in schools (Sarason, 1995). Parent interviewees desire increased information and involvement in their children&#65533;s education. Teacher respondents discussed communication tools they use to communicate with parents: student agenda books, weekly letter written by students, tests to be signed by parents, monthly letter and calender of classroom activities, and voice mail. On the basis of this study, it could be inferred that most parents do not wish to govern schools, they simply want more information about the educational programs their children are receiving.</paragraph><paragraph parID="41">Educators need to determine how much time and energy they can take away from the children in the classroom to communicate with parents. One teacher described a risk-taking experience with parents who make it possible to do activities she could not do by herself in the classroom. She expresses her feelings as she had to give up a certain amount of control when having parents in for the first time to help with computers. Often school staffs creatively find time to meet or phone parents. This philosophy encourages teachers to interact with parents about the daily positive happenings in classrooms. The Parents&#65533; Role     Parents have a responsibility to keep informed, ask questions, attend workshops, and borrow resources in order to make sound decisions about their child and the school. One parent stated, &#65533;I don&#65533;t want to know more and be more responsible for more&#65533; (P:2, p. 15).</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">Governance is only a small part of what parents want for their involvement in their child&#65533;s&#65533; education. Parents need to be as involved as they can and others must accept that. Taylor&#65533;s study (1992) found that parents were aware that their participation in school-based decision making could be misinterpreted or misused by other parents. Parents often mistrust community members who are active on councils or other formalized structures. Formalized parent organizations need to work at reducing tension with those in informal roles in schools. Several parent interviewees felt that support groups should be developed to share parenting and schooling successes and difficulties with children. It should be the parents&#65533; responsibility to establish and maintain these groups.</paragraph><paragraph parID="43">Two teacher respondents spoke highly of the volunteer coordinator, who matched parents&#65533; talents with needs in the school. Parent organizations are encouraged to maintain this volunteer position. Formal Training for Parents and Teacher     Teacher respondents identified a need for formal training where parents and teachers can dialogue, define roles, establish a Code of Ethics or standards of behavior, and discuss other relevant issues at school. Inexperienced teachers would appreciate an experienced mentor to guide them through parent involvement dynamics. A component of a university class dealing with community relations, parent involvement, working with parents and school councils should be designed and implemented. The university needs to prepare Education students to work with parents in decision making in classrooms. New teachers need to boost their confidence in communicating and working with parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="44">Recommendations for Future Study     There will be an ongoing need to assess the progress of parent involvement in local school governance, to access the effectiveness of the training of parents, teachers and administrators, and the commitment of the community. Although my intent was not to focus on administration, both teachers and parents stressed the importance of administrative support for parent involvement to be successful. Due to the significant influence of school administrators on parent involvement, the training they receive must be carefully designed. A study about administrators and their thoughts on parent involvement in local school governance will help design effective training workshops. Parent involvement in local school governance in schools differs from rural, urban, and community-designated schools. Experience suggests that the most vocal and best-organized school councils will be found in the middle- and upper-income schools and neighborhoods, where the parents have the time to take an active part in school affairs and the resources to supplement school budgets&#65533; (Dunning, 1995, p. 19). This would provide a model for other schools who are in the process of implementing increased parent involvement in local school governance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="45">After increased parent involvement in local school governance, it would be worthwhile to study its effects in regard to public accountability, student achievement, and community satisfaction several years from now. The benefits in schools, in communities, and in society should be documented to further justify parent involvement in decision making. A study investigating why significant numbers of men choose not to be involved in schools would help design strategies to include them in their children&#65533;s education. My final observation is that all of the parent interviewees suggested by administrators were women. Fathers too have talents and skills to share in schools and local school governance. Research participants describe current parent involvement in education, tensionality along the journey to increase parent involvement in local school governance and support required for parent involvement in local school governance. Teachers and parents are challenged to change from traditional roles to interdependency in new partnerships.</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">The majority of parents in this study do not wish to run schools; they desire meaningful involvement with their children&#65533;s education at school. The research findings suggest that few parents presently desire involvement in local school governance. Most prefer to interact at the classroom level with their children and teachers. With increased parent involvement in local school governance, schools may become more responsive to the needs of children. New relationships develop through meaningful two way communication between home and school, clearly defined parent and teacher roles, and support. Are all administrators aware of the influence they have? Are principals concerned about the welcoming atmosphere in their schools?</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">Insider/outsider tension may be reduced with a welcoming school environment: parent bulletin boards, special coffee room, computer accessibility, resource materials, and invitations to participate in educational activities. The administrator&#65533;s role is to create a welcoming climate and become more open to the community. Principals are considered strong role models for their staffs and they must be aware of the messages they send out. Improved Communication and Interpersonal Relationships     Improved communication and interpersonal relationships between the home and school through an open door policy, surveys, dialogues and meetings should become a priority. New teachers learn how to involve and manage from experienced teachers and administration. There may also be financial implications in school budgets to supplement the limited telephone access presently in schools. New power structures need to be carefully outlined and communicated to all.</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">Individual schools need to look at their community needs to develop their plan for success. Increased involvement will not occur because of legislation. It will be the way individual schools communicate and perform that will determine involvement in local school governance. They would like a synopsis of curriculum and expectations, and more frequent contact with teachers by phone or in person. She explains her episode,&#65533;And I suppose that expanded my horizon a little bit in that I was willing to give up some control and it was really positive&#65533; (T:1, p. 24). This teacher took great risk but the results were positive for all. Through synergy, and thinking win/win healthy relationships develop (Covey, 1989).</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">With the right to be involved in school governance comes a responsibility to the school and children. Everyone wants to uphold the privilege but few want the consequent responsibilities. Other respondents spoke of support groups where they could share successes and receive feedback for perceived failures. I have compiled recommendations for future investigation in this area of study. What is the reality within the diversity of Saskatchewan? I recommend a study of successful councils to learn how they define their roles, determine their goals, and decision-making processes, and what real authority they possess. After several years of increased involvement in local school governance, it would be worthwhile to study its effects in regard to public accountability, student achievement, and community satisfaction.</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">One might expect future SSTA survey results to indicate contentment with education. Tensionalities between home and school will be addressed through the building of trusting relationships. Aronson, Julie Z. (1996, April) How schools can recruit hard-to-reach parents.

(h) REVIEW- The State educational agency shall review the local educational agency's parental involvement policies and practices to determine if the policies and practices meet the requirements of this section. (3) RESERVATION-</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">Parent Involvement Policy The Board of Education believes that positive parental involvement is essential to student achievement, and thus encourages such involvement in school educational planning and operations. The Board directs the Superintendent of Schools to develop a home-school communications program in an effort to encourage all forms of parental involvement. District Level Policy Consistent with the parent involvement goals of Title I, Part A of the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB), the Board of Education will: develop and implement programs, activities and procedures that encourage and support the participation of parents of students eligible for Title I services in all aspects of their child's education. develop and implement programs, activities and procedures that encourage and support the participation of parents of students who are not eligible for Title I services in all aspects of their child's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">The ultimate goal of these programs, activities and procedures is to ensure that all families within the district are provided the same opportunities for involvement in their child's education. The term parents refers to a natural parent, legal guardian or other person standing in loco parentis (such as a grandparent or stepparent with whom the child lives, or a person who is legally responsible for the child's welfare). District and school level parental involvement programs, activities and procedures, including those funded through Title I, Part A funds, will provide full opportunities for the participation of parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities and parents of migratory children. As further required by the NCLB, parents of students eligible for Title I services will be provided an opportunity to participate in the development of the district's Title I plan, and to submit comments regarding any aspect of the plan that is not satisfactory to them. Their comments will be forwarded with the plan to the State Education Department. Parents also will participate in the process for developing a school improvement plan when the school their child attends fails to make adequate yearly progress for two consecutive years and is identified as a school in need of improvement. Six Types of Parent Involvement</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">Parental involvement may take place either in the classroom or during extracurricular activities. However, the Board also encourages parental involvement at home (e.g., planned home reading time, informal learning activities, and/or homework contracts between parents and children). The Board directs the Superintendent of Schools to develop a program that includes the requirements outlined in NCLB in conjunction with the six types of parent involvement as outlined by the National Network of Partnership Schools and endorsed by the National PTA in an effort to encourage all forms of parental involvement. The six types of involvement are: Parenting: Help all families establish home environments to support children as students. Volunteering: Recruit and organize parent help and support. Learning at Home: Provide information and ideas to families about how to help students at home with homework and other curriculum-related activities, decisions and planning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">Decision-Making : Include parents in school decisions, develop parent leaders and representatives. Collaborating with Community : Identify and integrate resources and services from the community to strengthen school programs, family practices and student learning and development. Communication to Parents The Superintendent is authorized and encouraged to develop parent-friendly materials using all or any part of this policy to communicate the policy to all district parents and members of the community and to promote and sustain parent involvement. The goal of these and all communications to parents is to ensure that information related to school and parent-related programs, meetings and other activities is sent to the parents of students, including those participating in Title I programs, in an understandable and uniform format, including alternative formats, upon request, and to the extent practicable, in a language the parents can understand. The Elmira City School District's District Wide Parental Involvement Policy will be made available to all families in written form in each school's main office as well as on the district website. An alternative format, provided in a concise and understandable manner, will be printed and distributed to families within the school district at the beginning of each school year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">Coordination of Parental Involvement Strategies Community Agencies and Programs The District will coordinate and integrate strategies adopted to comply with the NCLB Title I, Part A parental involvement requirements with parental involvement strategies adopted in connection with existing community partners such as the Economic Opportunity Program, Head Start and Chemung County Child Care Council. The district shall demonstrate its compliance with this project by participating both in resource and information sharing as well as in joint initiatives such as the Chemung County School Readiness Project. District Staff Resources The Board recognizes the need to dedicate staff resources to the coordination of the District's parent involvement efforts. Consequently, it has approved the creation of and provided the funding for the position(s) of Parent Partner at each of the District's schools and the district level position of Parent Involvement Liaison.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">The Superintendent has the responsibility of developing and maintaining job descriptions for these positions. Parent Representation Building Planning Teams A minimum of two (2) parent representatives shall be elected by the parents in each school to the Building Planning Team for that school. Every school in the district is required to have a planning team. Parent representatives shall be responsible for communicating with their constituencies and for representing parent opinion on the teams. District Planning Team</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">The District Planning Team shall include three (3) parent representatives. There will be at one parent to respectively represent the District's elementary, middle and secondary schools. Every school in the district will have the opportunity to nominate a parent for appointment. Parent Teacher Organizations Each school will have a parent organization that centers its work on the six types of parent involvement (parenting, communicating, volunteering, learning at home, decision-making, and collaborating with community) that is connected to the work of the Building Planning Team. Principals will work collaboratively with the Parent Partner of their school to develop and sustain a parent organization in their school. This policy in no way eliminates or diminishes an individual parent's right to make his or her feelings known at any level in the district on any topic of concern, nor does it prevent the district from involving individual parents in other appropriate situations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">District Parental Involvement Plan Development The Superintendent shall include within the District's Annual Educational Plan he presents to the Board a separate Parent Involvement sub-section identifying the expected key results, the specific and measurable parent involvement related goals he is recommending and a delineation of those initiatives to be undertaken and/or maintained which seek to ensure that all families within the district are provided the same opportunities for involvement in their child's education. The Board, along with its superintendent of schools and other appropriate district staff will undertake the following actions to ensure parent involvement in the development of this district wide parental involvement plan: These key results, goals and initiatives will be presented to each school building's Building Planning Team (BPT). B. Recommendations from each BPT will be compiled and presented to building administrators and parent organizations within each school building. The final draft plan, incorporating appropriate recommendations, will then be presented at the District Planning Team.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">D. Final presentation to Elmira City School District Board of Education for approval of plan will occur by October 15th of each year. Annual Evaluation The Board, along with its superintendent of schools and other appropriate staff will conduct, with the involvement of parents, an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of the parental involvement plan in improving the academic quality of District schools, including those receiving Title I, Part A funds. This annual evaluation will include the identification of barriers to greater participation by parents in activities under this policy, and the revision of parent involvement policies necessary for more effective involvement. To facilitate this review, the Superintendent will report annually to the Board of Education on the effectiveness of parent involvement. The report will evaluate parental involvement using the measures identified in the key result areas within the Parental Involvement Sub-Section of the District s Annual Educational Plan, the requirements stipulated by NCLB, and the six types of parent involvement as described earlier in this policy. Such reports will be considered by the Board of Education, in determining the necessity for revisions to this policy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">School Level Parental Involvement Plans The superintendent of schools will ensure that all district schools, including those receiving federal financial assistance under Title I, Part A, are provided technical assistance and all other support necessary to assist them in planning and implementing effective parental involvement programs and activities that improve student achievement and school performance in conjunction with the six types of parent involvement outlined earlier in this policy. As appropriate to meet individual local needs, the superintendent will assign a school district parent involvement staff person to assist in the development and communication of parent involvement programs and policies throughout the district. All school level parental involvement plans shall include specifics as to how all school based staff will implement the six types of parental involvement in order to improve student performance. Building Capacity for Parental Involvement One of the prime focuses of the Parental Involvement Plan included within the District's Annual Educational Plan shall be to develop and implement programs, activities and procedures which seek to build parent capacity for strong parental involvement to improve their child's academic achievement, the district and its schools, including those receiving Title I, Part A funds. Consequently, the Annual Educational Plan will be expected to include:</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">The provision of activities such as workshops, classes, and materials whose goal is to assist parents in understanding such topics as the state s academic content and student achievement standards, state and local academic assessments, Title I requirements, how to monitor their child's progress and how to work with educators to improve the achievement of their child. The inclusion of building specific plans to provide materials and training to help parents work with their child's academic achievement. The development of training opportunities for teachers, pupil services personnel, principals, and other staff in understanding the value and utility of a parent's contributions and on how to: Implement the six areas of parental involvement Reach out to, communicate with, and work with parents as equal partners ensure that all of its schools including those receiving Title I, Part A funds develop and implement school level parental involvement policies. Communicating: Design effective forms of school-to-home and home-to-school communications about school programs and children s progress.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">High school parent involvement: Relationships with achievement, grade level, SES, and gender. Parent involvement: Contributions of teacher efficacy, school socioeconomic status, and other school characteristics. California's policy on parent involvement: State leadership for local initiatives. Attitudes of secondary principals, teachers, parents, and students toward parent involvement in the schools. "Parent involvement" and "parent participation" are nebulous terms because there is an array of parent behaviors that these could include. To define parent involvement more operationally, Hoover-Dempsey, Bassler, and Brissie (1987) theorized a two-way breakdown into home-based activities (e.g., parent home tutoring) and school based parent involvement activities (e.g., parent volunteering, attendance at parent-teacher conferences). Similar typologies have been discussed by Cervone and O'Leary (1982) and Hester (1989).</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">Epstein (1988), in a slightly different approach, described five types of parent involvement: (a) "Basic Obligation of Parents" includes parents providing for the health and safety of their children as well as preparing their children for school; (b) "Basic Obligation of the Schools" includes the school communicating with parents about school programs and the progress of children; (c) "Parent Involvement at School," the volunteering of parents in the classroom and attendance at school performances or sports events; (d) "Parent Involvement in Learning Activities in the Home" parents initiating activities with their child or a child initiating the help through questions; (e) "Parent Involvement in Governance and Advocacy" the parents assuming decision making roles. Much of this research focuses on the elementary school program. However, there has been some research focusing on the secondary school level (Dornbusch and Ritter, 1988; Henderson et al., 1986; Hickman, Greenwood, &amp; Miller, 1995; Thornburg, 1981). In addition, this law mandates that the SACs be evaluated for their effectiveness by the school board each year (Greenwood, Breivogel, &amp; Jester, 1977). comprehensive programs of parent involvement require schools to involve parents at all grade levels in a variety of roles. All parents are a vast resource which can be tapped to increase student learning. Another strategy is to have the students routinely carry home assignments and material to their parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">Athletic events, school plays, or musicals are wonderful opportunities for parents to support their children at school. Harvard Family Research Project's (HFRP) Family Involvement Research Digests summarize research written and published by non-HFRP authors and/or written by HFRP authors but published by organizations other than HFRP. To learn more about the research summarized in this digest, please contact the authors at at the addresses below . Many studies have examined types of parent involvement and their effect on student learning and behavior; only a few, however, have studied the factors that motivate parents to become involved (Lanthier, Wright-Cunningham &amp; Edmonds, 2003; Reed, Jones, Walker &amp; Hoover-Dempsey, 2000). Hoover-Dempsey &amp; Sandler (1995, 1997) identified three critical factors as determinants of parent involvement: (1) parents' role construct (that is, their beliefs about their need to be involved in their child's education), (2) parents' sense of self-efficacy-that they have the knowledge and skills to be involved, and (3) school invitations. Before parents participated in the program, our data, based on a presurvey of participating parents, confirmed the importance of role construct as a primary predictor of parent involvement. A sample of 1,156 parents from 20 California schools was surveyed before and after participating in a 9-week education program offered in the winter of 2002.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">The surveys included 31 items that assessed seven areas related to parent involvement: (1) home learning activities (e.g., reading to child), (2) parenting practices (e.g., praising child), (3) home-school connections (e.g., attending PTA meetings), (4) parents' knowledge (e.g., knowing academic standards), (5) sense of self-efficacy (e.g., able to help child be successful in school), (6) parental role construction (e.g., parents believe they have to be involved in child's education), and (7) college expectations (e.g., expect child to go to university). The analysis included two phases: (1) determining effect sizes to know how much the program influenced parents' knowledge, beliefs, and actions, and (2) structural equation modeling &#178; to determine the pathways (factors) by which Latino parents become involved at the elementary and secondary levels (Slaughter-Defoe &amp;amp; Brown, 1998). A significant difference in parent knowledge, beliefs, and practices was found after parents attended the 9-week parent education program. The program had a significant effect on most parent involvement factors, especially on parents' knowledge (1.06 elementary and .89 secondary). The short duration of the program may be one reason for the minimal effect on home-school connections, which did not allow for opportunities for the school or teachers to change their practices and invitations. Knowledge gained in the program is the strongest predictor of Latino parent involvement with their elementary-aged children after participating in the program. A possible explanation may be found in the program content, which strongly stresses the importance of positive parenting practices and encourages parents to support the social-emotional development of their child as well as to engage in home learning activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">Chrispeels and Rivero (2001) previously found that after participating in this education program, parents reported dramatic changes in their parenting behaviors, such as praising their child, engaging in less physical punishment for mistakes, and establishing rules and limits to television viewing, which supported more time for learning activities. The direct path from home-school connections to college expectations may depend on school invitations and may also require a longer time frame for parents to meet with school counselors and attend college prep meetings. &#185; The parenting program is offered by the Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE), a nonprofit group than began in San Diego, California, in 1987, with the specific purpose of helping Latino and other immigrant parents learn about the American educational system, how to interact schools and teachers, and how to help their children at home. The Board shall schedule agenda time during each regular meeting to encourage public input and to respond to citizens' concerns. The Board shall encourage schools to maintain a policy of openness with and welcome to its community members. The Board shall promote the concept that parents have the right and responsibility to communicate with the school on issues affecting their children's education. The Board shall invite comments on proposed policy during the course of the policy development and prior to adoption.</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">The Board shall encourage and support home and school associations and parental participation and involvement in school activities. The Board has the dual responsibility for implementing statutory requirements pertaining to public education and responding to the community's expectations and values as they pertain to the education of children. Trustees, as elected representatives, are provided with authority under the School Act to exercise their best judgement in determining policies, making decisions and approving procedures for carrying out the responsibility. Have effective communication systems in place that inform staff and community about the efforts and progress of the school system as well as obtain feedback and progress of the school system as well as obtain feedback and input from the various stakeholders on relevant issues. The Board therefore reaffirms its intent to: Have effective communication systems in place that inform staff and community about the efforts and progress of the school system as well as obtain feedback and progress of the school system as well as obtain feedback and input from the various stakeholders on relevant issues. The quality we now impart to childhood is probably a close measure of the quality of our present and future welfare, as an ever expanding community of beings on an ever contracting planet. While no single institutions can guarantee a bright and fruitful childhood for every child, we believe it morally incumbent upon our schools, in cooperation with parents to do everything within their legitimate means and power to guide each student toward constructive self-fulfilment and responsible citizenship, with due respect for his individual way of getting there.</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">indicate supports in place that provide an opportunity for teachers and parents to spend time together sharing perspectives and learning new skills. If, for example, parents are to be more involved in classrooms ,then teachers will need skills to work with volunteers and be prepared to work effectively with them maintain a balance between giving permission for encouraging involvement, and providing protection for students. Creating effective policy through a dynamic process is the key to successfully extending the learning community. It is important to include parents and other members of the community when developing a policy on parent involvement. Before policy development begins, listen carefully to any concerns or ideas expressed by parents about parent involvement in the school or the community. Explain to the students, teachers, and parents that such a policy will contribute to the quality of education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">Explain the process that will be used to develop the policy, and provide examples of the kinds of ideas that the policy is directed toward. Involve as many different groups and individuals as you can. Consult with other boards of education which have developed similar policies. Periodically assess the plan and make adjustments to the process as required. The policy might also include suggestions and examples to assist others in taking action based on the policy. The importance of encouraging parents, families, and communities to be involved in the education of our children cannot be underestimated. Encouraging and welcoming the active support of parents in education extends into the wider communities for communities are made up of families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">Parents may have concerns at different levels. For example: Individual If an individual parent has a personal concern about a particular instance involving their child, it is most appropriate to approach the teacher or principal directly to discuss concerns. Parent Group Involvement regarding broader issues such as curriculum, school climate or policies regarding behaviour, are most appropriately handled through a parent group. The importance of having a parent group cannot be understated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">The objective of the parent group can vary from school to school; however, the underlying objective should be the well-being of all students. A strong parent group can: create and maintain good communication between students, parents and teachers support the school, helping to improve the quality of education identify needs of the particular school and communicate concerns and recommendations to the school board inform parents of new ideas in education encourage and expand community involvement in educational affairs</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">utilize the resources of the community to support new programs raise funds to be used for the betterment of the school, families and community coordinate volunteer efforts Parent involvement must or should be encouraged; but all involvement whether individual or part of a group must be governed by a parent's code of ethics (Appendix C). When planning for involvement, it is important to recognize barriers. The following barriers have been identified by educators and parents in Saskatchewan. Lack of time and opportunity</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">Poor communication between school and home Fear of conflict/intimidation experienced by parents and teachers Superficial, unauthentic involvement Personal circumstances of parents Lack of perceived value in parental contributions Uncooperative administrators Unclear expectations</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">Student pressure: "Not cool" for parents to be involved Lack of informative feedback on student performance Defensiveness on the part of both teachers and parents Past negative experiences in school Educators do not know how to involve parents in education--curricular decisions, instructional plans, school management issues or support at home. A repeated theme in the Ferr&#65533; study (Saskatchewan, 1992) is that of educators protecting their professional role by believing that the role of parents is that of receiving information once decisions are made. On the other hand, parents surveyed by Ferr&#65533; believe that they should be able to provide suggestions to teachers before decisions are made in addition to being kept informed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">"Parents seeking more input into decision-making are stymied by teachers who perceive their autonomy, turf, and professionalism, are being challenged." (National Coalition of Advocates for Student Board of Enquiry, cited in Fraser, 1988, p. 47; Ferr&#65533;, 1992) A substantial barrier to parent involvement that is more than token and moves into parents as partners is perhaps the firmly rooted belief that education is best run by professionals rather than as a democratic process that involves all parties with a vested interest. "Parents are like shareholders in a company without the opportunity to attend the shareholders' meeting." (Parent, Ferr&#65533; Study, 1992) Addressing Barriers Ferr&#65533; (1992) suggests that "educators may wish to make an effort to examine, and further, to reduce the professionalism barriers that are sometimes used to obstruct parental involvement in certain educational matters."</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">Ferr&#65533; (1992) further suggests, implications for further practice to reduce barriers might include: Boards of Education may consider inviting parents to express their views and offer suggestions regarding the educational programs within school divisions; Central office administrations may consider encouraging parent-school communication throughout their school divisions; Central office administration may consider exploring feasible ways of soliciting parent suggestions in certain areas of decision-making; Policy examples from across Canada illustrate ways in which school boards have addressed the challenge of overcoming barriers to parent involvement through policy leadership while providing the necessary framework on which schools can build. For example, a Saskatchewan school has a school level program aimed at enhancing the partnership with parents. This school has identified five levels of school and parent cooperation (an outline of the entire program can be found in Appendix B.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">Parents support conditions at home that support learning; support programs and workshops Exploring program options Playing games together Sharing school news All of these things indicate to the child that the parent is interested in school and thinks that it is important. More specifically, parent involvement can be categorized in the following way: (Epstein, 1989): Parenting would include such things as providing for physical and emotional needs, discipline, a climate that nurtures the development of self-esteem and social skills, self-esteem, social skills, security, understanding, providing well balanced meals and making sure that the child gets enough sleep.</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Providing a healthy, stable environment enables children to get the most from their education. This would include things such as reading newsletters at home, attending parent/teacher conferences, commenting on students' work when it is sent home, talking to teachers and school when "challenges" arise and when good things are happening, and enquiring about school activities. Volunteering includes driving for class trips, helping at school, chaperoning dances, working in the library, being a room parent, doing photocopying or fundraising, flooding the hockey rink or tying skates, warming up the computers in the classroom, or providing an opportunity for work experience in the community. Learning at Home This would include things like helping with homework and projects, arranging educational family trips and outings, reading to children regularly, and playing games together. Advocating for and with Other Parents Representing other parents includes being on the Parent/Teacher Association or Home and School Association, being a member of an advisory council or committee, working with an independent advocacy group or being a local or division board member.</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">Parents must be allowed to pursue involvement in ways that are appropriate to their needs. The development of policies and guidelines for involving parents in school matters could involve both educator and parent representation and participation; Roles for parents in school decision-making should be made clear to parents and educators; Teachers guide and assist parents so they can coordinate home learning activities with school instruction. The school offers homework support and other services to assist parents in helping their children succeed. The school involves and trains parents and community in decision-making as well as in school governance. The Board of Education strongly supports the connection between parental involvement and student learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">It believes that if parental involvement is connected to student learning, there will be a resultant growth in student achievement. Topics to be addressed at this meeting shall include but not be restricted to the following: (a) Classroom expectations. (b) Curriculum to be covered during the course of the year. (c) Instructional and evaluation strategies to be used and an explanation of those strategies. (d) A discussion of how parents can support the instructional and extracurricular programs in the school. The Board believes that continuous communication with parents, related to curriculum and instruction and how parents can help their children in school, is important during the course of the school year. The following framework supports such communication.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">(a) Teachers shall, during the course of the year, keep parents informed of the topics and themes being taught in the classroom and how parents can help with those topics or themes at home. (b) Teachers should, from time to time, host workshops during the school year to help parents become familiar with new teaching strategies and curriculum initiatives. (c) Teachers shall provide the opportunity for parents to have contact with them more frequently than during formal parent/teacher/student interviews to discuss such topics as how a student could benefit by cooperation between home and school. Class newsletters or teacher newsletters to parents are strongly encouraged. (e) Parents are encouraged to contact their child(ren)'s teacher(s) throughout the school year. Extending the Learning Community: Involving Parents and Families in Schools is the product of many meetings of many minds: Ms. Betty Reynolds, Trustee, Saskatoon East Mr. David Fineday, Parent, Saskatoon Ms. Dawn Mutch, Executive Director, Saskatoon-Dundurn Community Resource, Dundurn Ms. Gillian McCreary, Saskatchewan Education, Training and Employment, Regina Ms. Sandy Pearson, Principal, Saskatoon East Ms. Edith Nagy, Saskatchewan Education, Training and Employment, Regina Ms. Karen Anderson, Principal, Saskatoon East Mr. Pat Donegan, Saskatchewan Teachers Federation, Saskatoon Mrs. Joy Bastness, Federation of Home and School Associations, Hagen Mr. Bob Reid, Trustee, Saskatoon Ms. Meryl Wood, Federation of Home and School Associations, Saskatoon Mr. John Barton, Principal, Saskatoon Prudence Owusu-Ansah, Community Coordinator, Saskatoon Extending the Learning Community: Involving Parents and Families in Schools is a resource for educators and school boards wishing to encourage parent and family involvement in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">"A Review of Directions" (Saskatchewan Education, Training and Employment, 1992) recommends that : All schools in the province should develop strategies to expand parent and community involvement in education as one of the key elements of their school improvement plans. These strategies could build on existing structures by more effectively involving parent groups, local boards and advisory councils. Strategies to improve parent and community involvement should promote active participation in setting school goals, introducing program changes and enhancing learning activities for students at home, in the community and during school hours. The models focused on such topics as "active parenting" (training sessions for parents), "new parents as teachers" (a program for teenage parents), "operation fail-safe" (parent-student-teacher conferences to raise student achievement), and "family math" (a program for parent and students to work together on math). Research shows us that time and again, children's attitudes towards school, their achievement, attendance, motivation, self-concept, and behaviors are directly influenced by the attitudes of their parents towards learning and school. For at-risk students, parent and family involvement in learning has been identified as the single most important determinant of success.</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">Actively involving schools, families and community members in identifying issues, assessing the needs of the community, and developing solutions makes for more effective schools that can better meet the needs and expectations of its community. "Our findings show parent involvement in the life of the school to be a positive influence upon pupils' programs and development. The headteacher's accessibility to parents was also important; schools operating an informal, open-door policy being more effective. Parent involvement in pupils' educational development within the home was also clearly beneficial. The growth in the number of students in private schools and the burgeoning interest in charter and home-based education also indicate that parents and families are becoming more interested and concerned about public schooling. Parents report little involvement at the school itself. Many parents work full- or part-time and cannot come to the school building during the school day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">Parents in all of the schools in the sample were empathetic in wanting the schools and teachers to advise them about how to help their own children at home at each grade level. Parents believe that the schools need to strengthen practices such as giving parents specific information on their children's major academic subjects and what their children are expected to learn each year. Parents of young children and better educated parents conducted more activities at home that support their children's schooling. Parents who are guided by teachers on how to help at home spend more minutes helping their children with homework than other parents. Most important for policy and practice, parents' level of involvement is directly linked to the specific practices of the school that encourage involvement at school and guide parents in how to help at home. "Parents were aware of and responded positively to teachers' efforts to involve them in learning activities at home. Parents with children in the classrooms of teachers who built parent involvement into their regular teaching practice were more aware of teachers' efforts, received more ideas from teachers, knew more about their child's instructional program, and rated the teachers higher on interpersonal skills and overall teaching quality.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">Sharing facilities and resources within communities, drawing on the ideas and energy of all community and family members, and by involving volunteers are a few of the ways schools are making the best use of limited resources. Parent, family and community involvement in education is a key priority for Saskatchewan Education, Training and Employment. While this strategy was formally announced in Policy Directions for Secondary Education in Saskatchewan, the Minister's Response to the High School Review Advisory Committee Final Report, there has been a move toward greater family and community involvement in education in Saskatchewan over the last number of years. Curriculum Initiatives -- Curriculum initiatives such as granting students credit for out-of-school personal learning initiatives, locally modified and developed courses that include community content and focus, and the development of the career/community explorations course take the classroom into the community and bring the community into the classroom. Increased parent, family and community involvement is a key objective of the program and many schools have developed community partnerships as well as partnerships with First Nations reserves for funding and program and resource development and implementation. Parents, families and community members are involved in all aspects of the school program. Saskatchewan Education, Training and Employment is committed to developing a policy statement and implementation strategy for enhanced parent, family and community involvement in education that facilitates their participation in setting school goals, introducing program changes, solving problems and enhancing learning activities for students at home, in the school and in the community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">Encourage good health practices by making sure your child has three nutritious meals a day, gets plenty of exercise and sleep, and has regular medical and dental check-ups. Instill self-confidence by encouraging your child to believe in his or her self-worth and abilities. Monitor how your child spends his or her time outside of school. Limit video games and television viewing and encourage reading, hobbies, scouts, and other worthwhile activities that provide learning opportunities. Make sure your child attends school regularly, show an interest in what is being learned at school, and communicate that education is important. Belief in the value of hard work, personal responsibility, and the importance of education all contribute to greater success in school. Be a role model for your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">Children imitate what they see their parents doing. If you read, your child will want to read. Homeworking, an excellent resource that is full of ideas, is published by The Metropolitan Toronto School Board. From Policy to Planning at the School Level Planning for Parent and Family Involvement (Dobber &amp; Epstein) Assess current strengths and weaknesses to determine the appropriate starting point for developing comprehensive programs. Identify new and attainable goals for teachers, administrators, and parents; and identify the teams, committees, or individuals responsible for gauging progress toward those goals.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">Evaluate programs in terms of their goals and report findings to constituent groups. Support program development will continue with attention and assistance. Encouraging Involvement at the School Level Make parent involvement a schoolwide effort. Teachers and administrators must be committed to parent involvement, and staff enthusiasm stimulates greater parent participation. Provide interesting and timely information about upcoming events and activities. Reminder notices and telephone calls provide additional encouragement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">Maintain a warm and friendly school environment where parents feel comfortable, needed, and respected. Student interest generates parent interest. Students can make personal invitations, plan activities, and serve as hosts. Make your outreach efforts contagious by involving as many parents, teachers, students, administrators, and community members as possible. Schedule activities for the convenience of parents, not schools. Communicate frequently with parents through a brief phone call or note. Provide parents with many opportunities to discuss their children's interests and achievements.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">And acknowledge those achievements. Parents like to see their children succeed. Suggest home activities that extend the natural relationship between parents and children and provide opportunities for family interaction in ways that are educationally interesting and meaningful. Call frequently with brief messages of good news to convey the idea that a call from school is not just about problems. One call a day means 190 calls through the year. Approach parents with a nonjudgemental attitude to discover reasons for noninvolvement. Sometimes parents just need information and encouragement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">Consider home visits, especially for parents who, for whatever reason, do not come to school. Hold parent meetings in locations other than the school--homes, churches, or community centers for parents who may be intimidated by the school environment. Enlist parents in a telephone tree to spread the word about special school activities and projects. Schools can link families in need of social services to agencies about which they might not be aware. Become involved in such neighbourhood projects as day care, health, and recreation to demonstrate to parents that the school cares about issues affecting their welfare. Provide child care and transportation for special events and activities. Do not give up on any parent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">Be patient with parents. Some may be reluctant to get involved due to any number of reasons. Recognize parents for their efforts: happygrams, certificates, awards, thank-you letters, end-of-year celebrations, phone calls.

Efforts to involve families and community members cover a continuum of involvement activities with an increasing level of collaboration and shared responsibility and authority. There are many ways, with varying degrees of responsibility and authority, that parents and community members can be involved in education. The type of involvement and level of responsibility will vary from school to school depending on the needs of the community, wishes, ability and willingness of parents, families, and community members, values and resources. Parents, family and community members play significant roles in the lives of children and their involvement in education is important for several reasons including: enhancing children's opportunities for success in school and in life;</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">strengthening the capacity of schools to provide quality education services which meet the needs and expectations of the community by actively involving students, families and community members in identifying issues, assessing the needs of the community, and developing solutions; encouraging the commitment and support of all members of the community including families, social and human service agencies that is needed to effectively address barriers to learning; responding to public demand for a stronger voice in education planning and decision-making; and making the best use of limited resources by sharing facilities and resources within communities. Where parents are actively involved in schools: Student performance is improved (Snodgrass, 1991) Student attitudes and self-concept are more positive (Henderson, 1987)</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">Student dropout rates are lower (Peterson, 1989) Student absenteeism is decreased (Tangri and Moles, 1987) Suspension rates are lower (Christenson and Cleary, 1990) Opportunities for at-risk students improve (Stallings and Stipek, 1986) Student, teacher and parent perceptions of classroom climate are more positive (Haynes, Comer and Hamilton-Lee, 1989) Teachers indicate greater satisfaction with their work (Christenson and Cleary, 1990) Parents are more understanding of school issues (Christenson and Cleary, 1990)</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">Schools are rated as more effective (Epstein, 1988) Parent involvement also: Provides feedback to the school from the community Encourages positive parent-teacher-student relations and three way communication Shows support for the teacher and the school and the importance of education Promotes participation in the school Provides an opportunity for children to feel supported and confident in their role as a "student"</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">Creates a more informed community In recent studies of the public opinions related to schools, "parents" of students were one of the most supportive and positive groups. Groups that had no relation or connection to schools were the most critical of schools today. When parents are involved in their children's classrooms, they are more supportive of the teachers and the school. They are more positive and less fearful. They see the realities of today's schools, and become familiar with new curricula and teaching methods. Parents can support what they understand.</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">Teachers can benefit from the insights of the parent and parents can benefit from the insights of the teacher. Ultimately, involvement means that the child benefits. Parents and Schooling in the 1990s (Flaxman &amp; Enger, 1991) indicated five primary principles that apply to parent involvement in schools: Involving parents in their children's education improves student achievement and behavior, but parent involvement is most effective when it is comprehensive, well planned, and long-lasting. There are strong, positive effects from involving parents continuously through high school. Children from low income and minority families benefit greatly when schools involve parents. This resource document provides information necessary to create policy that involves parents and family members in schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">School board policy serves several functions. Policy development is best viewed as a change process. At the classroom and school level, parent and community involvement may be occurring because individual teachers or the school staff are exploring new, promising practices. However, individual efforts cannot succeed over time without supportive school board policy leadership. The challenge for school systems lies in implementing and institutionalising effective approaches in all schools. Effective policy leadership is a way of taking effective practice and making it available for all students in all schools. Writing a new policy does not guarantee change in practice or parent support.</paragraph><paragraph parID="115">Policy leadership requires the combined efforts of trustees, students, teachers and the community. This will be more likely to happen if policy development is treated as a process - an opportunity to begin an ongoing dialogue with the community - rather than as an end in itself. The process of developing the policy may be more important than the policy itself for it is the process that develops awareness, interest, and ownership. Ideal parent and family involvement varies with each school community; there is no one right answer. Parent involvement develops over time as an integral part of a school improvement or restructuring strategy, rather than a remedial intervention. The benefits of parent involvement are not confined to early childhood or the elementary grades. Parents do not have to be well educated themselves in order to help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="116">The resulting policy then reflects commonly understood and supported practice. An effective policy provides the vision--clear direction--with room for choice in the actions taken. The emphasis is on achieving a successful outcome rather than mandating the vehicle that will take you there. The process used to develop the policy is the first step in creating a climate that encourages openness and fosters a positive approach. Policy that is developed behind closed doors, then laid on will do little to model or encourage the attitude that is needed to open the school to the wider community. The classroom has the potential to be an isolated island--opening the door is an important step. Knowing your community, the current situation, and having vision provides the base for a policy that increases involvement within the unique context of your community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">Throughout the document and appendix you will find ideas that have worked for others. They may be inspirational as your policy process begins. Shirley Adams is always at the school. She helps in the library. She is the room mother for all of her children. She drives for any class trip. The Browns talk to their children at home about school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">They look at their homework. They sign report cards. They can be counted on to turn up at parent-teacher interviews. Ann Blake works full-time. She doesn't have time to come to the school. And she needs support herself, for raising her three young children on her own. However, she has talked with her employer about the importance of family and community partnerships in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">Her employer often contributes surplus resources to the school and encourages work experience placements. Every once in a while Mr. Smith storms in and demands to know why his child was kept after school. After a few stormy sessions, Mr. Smith can also be counted on to help with special events and programs. The Johnson children used to come to school sporadically. Some days they were late. Some days they were hungry; some days they were tired. Since Gramma moved in the children attend much more regularly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">The family makes use of the breakfast program and the school's clothing depot. Consider these brief case studies as they relate to the following continuum: Some parents involve themselves in their children's educations in other ways, outside of the public system. Mr. and Mrs. Smith have decided to move their children to a private school in the area. They feel that the private school offers a better education for their children. The Jones children are educated at home. Involvement takes many different forms and means different things to different people.</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">"Today I helped out in my son's kindergarten class. I helped children print their stories, cleared the craft table, fetched the film projector, baked a cake and served it, kept the activities area stocked, and helped children get dressed at recess. I talked to the teacher about my son's interest in building a playhouse, and followed up on comments made on his report card. Today I also followed up on a proposal made to our local school board for an alternative program for primary-aged children. Later in the day I met with other parents interested in organizing a community spring festival. My son and I also read stories after visiting the library today. We emptied his backpack and went over the things he brought home from kindergarten.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">This case study illustrates several ways in which a parent might be involved in their child's education. Reading stories and books together Teachers are asked to present parents with options as frequently as possible. Parents and/or legal guardians shall be welcomed to observe their child's class in accordance with an appropriate procedure which protects the learning atmosphere for all students. Parents and/or legal guardians wishing to observe their children in the elementary classrooms should discuss the reasons for the visitation with the teacher where possible at least 24 hours in advance of the visit. Parents and/or legal guardians wishing to observe their children in the secondary classroom should discuss the reasons for the visit with the Principal where possible at least 24 hours in advance of the visit. The Board of Education believes in the involvement of parents and other interested members of the community in the operation of their school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">Parents of students attending a school may establish School Councils for that purpose. The decision to establish a School Council shall be made at an open parent meeting by a majority vote of the parents present. The Principal of each school shall call a general meeting of the parents of students attending the school for the purpose of establishing a School Council. Notice of the meeting, including the purpose and time of the meeting, shall be shared with parents using available channels of communication. Parents of students attending the school must comprise the majority of members on that School Council. I.

Parent Involvement Policy Development Worksheet How would you involve the Board of Education? How would you keep them informed of feedback received from individuals and groups?</paragraph><paragraph parID="132">How would you use the process of developing a parent involvement policy to educate students, teachers, parents and community members as well as to get their input concerning the policy? What aspects of your plan might need to be adapted as you proceed with the development of the parent involvement policy? What is the first thing you would do after the final version of the parent involvement policy was formally adopted by the Board? Parent visitation days, with invitations designed and written by the children, provide a way to acquaint parents with the school's program and services. Assisting teachers with special classroom activities and projects, such as bookmaking, science experiments, cooking, field trips, etc. Using parents' special talents and expertise to enrich the curriculum. Assisting with band, chorus, drama, and other programs in the arts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="133">Helping supervise and direct before- and after-school programs for children. Assisting with the organization and supervision of grade-level or schoolwide projects, such as a read-a-thon, book fair, meet-the-author program, book-swap, reading carnival, and ice cream social/awards night. Talk with your child about daily events and take time to listen to what your child wants to tell you. Conversation around the dinner table about everyday and world events promotes learning. Read aloud to your child often--every day if possible--and encourage your child to read to you. The best way to help children become better readers is to begin to read to them when they are infants. The more children read, both in school and outside, the more they will improve their reading abilities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="134">And take your child to the library to get his or her own library card. Encourage children to draw and scribble stories at home. This will help them learn to write with greater confidence in school. Take your child to new and different places, such as museums, historical sites, and nature centers. Talk about what you have seen. Supervise television viewing. Choose good programs and set some time limits--and talk with your children about the programs they do watch.</paragraph><paragraph parID="135">Be generous in showing affection and express interest in your child's everyday activities and accomplishments. Establish a regular time and place for doing homework, encourage your child's efforts, and offer praise when assignments are completed.

Parents play a significant role in their students achievement. Saginaw Public Schools parent involvement model is designed to improve student achievement by making parents and families full partners in the educational process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">Each SPS school has developed its own parent involvement plan under the direction of Natalie Jansorn, Director of Program Development for the National Network of Partnership Schools at Johns Hopkins University. These parent, family and community involvement plans are based on the model developed by Joyce Epstein, Director of the National Network of Partnership Schools. The Epstein Model Here is a brief description of the Six Types of Involvement in the Epstein Model: PARENTING : Assist families with parenting and child-rearing skills, understanding child and adolescent development, and setting home conditions that support children as students at each grade level. COMMUNICATING : Communicate with families about school programs and student progress through effective school-to-home and home-to-school communications. VOLUNTEERING : Improve recruitment, training, work and schedules to involve families as volunteers and audiences a the school or in other locations to support students and student programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">LEARNING AT HOME : Involve families with their children in learning activities at home, including homework and other curriculum related activities and decisions. DECISION-MAKING : Include families as participants in school decisions, governance, and advocacy through PTA/PTO, school councils, committee, action teams, and other parent organizations. COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY : Coordinate community resources and services for students, families, and the school with businesses, agencies, and other groups, and provide services to the community.

One of the main tenets of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Action is parents' participation in decision making related to their children's education. However, despite legislative support for parental involvement, little information has been available until now to examine the actual level of family support for education that is given to middle- and high-school-age students with disabilities. To what extent do families of secondary-school-age students with disabilities engage in activities at home and at school that support their children's educational development?</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">The National Longitudinal Transition Study-2 (NLTS2) provides the first national picture of the involvement of families in the educational development of their secondary-school-age children with disabilities. It has a nationally representative sample of more than 11,000 students who were 13 through 16, receiving special education, and in at least seventh grade when they were sampled in 2000. Descriptive findings are weighted to represent youth with disabilities nationally as a group, as well as youth in each of the 12 federal special education disability categories used in NLTS2. Please see the NLTS2 website ( www.nlts2.org ) for details about the NLTS2 design, sample, analysis approach, and measurement issues. Most families report regularly talking with their children about school (80%) and helping with homework at least once a week (76%). One in five families provide homework assistance as often as five or more times per week. Students with disabilities are more likely to receive help with homework than are their peers in the general population.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">The difference in homework support is especially apparent for those who receive frequent help; students with disabilities are five times as likely as their peers in the general population to receive homework assistance frequently. Only 4% of secondary school students in the general population receive help with homework five or more times a week, compared with 21% of youth with disabilities who receive homework assistance that often. At the other end of the homework-help spectrum-students who rarely receive help-students in the general population are almost twice as likely as those with disabilities to receive homework assistance never or rarely. Involvement in the Individualized Education Program Process Participation in the development of their children's Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a type of family-school partnership specific to families of students with disabilities who qualify for special education services. Student and Family Characteristics Associated With Family Involvement Several characteristics of students with disabilities and their families are related to the levels of family participation in their children's educational development, when controlling for other differences using multivariate analysis techniques. Parents can receive this information through regular communication with teachers regarding topics such as material covered in class, how homework should be completed, and teacher expectations for adequate performance, yet researchers have found that fewer than half of schools report offering parents of students with disabilities weekly or monthly information about curriculum or instruction (Schiller et al., 2003). Targeted outreach (e.g., teacher invitations) may be particularly necessary for parents of students with emotional disturbances or mental retardation, along with additional efforts to include these children in school-based events and activities that bring families to schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">Horry County Schools- Parent Involvement Policy Page 2/5 The services include Adult Education, Parenting, PACT, and Early Childhood. 335 Four Mile Rd. | PO Box 260005 | Conway, SC 29528 Officials will meet Wednesday, February 15, 2012 from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM at 1701 Mountain Industrial Boulevard, Stone Mountain, GA 30083 to assess technology needs in the classroom and offices before applying for grants, including federal E-Rate funds, to make upgrades.

It is most important that parents support their child's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">This support fosters increased student achievement. In an effort to bring continuity to parental involvement, the School Improvement has made one of its primary goals that of ensuring that strategies are in place to build a cohesive and effective partnership with all stakeholders to support academic achievement. To accomplish and foster this goal, continuous parenting classes are offered to the parents through each of the district's parent resource centers [ http://www.dekalb.k12.ga.us/parent-resource-centers ] . Moreover, to build the bridge of partnership between home and community, a parent resource centers [ http://www.dekalb.k12.ga.us/parent-resource-centers ] advisory council has been established. Annual, title I county-wide parental involvement conferences and college financial aid workshops are held in the fall and spring of every school year. The Board of Education [ http://www.dekalb.k12.ga.us/board-of-education ] believes that the public schools belong to the people who create them by consent and taxation and are only as strong as the informed and knowledgeable support of DeKalb County residents and the school system's staff. This support is based upon their knowledge and understanding of and participation in the development of the goals and objectives of the public schools, the district, and school level parental involvement policy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">We, therefore, affirm and assure the right of parents of children participating in activities funded by Title I, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), to opportunities (including but not limited to action teams, strategic planning committees, community meetings, parent workshops, surveys, and questionnaires) to collaboratively participate in: the design and implementation and evaluation of the DeKalb County School District plan including parental involvement activities as stipulated under section 1112 of ESEA the development and revision of parental involvement policy at the district and school level to insure the implementation of activities that are beneficial to all parents as stipulated under section 1112 of ESEA The DeKalb County School District insures that the expectation of parents set at the local school are clearly established and distributed to parents of participating students when they are enrolled in Title I funded activities. The DeKalb County School District Title I office assists in coordination of and provides technical assistance to each Title I eligible school as needed to ensure the effective planning and implementation of parental involvement coordinator, other Title I staff members, and other appropriate support personnel within and outside the DeKalb County School District. Since Title I focuses on building a greater capacity for parental involvement, the DeKalb County School District will maintain the following principles that should build both school and parent capacity for parental involvement. These principles will be accomplished through training and instruction of both parents and educators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">Provisions for such training and instruction for each of these principles may occur via community meetings, parent workshops, brochures, and other media or avenue of learning that is appropriate for the information to be conveyed. The DeKalb County School District understands that we as educators bear the responsibility of helping parents understand federal and state policies and objectives concerning their children's education. DeKalb County School District Title I and the local school parental involvement programs assist participating parents in acquiring an understanding of the following national education goals to the extent applicable or feasible: state Title I content standards and student performance standards school improvement and corrective action process components of a schoolwide program components of a targeted assistance program</paragraph><paragraph parID="199">state and local assessments requirements for Title I "Part A" ways parents can monitor their children's progress and work with educators to improve the performance of their children ways parents can participate in decisions relating to the education of their children The DeKalb County School District and local school parent involvement programs, to the extent feasible and applicable, provide materials and training such as, but not limited to, the coordination of literacy training from other sources to help parents work with their children to improve their children's achievement and direct training in the areas outlined in the previous item. DeKalb County School District Title I program educates teachers, pupil service personnel, principals, and other staff, with the assistance of parents, in the value and utility of contributions of parents and in ways to reach out to, communicate, and work with parents as equal partners, implement and coordinate parent programs, and build ties between home and school. Opportunities in this area will not be limited to local workshops but may include attendance to state, regional, and national parent conferences and other appropriate avenues of learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">To the extent feasible and appropriate, the DeKalb County School District Title I program collaboratively coordinates and integrates parent involvement with the state funded preK program, kindergarten, prevention intervention, exceptional education, professional development, parent advisory council, and technical resources. Additionally, to the extent feasible, appropriate roles for community-based organizations and businesses in parent involvement are collaboratively developed with the Partners in Education department, to include, but not limited to, the provision of opportunities for organizations and businesses to work with parents and schools and encouraging the formation of partnerships between elementary schools, middle schools, secondary schools, and local businesses that include a role for parents and other opportunities such as life skills training, family crisis intervention, and community education opportunities. The DeKalb County School District, to the extent appropriate and feasible, maintains systemwide opportunities for parents to learn about child development and child rearing beginning at birth that are designed to help parents to become full partners in the education of their children. The opportunities include, but are not limited to, parent resource centers [ http://www.dekalb.k12.ga.us/parent-resource-centers ] , Systematic Training for Effective Parenting program, Parents Assuring Student Success (PassPort), parent cluster meetings, and instructional fairs. Local schools are encouraged to implement activities that are appropriate, needed, and/or of interest to their participating parents. Because of the number of international families within the school system and their increasing participation in Title I activities, the DeKalb County School District Title I program ensures to the extent possible to provide information related to schools, parent programs, and meeting and other activities of participating children in the language used in the home. Full opportunities for the participation of international parents who have limited English proficiency and parents with disabilities are ensured including but not limited to providing information and school profiles in a language, and form such parents understand to the extent feasible and appropriate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">The development of training activities of teachers, principals, and other educators may involve Title I parents when feasible to improve the instruction and services to Title I students. DeKalb County School District Title I may provide literacy training for parents if all other reasonably available funding sources for literacy activities have been exhausted. DeKalb County School District Title I office or schools may pay reasonable and necessary expenses that parents incur by participating in school-related meetings and training sessions where appropriate and allowable, such as transportation and childcare. DeKalb County School District Title I, where appropriate and feasible, train and support parents to enhance the involvement of other parents. Meetings involving parents will be arranged at a variety of times, such as morning and evenings, to maximize opportunities for parents to participate in school related activities. Teachers and other educators who work directly with participating children may arrange in-home conferences, where appropriate and feasible, with parents who are unable to attend conferences scheduled at school. The DeKalb County School District, where appropriate and feasible, may adopt and implement model approaches to improving parental involvement activities, such as Even Start and Parents as Teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="202">The DeKalb County School District will provide other reasonable, appropriate, and feasible support for parental involvement activities, if parents request it. The Parent Involvement policy of the DeKalb County School District and each participating school is evaluated annually as to the effectiveness in increasing parent participation and identifying barriers to parent participation such as low income, disabilities, limited literacy, language, or other cultural or ethnic considerations. The findings of the annual evaluation are used to design strategies for school improvement or to redesign the parent policies. All non-satisfactory parent comments regarding parent involvement and system plan are collected and attached to the plan when submitted to the state Title I office. In particular, eligibility for Title I funding, available to school districts in high poverty areas, is now contingent upon the development of "compacts" in which families and schools agree to assume mutual responsibility for children's learning: partnerships must be forged between homes, schools, and communities, requiring an unprecedented level of contact and communication between parents and educators (e.g., U.S. Department of Education, 1994). While most practitioners and researchers support the policy direction of increased parent involvement, few agree about what constitutes effective involvement. Confusion persists regarding the activities, goals, and desired outcomes of various parent involvement programs and policies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">A major source of this confusion is the lack of scientific rigor in the research informing practice and policy. Because of this, less is known about parent involvement than commonly is assumed. Nonetheless, early studies suggesting the importance of parent involvement are treated as definitive, regardless of the equivocal nature of the data, and they are used to support the position that all types of parent involvement are important. Moreover, many programs and policies promoting parent involvement are not explicitly based on the evidence that does exist. Reliance on such compromised data may lead to unrealistic expectations of what parent involvement programs and practices actually are able to accomplish. Fortunately, the current national policy agenda has created a window of opportunity for improving programs and practice through high quality research. Thus, this digest, which is based on a critical evaluation of over 200 research studies, briefly reviews findings from parent involvement research to date, discusses their validity and utility, and proposes critical questions for future researchers in the field to consider.</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">Years of practice wisdom, theory, and related areas of research (i.e., the importance of the home literacy environment, parental stimulation of children's language development, security of the parent-child attachment relationship, and parent involvement in preschool and early intervention programs) strongly suggest that parents' involvement in their children's formal schooling is vital for their academic success, even though the research evidence is less than conclusive. While methodological limitations are prevalent in the majority of parent involvement research (described below), the sound studies that do exist have consistently found strong parent involvement effects. For example, Tizard, Schofield, and Hewison (1982) demonstrated the clear positive impact of parents' listening to their children read at home; Fantuzzo, Davis, and Ginsburg (1995) demonstrated that an intervention program that included a parent involvement component was clearly superior to another without one; and Rodick and Henggeler (1980) found that a parent involvement intervention was more advantageous for children than an in-school intervention. Moreover, the cumulative knowledge from existing studies suggests the importance of several other specific types of parent involvement, including the following: provision of a stimulating literacy and material environment (Snow et al., 1991), high expectations and moderate levels of parental suport and supervision (Kurdek, Fine, &amp; Sinclair, 1995), appropriate monitoring of television viewing and homework completion (Clark, 1993), participation in joint learning activities at home (Tizard et al., 1982), an emphasis on effort over ability (Stevenson, 1983), and autonomy promoting parenting practices (Lamborn, Mounts, Steinberg, &amp; Dornbusch, 1991). There is mounting evidence that each of these parent involvement variables facilitates children's academic achievement. There are also indications that they do so in relatively complex ways that interact with family background and social context variables such as ethnicity, family structure, maternal employment status, socioeconomic status, and gender (Schiamberg &amp; Chin, 1986; Milne, 1989; Tocci &amp; Englehard, 1991; Zimilies &amp; Lee, 1991; Lee &amp; Croninger, 1994).</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">Continuing to determine the ways that various types of parent involvement positively affect student achievement in different contexts should be a major research priority in the field. Further, to have greater confidence in the findings of such studies, higher quality research must be conducted. Methodological Limitations in Existing Research Despite the validity of some studies, much parent involvement research to date contains serious methodological flaws, which results in a lack of confidence in their findings and limits their accuracy and usefulness. In general, flaws in existing research fall into four areas: use of non experimental design, lack of isolation of parent involvement effects, inconsistent definitions of parent involvement, and non-objective measures of parent involvement. Use of Non-Experimental Design Many of the field studies examining the impact of parent involvement on children's achievement employ non-experimental designs which are too weak to allow for confidence in their findings. These designs-as compared to true experiments-do not contain the controls necessary for researchers to conclude that parent involvement is the cause of enhanced student performance. Thus, alternative explanations, other than parent involvement, cannot be ruled out.</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">For example, one common alternative explanation rarely ruled out in such non-experimental designs is that the children in the parent involvement program were better students to begin with than were those not in the program. In such cases, these children would have performed better academically regardless of the parent involvement intervention. Only with a true experiment can it be ascertained with certainty that improved student achievement is due to parent involvement. Lack of Isolation of Parent Involvement Effects Separation of the effects of parent involvement from that of the involvement of other adults. Many studies did not isolate the effect of parent involvement from the benefits of extra assistance in learning. For example, in many studies, children in a parent involvement intervention were compared with children not receiving the intervention, and improvements in achievement were identified as benefits of parent involvement. Drawing such a conclusion is based on the consensus in the field that parent involvement programs have their impact not only through specific learning activities, but through changes in a network of interrelated family factors (i.e., home environment, parental expectations for their children's performance, increased cognitive stimulation) (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">The studies did not rule out an alternative explanation: that children's performance would improve after they received extra assistance from any adult. Researchers sometimes concluded that parent involvement was the critical factor in the success of an intervention program that offered a variety of concurrent activities, such as an educational curriculum for children or social services for the family. However, they failed to test the specific effects of parent involvement in analyses independent of the effects of other aspects of the program. Conclusions regarding the specific impact of parent involvement are not justified in such studies. In fact, some studies have been able to isolate the specific effects of parent involvement. This suggests that certain research designs where a single parent involvement component is measured and related to a single child achievement outcome offer a feasible approach for examining the relationship among these individual variables. Inconsistent Definitions of Parent Involvement While many studies have measured the construct of parent involvement, few have operationalized it the same way.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">Other researchers have focused on behavioral aspects of parent involvement, such as assistance with homework or attendance at parent-teacher conferences. Such differences in definitions and measurement of parent involvement make it difficult to assess cumulative knowledge across different studies. Even when focusing on the same aspect of parent involvement, researchers operationalized it inconsistently. For example, while several studies have examined the impact of the quality of the home environment on children's academic achievement, rarely did two studies define home environment in the same way. While there is clearly a conceptual overlap between these two operationalizations of the home environment, they are nevertheless quite distinct: the former emphasizes the processes within the parent-child affective relationship that may impact student achievement while the latter emphasizes the family material and psychological resources allocated to children. Equally problematic is the measurement of only a specific aspect of parent involvement (attitudes, behaviors, etc.) while discussing results in terms of the broader construct without acknowledging that only a portion of it was actually measured. Because parents, students, and teachers have a vested interest in reporting parents' behavior in a certain light, there may be distortions in the data collected.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">Some researchers have attempted to increase the validity of self-report data by measuring parent involvement from more than one source (parent, teachers, students). Self report measures of parent involvement have another drawback in that they tend to be closed-ended surveys that cannot fully capture the dynamic nature of parents' involvement in their children's education. When parents visit schools, meet with teachers, read to their school-aged children, and assist their children with homework, complex interactions are at work. Many of these processes could better be explored through open-ended and observational techniques, which would produce rich data, shed light on multi-faceted interactions and relationships over time, and generate new hypotheses about the role of parent involvement. Unfortunately, they tend to be among the weaker parent involvement studies, plagued by many of the flaws described above. Recommendations for Future Research Future parent involvement studies must overcome the methodological limitations identified above in order to increase their accuracy and utility. While increasing the rigor of parent involvement research in educational settings, researchers will also have to be more sensitive to the needs of parents and staff who may consider implementation of some of the more rigorous evaluation procedures intrusive and judgmental.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">In addition, funding allocations to program evaluations and applied educational research in general will need to increase. The resulting data will be more useful, justifying the cost, and it is possible that more effective parent involvement will generate cost savings by lessening the need for remedial and other special programs. In addition, researchers designing parent involvement studies need to take care that their presumptions are well-defined, their questions are clear, and their findings are unambiguous. To accomplish these goals, studies should embody the following characteristics: Use of Experimental Procedures Only one study design, the true experiment, adequately overcomes all the threats to internal validity problematic in educational research. The critical component of this design, random assignment to the control and experimental groups, rules out pre-test differences between groups, so that differences at post-test can be attributed to the independent variable-parent involvement, in this case-with confidence. In order to conduct this type of study, a new level of partnership will need to be forged between practitioners and researchers to enable the use of experimental procedures in service settings, and program staff concerns related to random assignment and potentially intrusive data collection procedures will need to be addressed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">Isolation of the Effects of Parent Involvement In order to truly understand and document the full impact of parent involvement, studies must separate parent involvement effects from related variables and from the impact of other adults involved in the program by: (1) specifically measuring a parent's involvement (i.e., type and level) separate from other components of the intervention in order to assess its independent impact on the identified outcomes, and (2) evaluating the differential influences of the content of a program and the deliverer (parent or other adult) of the program on outcomes. Clarification of the Definition of Parent Involvement Researchers must make explicit which aspect of involvement is being measured and how it fits into the broader construct of parent involvement in order to create a coherent understanding of the importance of different aspects of involvement. To ease researchers' ability to compare their findings with the work of others, and to build upon existing knowledge in a systematic fashion, researchers will need to develop and validate common instruments for measuring parent involvement across a variety of settings. Drawing on Epstein's (1994) six-item classification system-covering school-home communications, parent involvement in school and community, home learning activities, and parents as decision-makers-might prove useful for developing such a measurement, as it provides a widely accepted typology of parent involvement. Objective Measurement of Parent Involvement Studies must use techniques such as direct observation of parental behavior with standardized data collection tools, since self-report data can be unreliable. Additional Study Design Improvements The following issues also require further attention in parent involvement research: Location of Parent Involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">Research is needed to identify the unique and overlapping benefits of involvement at school and involvement in the home. It is clear from the existing knowledge base that involvement in these different ecological settings is not interchangeable, especially with respect to the barriers and goals of involvement. This is especially true for involvement at school, which may interact with other parental activities to increase parental stress and/or lead to overload. Thus, studies should attempt to determine the optimal amount of parent involvement. Further, it has not yet been determined whether quantity is the appropriate scale for assessing involvement. Quality of involvement (between parent and teachers and between parents and their children) may be a more important dimension for assessing the impact of parent involvement. For example, if parents grudgingly read to their children, the effect may be more deleterious than their declining to do so.</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">Comprehensiveness of Parent Involvement. More research is needed to determine whether parents need to be involved in all aspects of a parent involvement program (planning, implementation, evaluation) in order for their involvement to be valid and beneficial. Currently, some practitioners attempt to engage parents in all levels of school functioning or at all levels of implementation of a parent program within the school in the belief that the more comprehensive the involvement of parents, the greater the benefit to children's education. It may be that discrete and targeted types of involvement can also produce a positive impact. Complexity of Involvement Patterns. For example: (1) relationships among different types of parent involvement; (2) the relative importance of different aspects of parent involvement at different points in the life of the student; and (3) the complex processes by which different types of involvement interact to mediate, moderate, or suppress each other. Ancillary Beneficiaries of Parent Involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">Much remains to be learned about the impact of discrete parent involvement activities and particular beneficiaries, such as the parents themselves, families, schools, and communities. For example, the impact of involvement in their children's education on parents' literacy, self-esteem, and feelings about their children has yet to be explored and documented. Similar detailed questions remain to be explored about the effects on the community of an active parent involvement program within the district public schools. Differential Gender Effects of Parent Involvement. It is important for research studies to consider from the outset the relationships between parent involvement and student achievement separated by gender. Indeed, the research studies that have done so suggest that the specific aspects of parent involvement considered-parental styles and parenting techniques-have different effects depending upon the gender of the child. For example, Lobel and Bempechat (1992) found that mothers with a high need for social approval had sons with high performance expectations, although their daughters were not similarly affected.</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">Conversely, Phillips (1992) found that parents' goals for their children's educational achievement was a stronger predictor of achievement gains for girls than for boys, and that parents of girls had higher expectations for their children's educational achievement than parents of boys. In order to study gender differentials, research will need to generate hypotheses about which types of parent involvement are likely to have different outcomes for boys and girls. Despite the validity of some studies, much parent involvement research to date contains serious methodological flaws. The bias in using subjective reports in parent involvement research should be a serious concern. Lack of objective data becomes especially problematic when information about parent involvement and child achievement outcomes is reported by the same person; the result can be a distortion of the statistical relationships obtained, producing stronger correlations between the two than would otherwise be the case. In addition to the general constraints of conducting research in an applied setting, program evaluations pose special obstacles for researchers because of the clinical and ethical issues involved in withholding treatment or wait-listing participants who clearly might benefit from the program (i.e., at-risk students, low-income families). Specifically, greater attention needs to be paid to several key issues in parent involvement research, related to both theory and methodology, in order for studies to identify with greater precision the types of involvement that have positive outcomes for students' achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">Researchers need to take into account the complex and transactional nature of interrelationships between parent involvement and its outcomes.

This digest is based on an in-depth review of research studies, Parent Involvement in Children's Education: A critical Assessment of the Knowledge Base, by Amy J.L. Baker and Laura M. Soden, prepared for the National Council of Jewish Women Center for the Child, New York, NY. As Carol Ascher (1986) has stated, "Of all education issues, parent involvement is one of the vaguest and most shifting in its meanings. Parent involvement may easily mean quite different things to different people" (p. 109). Adding to this distinction, Ascher (1988) finds that "the meaning of parent involvement in this new era [the 1980's] has shifted from the affairs of the school to the home site" (p. 120).</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">Because of the difficulties in operationally defining "parent involvement," many theorists have concentrated their efforts more on specific categorization of the different types of parent involvement. Further breakdowns in the broader parent involvement models are proposed by Gordon (1977) and Bauch et al. (1973). Gordon's six types of parent involvement (Gordon &amp; Breivogel, 1976) are: (a) the traditional type of parent involvement type (the parent as audience or bystander-observer); (b) parents as decision makers (as in School Advisory Committees or Parent Teacher Associations [PTAs] in which parents participate in school decision making activities); (c) parents begin as classroom volunteers; (d) parent as a paid paraprofessional or teacher's aide; (e) parents as learners (e.g., participate in child development or parenting classes); and (f) parents as teachers of their own children at home. These research findings provide seven types of parent-involvement: (a) parent as communicator, (b) parent as supporter of activities, (c) parent as learner, (d) parent as advocate, (e) parent as decision maker, (f) parent as volunteer/professional, and (g) parent as home activities teacher. State Mandated Parent Involvement Programs There have been a number of attempts to mandate parent involvement programs at the local, state, and national levels. For example, on a local level, in 1973, a Florida law mandated that all school districts must form school advisory committees (SACs) either at the local school or the school district level that represent the community of the school, have students and parents as members, and be obligated to participate in the preparation of the Annual Report of School Progress that is sent to the parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="220">Florida SACs have participated in making decisions regarding such problem areas as the school budget, curriculum issues, desegregation, textbook selection, and faculty evaluation and selection. On a state level, Missouri's State Department of Education has developed several programs in increase parent involvement. The first is the Parents as Teachers program that helps train parents so that they can teach their own children at home in skills learned at home. A second program, Success is Homemade, expands the parent involvement from kindergarten though the end of high school (Epstein, 1991). At the federal level, the Office of Educational Research and Improvement is developing a Center on Families, Communities, Schools, and Children's Learning. According to Epstein (1991) this center will research the relationship between school, home, and community from birth to adolescence. California has mandated parent involvement as have Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, Minnesota, and Florida.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">According to Solomon (1991), California has mandated that These programs should be designed to: (a) help parents develop skills and foster conditions at home that support learning, (b) provide parents with the knowledge of techniques designed to assist children in learning at home, (c) provide access to and coordinate community and support services for children and families, (d) promote clear two-way communication between the school and the family to the school programs and children's progress, (e) involve parents, after appropriated training, in instructional and support roles at school, and (f) support parents as decision makers and develop their leadership in governance, advisory, and advocacy roles (p. 361). Implications for the Collaboration Between Schools and Parents Overall, the studies outlined in this article showed parent involvement to have a positive effect on the achievement of students. Home-based types of parent involvement were found to have a significant and positive relationship with achievement (Hickman, Greenwood, &amp; Miller, 1995). The Coleman report (Coleman et al., 1966), as well as Mosteller and Moynihan (1972), and Coleman (1975) also reported that home-based variables were at least as important as the school-based variables in accounting for the total amount of student achievement variance. Home-based type findings agree with the contentions of Bauch (1988).</paragraph><paragraph parID="222">Examples of this type of direct involvement could include having the parents monitor the homework of their children or help with editing school reports. "These are all activities that appear to have a direct impact on student attitudes, behavior, and leaning" (p.81-82). The high schools of the future should work to incorporate these parents into the daily plan (or at least the weekly plan). Home-Based Involvement Schools and teachers should develop specific procedures for encouraging and implementing home-based parent involvement. This can be done in a number of ways. One of these is to use regular home-visits by either the teacher or a trained paraprofessional.</paragraph><paragraph parID="223">This might include information about the school events, learning opportunities, and suggestions for helping the students. Increasing the role of parent as supporter might be accomplished by simply giving parents more information, for example, letting parents know that their attendance at school events can increase school achievement as Dornbusch and Ritter (1988) have demonstrated. Contacting the parents of the average students, as well as the low-achieving and high-achieving students makes all parents feel more confident in contacting the teachers and discussing these conversations with their children. Regular home visits can also be effective in opening the lines of communication between parents and schools. In addition, having a room specifically designed for the parents may encourage visits. This room can have reading materials appropriate to the age group of the students, information about upcoming activities, and other announcements of interest to the parents. Flaxman and Inger (1991) point out that parent involvement at all grade levels is important.</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">"The benefits of parent involvement are not confined to early childhood or the elementary grades. There are strong positive effects from involving parents continuously through high school" (p. 5), not only for enhancing the educational success of high school parents, but also because of a number of social changes which are occurring. Research on parent involvement has indicated that the activities within the context of the home will play a significant role in the academic achievement and satisfaction of students. In order to use this information to create the high schools of the future, several recommendations are made. Parents need to be educated as to the importance of their role in education. Many parents need to be disabused of the idea that the school is the domain of the teachers and that school is the place for education. Learning is an experience which happens both at school and at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">The training of teachers in general and specific techniques to invite parents in their children's education is necessary. This needs to be accomplished at both the pre-service level as well as during in-service training sessions. The development of parent involvement programs will need to be funded by the educational community. As society changes, the needs of our students will change and the educational system needs to not only keep up with these changes, but to be on the cutting edge. In order to prepare students for their future. The role of the administration is vital in terms of the support of teacher and parent collaboration. Graduate programs in educational administration need to include information concerning the relevance of parent involvement programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">The Future of High School Success: The Importance of Parent Involvement Programs Many studies have shown a strong correlation between parent involvement and a child's success in school (Ascher, 1988; Hickman, Greenwood, &amp; Miller, 1995; Rhine, 1981). The authors of the Coleman Report (Coleman et al., 1966) indicated that about one-half to two-thirds of the variance in student achievement could be accounted for by home variables rather than school variables. Similar evidence was found by Mosteller and Moynihan (1972) in their reanalysis of the Coleman data. Following up on this (and other research) this article will focus on the role that parent involvement programs will play in the high school of the future and how parent involvement programs can help to meet the changing needs of high school students and their families.

Many of the field studies examining the impact of parent involvement on children's achievement employ non-experimental designs which are too weak to allow for confidence in their findings. These designs--as compared to true experiments--do not contain the controls necessary for researchers to conclude that parent involvement is the cause of enhanced student performance. LACK OF ISOLATION OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT EFFECTS SEPARATION OF THE EFFECTS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT FROM THAT OF THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER ADULTS. SEPARATION OF THE EFFECTS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT FROM THAT OF OTHER INTERVENTION COMPONENTS. INCONSISTENT DEFINITIONS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT While many studies have measured the construct of parent involvement, few have operationalized it the same way.</paragraph><paragraph parID="230">Some researchers have focused on attitudinal components of parent involvement by defining it as parental aspirations or expectations for the child's educational success. In other cases parent involvement was conceptualized as parenting style or family interaction patterns. In one, the home environment was measured as maternal involvement and responsiveness, avoidance of restriction, organized environment, play facilitation, and daily variety. Alternatively, another study defined the home environment as the number of parents in the home, the home library, reading at home, watching television, working on homework, absence from school, parent involvement, and family resources. Researchers frequently assessed parent involvement by the parent's (or some other informant's) report rather than by observation or objective measure. Thus, more is known about what parent say they do than about what they actually do. However, this approach has resulted in low correspondence among the different respondents, indicating that one or both reports may have been inaccurate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="231">INACCURACY OF PROGRAM EVALUATIONS Program evaluations may be the most challenging form of applied educational field research that exists. Including parents in the development of measures and protocols may ease their concerns and also provide a mechanism for obtaining valuable input. USE OF EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Only one study design, the true experiment, adequately overcomes all the threats to internal validity problematic in educational research. The critical component of this design, random assignment to the control and experimental groups, rules out pre-test differences between groups, so that differences at post-test can be attributed to the independent variable--parent involvement, in this case--with confidence. ISOLATION OF THE EFFECTS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">In order to truly understand and document the full impact of parent involvement, studies must separate parent involvement effects from related variables and from the impact of other adults involved in the program by: (1) specifically measuring a parent's involvement (i.e., type and level) separate from other components of the intervention in order to assess its independent impact on the identified outcomes, and (2) evaluating the differential influences of the content of a program and the deliverer (parent or other adult) of the program on outcomes. CLARIFICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT Researchers must make explicit which aspect of involvement is being measured and how it fits into the broader construct of parent involvement in order to create a coherent understanding of the importance of different aspects of involvement. Drawing on Epstein's (1994) six-item classification system--covering school-home communications, parent involvement in school and community, home learning activities, and parents as decision-makers--might prove useful for developing such a measurement, as it provides a widely accepted typology of parent involvement. Studies must use techniques such as direct observation of parental behavior with standardized data collection tools, since self-report data can be unreliable. ADDITIONAL STUDY DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS The following issues also require further attention in parent involvement research:</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">LOCATION OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT. AMOUNT OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT. The amount of involvement necessary to effect a positive impact on children needs to be identified. Questions regarding threshold effects of involvement (the minimum amount of involvement necessary to have an effect) and overload/ceiling effects (the saturation point of involvement) have yet to be adequately addressed. COMPREHENSIVENESS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT. ANCILLARY BENEFICIARIES OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT. DIFFERENTIAL GENDER EFFECTS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT.</paragraph><paragraph parID="234">Indeed, the research studies that have done so suggest that the specific aspects of parent involvement considered--parental styles and parenting techniques--have different effects depending upon the gender of the child.

Epstein's Six Types of Parent Involvement Joyce Epstein of Johns Hopkins University has developed a framework for defining six different types of parent involvement. "There are many reasons for developing school, family, and community partnerships," she writes. "The main reason to create such partnerships is to help all youngsters succeed in school and in later life."</paragraph><paragraph parID="240">Epstein's framework defines the six types of involvement and lists sample practices or activities to describe the involvement more fully. Her work also describes the challenges inherent in fostering each type of parent involvement as well as the expected results of implementing them for students, parents, and teachers. The following information is excerpted from Epstein's work. Epstein's Framework of Six Types of Involvement and Sample Practices PARENTING: Help all families establish home environments to support children as students Parent education and other courses or training for parents (e.g., GED, college credit, family literacy). Family support programs to assist families with health, nutrition, and other services.</paragraph><paragraph parID="241">Home visits at transition points to pre-school, elementary, middle, and high school. COMMUNICATING: Design effective forms of school-to-home and home-to-school communications about school programs and children's progress. Conferences with every parent at least once a year. Language translators to assist families as needed. Regular schedule of useful notices, memos, phone calls, newsletters, and other communications. VOLUNTEERING: Recruit and organize parent help and support. School and classroom volunteer program to help teachers, administrators, students, and other parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="242">Parent room or family center for volunteer work, meetings, resources for families. Annual postcard survey to identify all available talents, times, and locations of volunteers. LEARNING AT HOME: Provide information and ideas to families about how to help students at home with homework and other curriculum-related activities, decisions, and planning. Information for families on skills required for students in all subjects at each grade. Information on homework policies and how to monitor and discuss schoolwork at home. Independent advocacy groups to lobby and work for school reform and improvements. Networks to link all families with parent representatives.</paragraph><paragraph parID="243">COLLABORATING WITH COMMUNITY: Identify and integrate resources and services from the community to strengthen school programs, family practices, and student learning and development. Information for students and families on community health, cultural, recreational, social support, and other programs or services. Information on community activities that link to learning skills and talents, including summer programs for students. Service to the community by students, families, and schools (e.g. recycling, art, music, drama, and other activities for seniors or others). What Can You Do To Get Involved How Can I Be Involved In My Child's Education? Research studies consistently reveal that high student achievement and self-esteem are closely related to positive parental participation in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="244">Almost everyone agrees that parents are, after all, their children's first and most important teachers. You may also have ideas for improving your child's school. But even though studies show that most parents want to be involved in their children's education, they may not be exactly sure how to go about it, especially if, like most parents, they work during the school day. Parents often ask the following questions: What Can I Do To Involve Myself With My Child's School? Some schools value parent involvement by providing numerous opportunities for parents to interact with each other, with teachers, and with students. Your child's school can provide ideas on how to participate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="245">Many schools are moving toward "school-based management," in which administrators share the responsibility for operating schools with teachers, students, parents, and community members. This communication should also include non- custodial parents, stepparents, and any other adults, such as grandparents, who are responsible for the child. If you aren't receiving such information, ask for it. Some schools send newsletters and calendars home regularly, alerting parents to school functions and ways they can participate. Encourage your school to provide volunteer opportunities for working parents and to schedule some school events outside of the school day to increase participation. Here are other ideas: Visit your child's classroom; a visit will give you an idea of what your child does at school and how he or she interacts with other children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="246">Volunteer to help in the classroom as an assistant (listening to children read, for example, or serving as an aide during computer work). Support student events and performances by helping with them (such as sewing costumes or painting scenery for a school play) and by attending them. If your school has a Parents' Room/Lounge or Parent Center, drop in to meet other parents and teachers there, or to pick up information and materials. Participate in workshops that are offered, such as those on child development or concerns that parents have (or help plan such workshops). Take advantage of parent-teacher contracts (perhaps agreeing to read with your child for a certain amount of time each night). Ask your child's teacher if he or she has materials that you can use to help your child at home and to supplement homework. Be part of decision-making committees about school issues and problems, such as a Parent Advisory Committee.</paragraph><paragraph parID="247">How Can I Help My Child With Homework? Reward progress; use lots of praise; display good work. Find out how much and what type of homework is assigned in each class, how students are expected to prepare it and turn it in, and what students can do when they don't understand something; help your child manage the workload by dividing it into small doses. Help your child develop a homework schedule that he or she can stick to. Provide a suitable place for study (if possible, make it quiet and away from the distractions of TV, phone, and loud music). Avoid making homework a punishment. How Can I Make Our Home a Good Place for My Child To Learn?</paragraph><paragraph parID="248">Establish rules and routines in the home. Monitor television viewing. Limit after-school jobs and activities. If you don't do anything else, read to your young child or have him or her read to you every night. Encourage older children to read by reading yourself and by having interesting and appropriate materials available. What Should I Do If My Child Isn't Doing Well in School? Don't wait for the school to contact you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="249">It's important to resolve problems as soon as possible when they occur. When parents work with teachers, they are often able to improve a child's performance in school. Children also get the sense that education is really important when they see their parents involved with their teachers and their school. Parents feel a sense of accomplishment, too, when they help their children succeed in school. Ask your child's teacher for specific activities you can do at home with your child and help the teacher better understand what works best with your child. Make it clear that if the teacher sees a problem developing, you want to hear about it immediately. Then, meet with your child's teacher frequently until the problem is resolved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="250">The problem may not lie with school itself, but with peers or friends. So don't underestimate what YOU, as a parent, can contribute to your child's learning experiences, no matter how much education you yourself have.

One important way you can become involved in your child's schooling is to exercise any choices available in the selection of course work, programs, or even schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="251">You can become involved in committees that govern your child's school or join the local parent-teacher association. The National Coalition for Parent Involvement in Education (NCPIE) says that schools should regularly communicate with parents about their child's progress and the educational objectives of the school. Work with other parents and guardians to be sure that the school understands how best to keep you informed. Have high expectations for your child's learning and behavior, both at home and at school. Children whose parents are involved in their education have better grades, a more positive attitude toward school, and more appropriate school behavior than those with less involved parents. The Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC) operates 16 clearinghouses specializing in education topics. The nature of parent choice, too, can have a potential impact on school performance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="252">If parents engage in an extensive search among many schools, and emphasize criteria clearly related to school and student performance, one would expect schools to feel more pressure to perform. On the other hand, if parents choose after considering only one school, or choose on the basis of non-academic criteria such as proximity to home or the school&#65533;s racial mix, schools might feel less compelled to produce results. The second estimate, then, is of the percentage of choice parents who consider more than one school in making their choice: Estimate of MPS choice parents choosing from among two or more schools: 44.4% That is, about 45 percent of parents who actively choose a school for their child are estimated to do so after considering at least two schools. Among these &#65533;two-choice parents,&#65533; the following estimate represents the percentage who explicitly seek information on school performance, such as test scores, dropout rates, and so on: Estimate of MPS two-choice parents considering academic factors when choosing: 64.8%</paragraph><paragraph parID="253">Taken together, these three estimates allow one to do some calculations regarding a hypothetical &#65533;ideal consumer&#65533; in a public school choice system. This is the consumer who would maximize the marketplace pressures on schools, thereby creating the greatest prospects for school reform and student achievement. Such a consumer would: exercise choice, rather than simply enrolling his or her child in the local neighborhood school; consider at least two schools in the choice process, rather than simply choosing a school without assessing the potential costs and benefits of alternatives; and bring performance-based/academic criteria to bear in the choice process. Based on the figures above, the estimate of MPS parents meeting all three criteria is roughly 10 percent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="254">[iii] Lynn Bosetti, &#65533;Determinants of school choice: understanding how parents choose elementary schools in Alberta,&#65533; Journal of Education Policy , Vol.19, No.4, July 2004, pp.387, 8. [iv] A number of literature reviews attest to these effects. The district itself has embraced two reforms in particular: public school choice and parental involvement. Advocates of public school choice claim that by permitting parents to choose among a variety of public school options within the district, competition for students will ensue. This should improve school effectiveness and efficiency, and ultimately lead to better student outcomes. Thus, the parental involvement movement seeks to engage parents as partners in learning activities, both on-site and at home. Research has shown that such engagement can produce higher levels of student performance, other things being equal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="255">Research has also shown, however, that both reforms can be stifled in districts like MPS, with relatively large percentages of poor, minority, single-parent families, and families of otherwise low socioeconomic status. With regard to public school choice, many of these families: may fail to exercise choice altogether; or may exercise choice, but do so with inadequate or inaccurate information; and/or may choose schools largely on the basis of non-academic criteria. As for parental involvement, disadvantaged parents may withdraw from participation in their child&#65533;s education because of lack of time, energy, understanding, or confidence. This study offers estimates of the extent and nature of public school choice and parental involvement within the MPS district.</paragraph><paragraph parID="256">The basic approach is to identify the frequency and determinants of parental choice and parental involvement using a national data set, and extrapolate those results to Milwaukee, relying on the particular demographics of the MPS district. This approach leads to the following estimates of parental choice behavior within MPS: estimate of MPS two-choice parents considering academic factors when choosing: 64.8 percent The estimate of MPS parents meeting all three criteria is just 10 percent. Given this number, it seems unlikely that MPS schools are feeling the pressure of a genuine educational marketplace. Considering on-site involvement first, an estimated 34 percent of MPS parents can be considered &#65533;highly involved&#65533; at their child&#65533;s school. (Given the comparatively limited impact of on-site involvement on student achievement, only high levels of parental involvement are worth considering.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="257">Estimates of at-home parental involvement were derived separately for three different groups of students. Those groups are listed below, along with the estimates of the percentage of parents in each group that are moderately or highly involved in their child&#65533;s educational experience at home: students nine years old or younger: 49.2 percent moderately or highly involved , students ranging in age from 10 to 13: 42.5 percent moderately or highly involved , and students from 14 to 17 years old: 39.7 percent moderately or highly involved . The numbers above can be combined to estimate the percentage of MPS parents who are highly involved at the school site and moderately to highly involved in their children&#65533;s learning at home. The children of these parents would expect to enjoy the most significant boost from parental involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="258">The estimates for each age group are as follows: Students from ages 10 through 13: 17.7 percent Students from ages 14 through 17: 11.2 percent Taken as a whole, these numbers indicate significant limits on the capacity of public school choice and parental involvement to improve school quality and student performance within MPS. Parents simply do not appear sufficiently engaged in available choice opportunities or their children&#65533;s educational activities to ensure the desired outcomes. This may be just as well. Relying on public school choice and parental involvement to reclaim MPS may be a distraction from the hard work of fixing the district&#65533;s schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="259">Recognizing this, the question is whether the district, its schools, and its supporters in Madison are prepared to embrace more radical reforms. Given the high stakes involved, district parents should insist on nothing less. The Milwaukee Public School (MPS) district, like many of its big-city counterparts in other states, continues to suffer from poor student performance. Figure 1 presents reading, math, and science proficiency levels for MPS students and students in the rest of the state, respectively, at the fourth, eighth, and tenth grade levels. At the fourth grade level, only about half of MPS students achieved a level of &#65533;proficient&#65533; or &#65533;advanced&#65533; on the mathematics and science portions of the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concept Examination (WKCE) or the Wisconsin Alternate Assessments (WAA). Their counterparts in the rest of the state had combined proficient and advanced levels of about 80 percent. Students in other parts of the state also did better, however, scoring in the low 80s.</paragraph><paragraph parID="260">MPS student performance, though, drops considerably. This trend continues through the tenth grade. By that point, just 40 percent of MPS students are at the proficient or advanced level in reading; 30 percent in mathematics; and 27 percent in science. Given the poor performance of MPS tenth graders, one would not be surprised to find that many of them do not make it to graduation. The most recent data available confirm these suspicions. Only 68 percent of MPS high school students avoided dropping out and successfully earned their diploma. The comparable figure for the rest of the state was 91 percent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="261">TWO THEORIES OF EDUCATION REFORM This paper will discuss the theory and practice of two important reforms in particular: public school choice and parental involvement. PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE Public school choice&#65533; refers to a variety of measures designed to put parents in the role of educational consumers, shopping for the best product for their child from among a variety of public schooling options. intra-district choice&#65533;a system allowing parents to choose among multiple schools in their home district; magnet schools&#65533;public schools offering specialized courses or curricula, and often drawing on students from across multiple districts; and As an educational reform, public school choice follows a market model.</paragraph><paragraph parID="262">Advocates argue that if parents are limited to an assigned school in their home district, schools have no incentive to perform, to improve, and to build educational programs to meet the unique needs of their students and community. Schools are, in effect, granted a monopoly, and behave like monopoly operators who do not have to work to keep their customers. a system of school choice will create competition among schools for student enrollment, resulting in schools being more responsive to the needs and interests of parents and students by providing different types of programmes for different types of families. Though &#65533;school choice&#65533; is often used as short-hand for &#65533;vouchers&#65533;&#65533;that is, programs that provide public funding for students to attend private schools&#65533;the logic of the educational marketplace applies just as well (in theory) to choice among public schools. Once the choice is made, parents must then become actively engaged in the child&#65533;s education, both at home and at school. attending parent-teacher conferences; serving on a district governing board;</paragraph><paragraph parID="263">participating in a parent-teacher association or school council; volunteering at school events or in the classroom; designating a specific time and space for study at home; helping the child with homework, or checking to make sure that homework has been completed; discussing school issues with the child; and reading to, or with, the child. Other things being equal, parents who are actively engaged in the support of their children&#65533;s education through such activities are likely to see them earn higher grades, score better on standardized tests, attend school more regularly, and progress further in their education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="264">There is some disagreement in the literature as to which forms of parental involvement produce the most meaningful results. [v] Similarly, the mechanism(s) whereby parental involvement produces beneficial results are not entirely settled in the literature, though the likely avenues are fairly intuitive. By interacting with children in the educational process at home, parents impart skills to their children, communicate to them the value of education, help cultivate their interest in learning, and create an expectation of attention to schoolwork. Thus, children with involved parents have a head start in terms of basic skills, motivation to learn, and the value they ascribe to education. When parents follow up their at-home involvement with involvement at school, they reinforce for the child their commitment to and belief in the importance of his or her education. They also serve as a conduit for important information from home to school and school to home, which can also improve learning outcomes. As with all theories of educational reform, the primary appeal of these two theories&#65533;public school choice, and parental involvement&#65533;is the promise of improved student performance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="265">Beyond this, though, they have a less advertised, and less obvious, political appeal to supporters of traditional public education. First, public school choice presents a clear alternative to the favorite education reform of political conservatives&#65533;private school choice. If extending market principles to education works in the context of private choice initiatives such as Milwaukee&#65533;s Parental Choice Program (MPCP), public school defenders ask, why should it not work equally well in an exclusively public school context? While this is a serious, legitimate question, it is also intended to raise a another question, one with more explicit political implications: if parents have public school choice, why do they need private school choice as well? As for parental involvement, it is supported by both liberals and conservatives. The logic of that support, however, is different for the two groups. For conservatives, parental involvement is consistent with a philosophy of individual responsibility and accountability, with the investment of authority in individuals and families, and with the divestment of authority from the government.</paragraph><paragraph parID="266">The Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) district, like many of its big-city counterparts in other states, continues to suffer from poor student performance. Proponents of parental involvement argue that even first-rate schools are limited in their effectiveness unless parents are also committed to their children&#65533;s education. As for parental involvement, this can be broken into two types: on-site involvement (at the child&#65533;s school), and at-home involvement. MPS fourth graders performed somewhat better at reading, achieving proficient/advanced levels in the low 60s. Pointing to the importance of parental engagement is a way for the education establishment to downplay schools&#65533; need for self-assessment and continuous improvement. If public schools have performance problems, the argument goes, they can hardly be blamed. The burden for producing desirable educational outcomes really lies with parents, who are responsible for preparing their children to succeed at school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="267">If and when parents are sufficiently engaged with their children&#65533;s education to produce success, only then will public schools deliver the results we expect of them. Turning to parental involvement, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) created a number of new parental involvement requirements for school districts and individual schools. To begin with, each district and school receiving federal Title I funds must have a written parental involvement policy in place. The stated purpose of this requirement is to create avenues for active, sustained parental involvement in children&#65533;s education, particularly types of involvement associated with student achievement and school improvement. At the district level, officials are expected to facilitate parental participation in the development of improvement plans for both the district as a whole and individual schools. The district is also required to provide technical assistance to individual schools in order to enhance their parental involvement programs. Finally, the district must review its parental involvement policy with parents once a year, identifying areas for improvement and strategies for more effective parental engagement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="268">Individual schools receiving Title I funds must convene an annual meeting to inform parents of the various avenues available for their involvement, and must invite them to participate. Thereafter, schools are expected to involve parents, on an ongoing basis, in the planning, review, and revision of school policies and programs. This includes the provision of timely information to parents on school programs and curricula, and on the schools&#65533; processes for setting and measuring student achievement levels. Schools receiving Title I funds must also develop a school-parent compact that outlines schools&#65533; and parents&#65533; respective roles in helping to improve student academic performance. Parents must: have a set of preferences about education and schooling; gather information about the set of schools available to their children;</paragraph><paragraph parID="269">make trade-offs between the attributes of these schools; choose the school that best fits their preferences; monitor the performance of the school to make sure their choice was in fact a good one; and seek a different school for their children if the choice was not correct. [xiv] For many parents&#65533;but particularly those of lower socioeconomic status, with English language deficiencies, and so on&#65533;this can be a daunting process. It can be so daunting, in fact, that some families choose not to choose.</paragraph><paragraph parID="270">This reality is presented insightfully in a discussion of school choice in Britain. The most disadvantaged group of choosers are referred to as &#65533;disconnected&#65533;: They are disconnected from the market in the sense that they are not inclined to engage with it. It is not that these parents have no views about education, or no concerns about schools and their children&#65533;s experiences and achievement. They do, but they do not see their children&#65533;s enjoyment of school or their educational success as being facilitated in any way by a consumerist approach to school choice. Of course, many lower-income, lower socioeconomic status parents do engage in school choice, despite the challenges they may face. For these parents, though, the concern becomes the sufficiency and accuracy of the information they are able to acquire.</paragraph><paragraph parID="271">This is not an indictment of these parents; as noted above, effectively choosing the best school for one&#65533;s child can be a difficult task even for parents with abundant resources. But disadvantaged parents may have less access to quality information, and less experience in evaluating it, than their better educated, more socially-connected counterparts. As parents&#65533; levels of education increase, they rely more on their highly educated friends to supply them with information about schools. It may simply be too difficult for low-income, largely single urban parents (many with limited English proficiency) to learn specific details about their children&#65533;s schools, even given the added incentive of choice. The lack of easy information availability may overwhelm most other factors, whether related to individual ability or to changed motivation from the incentives of choice. It is clear that, although many of the families in this sample attempted to adopt a search strategy which would be most appropriate to their needs, and to employ the information in a manner congruent with a rational choice model, they were not always sufficiently well informed to do this. Yet another concern has to do with the criteria that disadvantaged parents apply when considering schooling options for their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="272">Even if parents have easy access to information, they may base their choice on factors other than school quality, academic rigor, and the presence of experienced, effective teachers. Again, a few excerpts from the relevant literature serve to illustrate: There is growing empirical evidence that parental preferences are very heterogeneous and that low-income parents place lower values on academic characteristics when choosing schools. . . . (T)hese lower preferences for academics have a negative impact on both marginal student outcomes and the pressure for school quality improvement. . . [xx] Working class patterns of educational choice are characterized by ambivalence, and appear to be as much about the avoidance of anxiety, failure and rejection as they are about &#65533;choosing a good school for my child. For liberals, parental involvement serves different political purposes. Because of its receipt of Title I funds, the Milwaukee Public School district must meet the foregoing parental involvement requirements, as must approximately 75 percent of MPS schools, accounting for almost 95 percent of MPS enrollment. [xi] This means that parental involvement programs are nearly universal throughout MPS.</paragraph><paragraph parID="273">Given the commitment to parental choice in MPS and the pervasiveness of parental involvement programs there ought to be grounds for optimism. Unfortunately, these reforms do not always work as advertised. The efficacy of the two reforms can sometimes break along lines of race, class, educational attainment, family composition, income, and ethnicity (or some mix of these, due to the often strong inter-correlations between them). The obstacles to effective parental involvement are more easily explained than those to public school choice, and so will be addressed first. minority or low-income parents are often underrepresented among the ranks of parents involved with the schools. There are numerous reasons for this: lack of time or energy (due to long hours of heavy physical labor, for example), embarrassment or shyness about one&#65533;s own educational level or linguistic abilities, lack of understanding or information about the structure of the school and accepted communication channels, perceived lack of welcome by teachers and administrators, and teachers&#65533; and administrators&#65533; assumptions of parents&#65533; disinterest or inability to help with children&#65533;s schooling. In simpler terms, the more disadvantaged the parent, the less likely he or she is to be involved in a child&#65533;s education, other things being equal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="274">In a district with the demographics of MPS, this should be cause for concern. Table 1 presents some of the relevant data on this point: In most of the categories potentially related to levels of parental involvement, the MPS numbers are substantially less favorable than those in the U.S. at large. The percentages of non-white residents, of households receiving public assistance, and of single-parent families in particular suggest some of the possible demographic challenges to achievement of desired levels of parental engagement in MPS. There is, however, one bit of good news. The research has not established definitive links between socioeconomic variables and parental involvement at home. That is, the evidence is mixed on the question of whether parents with lower income, lower levels of educational attainment, and other disadvantages are less involved in at-home activities such as reading to children, helping them with their homework, etc.</paragraph><paragraph parID="275">Thus, the primary area of concern relevant to parental involvement in MPS would appear to be in the school setting. Turning to public school choice, many of its potential problems are also linked to parents&#65533; socioeconomic status. Disadvantaged parents may not have the time, energy, information, understanding, or confidence to become active, effective public school consumers. Consider this summary of the requirements parents must meet if the public school choice model is to work ideally. Not surprisingly, these attitudes have an impact on parents&#65533; participation in the process of choosing a school: There is little or no attempt to collect information about other schools and little awareness of other schools apart from those within the locality. Choice here means something different from the process gone through by the privileged or the semi-skilled.</paragraph><paragraph parID="276">Choice for these parents typically seems more or less predetermined, often a process of confirmation rather than comparison. A few illustrative excerpts from the research literature follow: When it comes to making use of information about schools. . . education matters a great deal. Less educated parents (who are often non-white) are less able to tap into rich, informal information sources. If in certain circumstances:(1) parents fail to exercise choice altogether; or (2) parents exercise choice, but do so with insufficient or inaccurate information; and/or (3) parents choose schools largely on the basis of non-academic criteria, then public school choice as a tool for boosting school quality and student achievement may very well be a chimera. In addition to the above requirements, Title I lists the following activities that schools may provide with Title I funds. train and support parents to enhance the involvement of other parents;</paragraph><paragraph parID="277">arrange meetings at a variety of times, such as in the mornings and evenings, to maximize the opportunities for parents to participate in school-related activities; arrange for teachers or other educators to conduct in-home conferences with parents who are unable to attend such conferences at school; and adopt and implement model approaches to improving parental involvement, such as Even Start. Title I requires high quality programs to be created and implemented to ensure that all students, in particular, students who are disadvantaged, can acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the 21st century. Title I, with its commitment to high standards and school-wide reform, provides important tools to ensure that students with disabilities who participate in Title I schools or programs receive the benefits of school reform. For more information, see the following Title I Provisions: Policy Guidance for Title I, Part A: Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies , U.S. Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, Compensatory Education Programs, April 1996.</paragraph><paragraph parID="278">Parent Involvement at the State Level State plans must be developed in consultation with parents. District Parental Involvement Policy School districts must work with parents to reach agreement on a parental involvement policy. This parental involvement policy must be incorporated into the district&#65533;s plan and must describe how the district will: provide the coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary to assist participating schools in planning and implementing effective parent involvement; build the schools&#65533; and parents&#65533; capacity for strong parent involvement (See "Building Capacity for Parent Involvement" on page 6.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="279">coordinate and integrate parental involvement strategies with other programs, such as Head Start; and conduct an annual evaluation of the effectiveness of parent involvement. In addition, the law specifically requires local school districts to provide "full opportunities" for participation of parents who are disabled or who have limited English proficiency, including providing information and school profiles in a language and form that such parents understand. Districts receiving over $500,000 in Title I funds must spend at least 1% of this money to facilitate parent involvement, such as through training, materials, or child care at meetings. Parent Involvement at the School Level School Parental Involvement Policy Each school which receives Title I money must have a written parental involvement policy, jointly developed and approved by parents, that describes how the school plans to carry out the requirements of the law.</paragraph><paragraph parID="280">The school should ensure that parents of children with disabilities help to develop the policy. provide parents with timely information about, among other things, programs, school performance profiles, their child&#65533;s individual assessment results, the curriculum, assessments used, and proficiency levels students are expected to meet; and include a school-parent compact. School-Parent Compact - A Component of the School Parental Involvement Policy Each school receiving Title I funds must also develop with parents a school-parent compact that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share the responsibility for improving student achievement. The compact must show how the school and parents will work together to enable children to achieve the state&#65533;s high standards. describe the school&#65533;s responsibility to provide high-quality curriculum and instruction in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables children to meet the state&#65533;s performance standards,</paragraph><paragraph parID="281">describe the ways in which each parent will be responsible for supporting their children&#65533;s learning, and address the importance of ongoing communication between teachers and parents including through parent-teacher conferences, progress reports, and access to staff. Building Capacity for Parent Involvement &#65533;Districts and Schools To build the capacity of parents to participate effectively, Title I requires schools and school districts to undertake the following: Provide training and information to help parents understand the National Education Goals, the states&#65533; content and student performance standards, state and local assessments, the Title I requirements, how to monitor their child&#65533;s progress and work with educators to improve the performance of their children, and how parents can participate in decisions relating to the education of their children. Provide materials and training for parents on coordinating literacy efforts that will help them work with their children to improve their children&#65533;s achievement. Provide opportunities as appropriate and feasible for parents to learn about child development and child- rearing issues designed to help parents become full partners in the education of their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="282">Ensure, to the extent possible, that information about school and parent programs, meetings, and other activities, is provided in the language used in such homes. Provide such other reasonable support for parental involvement activities under this section as parents may request. Changes in 1994 made explicit the intent of the 1988 amendments to Title I that had been designed to ensure that educationally disadvantaged students were educated according to the same high standards states were establishing for all students. promote school-wide reform and ensure access of children (from the earliest grades) to effective instructional strategies and challenging academic content that includes intensive complex thinking and problem-solving experiences; provide greater decision making authority and flexibility to schools and teachers in exchange for greater responsibility for student performance. In contrast, Title I money in targeted-assistance programs may only be used to provide services to eligible children identified as having the greatest need for special assistance. In addition, school-wide programs must provide instruction by highly qualified professional staff, develop mechanisms for meaningful parent involvement, and provide professional development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="283">In targeted-assistance schools, children with disabilities and children with limited English proficiency may already be entitled to services under other federal laws (such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] or Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act [ESEA]) and state laws because of their disability or LEP status. However, a targeted-assistance school may use its Title I funds to coordinate and supplement the services that individual children are already receiving. 6 Consistent with the requirements of IDEA, schools must provide students with disabilities with accommodations needed to participate in the assessments. Coordinate and integrate parent involvement programs and activities with Head Start, Even Start, the Home Instruction Programs for Preschool Youngsters, the Parents as Teachers Program, and public preschool programs and other programs, to the extent feasible and appropriate. Develop appropriate roles for community-based organizations and businesses in parent involvement activities, and encourage partnerships between elementary, middle, and secondary schools and local businesses. Parental Involvement - why would you want to? Notes from a speech made by Eileen Prior, SPTC Executive Director at the "Managing Scotland's Schools" conference on Tuesday 9th November 2010.</paragraph><paragraph parID="284">I chose this title for my talk today because I have heard this said many times since I took up my role, and not always in jest. We are a charity, a membership organisation for parent's groups in Scotland for more than 60 years. We have almost 2,000 member groups all over Scotland - Parent Councils and PTAs primarily. We offer a range of services to our members including insurance, information and advice, workshops/development work. Our office here in Edinburgh receives a steady flow of enquiries from parents: enquiries about the workings of their PC or PTA; calls from parents with concerns about their own child; enquiries about specific aspects of what's happening in education today. We believe this contact with parents puts us in a unique position to talk from the parent's perspective. So why would you want to involve parents?</paragraph><paragraph parID="285">The truth is that parental involvement is viewed by many as a burden to be borne, a challenge to be dealt with, not as a thing of value which has the potential to bring benefit to the school, and most importantly, the child. There has been a good deal of research on the topic and it's clear there are many gains from parental involvement: There's a simple answer as to why parents should be involved: because we know when parents are involved with their children's lives and learning, at home and at school, kids do better at school, they are more likely to stay out of the youth justice system, their life chances are significantly enhanced and of course parents add value, quite simply because they are not simply parents. Like many of you in this room today, parents are also knowledgeable in their area of work, they have skills and talents which can be accessed by the school. They are not simply the mum or dad of wee Jimmy. Parents offer a wide range of things to a school: time; cash; practical support; ideas and fresh thinking and an external view - that of a "critical friend". As Mike Russell said earlier today, parents don't want to run the school, they simply want a meaningful partnership - collegiate working - with schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="286">I would argue that any school which is not geared up to work closely with parents - and by that I mean a two-way process, not simply one-way - is missing out on a huge resource, at a time when we all need to be making maximum use of whatever resources we have. I may be teaching granny to suck eggs, but bear with me. There are two models of parental involvement - spontaneous and intervention. The first has been widely researched (in the US mainly) * but the second has less robust research to measure value. I'm going to focus on the first as the one which is of most interest to us today. There are a number of factors which influence the spontaneous involvement of parents, and for the most part they are entirely predictable: Ethnicity also plays a part: some cultures do not have any tradition of involvement in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="287">In other words the parents who get involved with their child's education and school tend to be: - middle class - in a stable relationship - confident and well - with younger children - white Whatever way you look at it, it's simply not good enough to have such a restricted group of parents involved in education ... whether for the children themselves, or for the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="288">Are we content with this? I'm not, and I feel it is a sorry state of affairs if we are. But we shouldn't think that parents who aren't involved have nothing to give! We should keep in mind that those who don't get involved often have specific issues such as having a difficult educational experience themselves or having specific learning difficulties which make the whole process of engaging with schools very intimidating. We should also remember that what parents do at home can be more important than social class or schooling! So, if we want to involve a wider group of parents - and I think we do - that demands a greater commitment from education authorities and schools as well as CLD, education, social work and other children's services. We need to tailor opportunities to meet the specific needs of children and families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="289">We really need to get our priorities sorted out and make true parental involvement a priority across services. We have seen that we can predict those parents who will - and will not - participate. This demands real commitment to parental involvement from education and other public services. * Impact of Parental Involvement, Parental Support and Family Education on Pupil Achievements and Adjustments: Literature Review, 2003, Charles Desforges and Alberto Abouchaar. A little bit of background about SPTC. So what does parental involvement look like? The social class of the family; mother's educational attainment; level of deprivation in the family; health (particularly mental health); family shape (eg single parent families); the age of the child (the younger the better ... as every high school will tell you); the child's own attainment (almost perversely, the better a child is doing, the more their parents are likely to be involved in the life of the school).</paragraph><paragraph parID="290">Other factors are the role of the child herself as home/school mediator, in other words how she manages that relationship to a large extent. They may have low levels of self confidence and educational attainment, or they could have had difficult interactions with the school in the past. Once bitten, twice shy! From our experience, the situation with parental involvement in Scotland is far from ideal. Support and practice varies widely between authorities and within authorities. It very often comes down to the individual headteacher and how open and committed he or she is - a headteacher who sees information as power and wants to hang onto that power will be reluctant to include parents in a meaningful way, ie beyond fundraising! Parents raise a substantial amount of money for their schools each year, but they have much more to contribute.</paragraph><paragraph parID="291">We know the profile of parents is pretty predictable, and we lose those parents for whose children involvement is most important! And so we get to the nub of the question. What does this mean for different models of school management? I believe if we want parental involvement in different and new models of education we need to get the basics right. We cannot be content with the status quo. This study focuses on parent involvement at one urban public high school, the Boston Arts Academy (BAA), a Pilot School of the Boston Public Schools. Its students perform well on a variety of indicators of student engagement and achievement, and parent attendance at school-based events over the past few years has been consistently high.</paragraph><paragraph parID="292">Parent interviews were separated into two groups, high and medium, which corresponded to parents' engagement levels in school-based activities. Parents who attended more than the two required events and/or were members of the school's Parent Council were included in the "high" category and those who attended the two required events or fewer were included in the "medium" category. Parents were chosen at random from each group to participate in an interview. Researchers read transcripts of all interviews, noted general themes, and then generated a list of codes, including home involvement, school involvement, home-school communication, comfort level, choice, expectations, future goals, likes, and concerns. Transcripts were then coded and analyzed using HyperRESEARCH, a qualitative analysis computer software program. In designing the range of opportunities for parent involvement, staff tried to understand different parent dispositions towards engagement with the school, especially related to cultural values and prior experiences with their children's education. For example, they knew that some parents may not have been welcomed or accustomed to participating in their children's school, while others may have always felt empowered to voice their opinions and participate in every aspect of the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="293">BAA Strategies for Achieving Their Parent Involvement Vision The goal of family involvement at BAA is to maintain open communication among the team of staff, students, and parents, which creates a "safety net" through which students cannot fall. Parent-teacher-student (narrative) conferences Volunteer opportunities, such as providing support at performances Although most parents are committed to attending school-based events that are directly related to student work, they vary greatly in the extent to which they participate in school-based events that are not directly related to student work. In addition to school-based involvement, both high- and medium-involvement parents were actively engaged in their children's lives outside school. Two types of such involvement are (1) talking about life, education, and future goals during times they spend together and (2) providing homework support through assistance with assignments and purchasing materials and supplies. BAA's Strategies Result in Parents' Feeling Well-Informed and Welcomed Parents in general wanted to be involved as much as possible at the school in order to know what was going on with their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="294">Parents are comfortable going into the school and they feel known; for example, teachers and administrators know parents by name and greet them when they are at the school, which many parents said was not always the case at other schools. By focusing on building a diverse, inclusive culture and encouraging parents to take part in the school, BAA engages parents with varied prior experiences and dispositions toward parent involvement.

DISTRICT LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES</paragraph><paragraph parID="295">At the district level, the School Board shall: Provide coordination of various programs which involve parents, technical assistance, and other support necessary to assist every public school in St. Martin Parish in planning and implementing effective parental involvement programs and strategies. Distribute to parents information about the St. Martin Parish School District's parental involvement program, as well as provide proper notification to parents about specific services or special programs, as required by state or federal law. Notification shall also include, at the start of school each year, the right of parents to request and receive timely information on the professional qualifications of their children's classroom teachers. Submit with the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Consolidated Application plan to the Louisiana Department of Education comments of parents of participating children who are not satisfied with components of the parental involvement program. SCHOOL LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES As part of the parental involvement program, the School Board shall encourage each public school and require those schools receiving federal Title I funds under the jurisdiction of the St. Martin Parish School Board to:</paragraph><paragraph parID="296">As part of the parental involvement program, to build a capacity for involvement, the School Board and each public school under the jurisdiction of the  School Board: PARENTS' RESPONSIBILITIES A child's development and success is dependent on the direct support a child receives at home. In an effort to promote responsible and successful parenting skills, the Board expects parents to: Make sure children attend school regularly and arrive at school on time. Assure proper hygiene and daily cleanliness of their children. Make sure children are dressed properly, in accordance with the uniform or dress code.</paragraph><paragraph parID="297">Make sure that children get adequate amounts of sleep nightly. Statement of Compliance SCHOOL-PARENT COMPACT Each school shall jointly develop with parents a school-parent compact that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share the responsibility for improved student academic achievement and the means by which the school and parents will build and develop a partnership to help children achieve the State's high standards. Such compact shall: Describe the school's responsibility to provide high-quality curriculum and instruction in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables the children to meet the state's student academic achievement standards, and the ways in which each parent will be responsible for supporting their children's learning, such as monitoring attendance, homework completion, and television watching; volunteering in their child's classroom; contributing services outside the normal school setting; and participating, as appropriate, in decisions relating to the education of their children, and positive use of extracurricular time. Address the importance of communication between teachers and parents on an ongoing basis through, at a minimum:</paragraph><paragraph parID="298">parent-teacher conferences in elementary schools, at least annually, during which the compact shall be discussed as the compact relates to the individual child's achievement; frequent reports to parents on their children's progress; reasonable access to staff, opportunities to volunteer and participate in their child's class, and scheduled observation of classroom activities; and parental activities and/or contributions away from the school site that enhance academic achievement. OTHER PROGRAMS In conjunction with the district services rendered under the Board's parental involvement program, the School Board shall maintain contact and communication with social service and health agencies, faith-based institutions, and community groups to support key family and community services and issues. In particular, the St. Martin Parish School Board has a strong relationship with and support from community and/or governmental organizations such as Families in Need of Services (FINS), Partners in Education, and District Parent/Teacher Association (PTA).</paragraph><paragraph parID="299">One of the primary goals of these groups is to support, supplement, and assist in improving involvement of parents of children in the St. Martin Parish public schools. Ref: 20 USC 6312 ( Strengthening and Improvement of Elementary and Secondary Schools ) 20 USC 6319 ( Improving the Academic Achievement of the Disadvantaged ) a description and explanation of the curriculum in use at the school, the forms of academic assessment used to measure student progress, and the proficiency level students are expected to meet; Section 1118 of NCLB requires each school district that receives Title I, Part A funds to implement programs, activities and procedures for the involvement of parents. According to the Act, school districts must meaningfully consult with parents of children participating in Title I programs in planning and implementing such programs, activities and procedures. In carrying out the parental involvement requirements school districts and schools, to the extent practicable, must provide full opportunities for the participation of parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities, and parents of migratory children, including providing information and school reports in a format and, to the extent practicable, in a language parents understand.</paragraph><paragraph parID="300">The State Education Department must review the school district's parental involvement policies and practices to determine if the policies and practices meet federal requirements. Each school district must develop jointly with, agree on with, and distribute to, parents of participating children, a written parent involvement policy that must be incorporated into the district's plan. Specifically, the plan must describe how the district will involve parents in the joint development of the district's NCLB plan and the process of school review and involvement. The Act also requires the policy to include other provisions such as, how the district will provide the coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary to assist participating schools in planning and implementing effective parent involvement activities to improve student academic achievement and school performance, and coordinate and integrate parental involvement strategies with parental involvement strategies under other programs, such as the Head Start program, Reading First program, Early Reading First program, and Even Start program. The district must also conduct, with the involvement of parents, an annual evaluation of the parental involvement policy and use the findings of the evaluations to design strategies for more effective parental involvement, and to revise, if necessary, the parental involvement policy. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Question: Are school districts required to use their Title I funds for parent involvement activities?</paragraph><paragraph parID="301">Answer: Each school district must reserve at least 1 percent of the district's basic grant allocation for parent involvement activities, including promoting family literacy and parenting skills, except if 1 percent of such allocation for the fiscal year is $5,000 or less. Parents of children receiving services must be involved in the decisions regarding how these funds are allotted for parental involvement activities. Question: Are Title I schools required to develop parental involvement policies? Answer: Yes. According to NCLB, each Title I school must jointly develop with, and distribute to, parents of participating children a written parental involvement policy, agreed on by such parents. Such policy must be made available to the local community and updated periodically to meet the changing needs of parents and the school. Question: What steps must the school a child attends take to ensure parents are involved?</paragraph><paragraph parID="302">Answer: Each school must invite all parents to an annual meeting, at a convenient time, to inform them of the requirements for school's participation in Title I, including the right of parents to be involved. In addition, each school must involve parents, in an ongoing and timely way, in the planning, review and improvement of Title I programs, including the planning, review, and improvement of the school parental involvement policy and the joint development of the school-wide program plan. A school must also provide parents of participating children - Timely information about programs including a description and explanation of the curriculum in use at the school, the forms of academic assessment used to measure student progress, and the proficiency levels students are expected to meet. If requested by parents, the school must provide opportunities for regular meetings to formulate suggestions and to participate, as appropriate, in decisions relating to the education of their children, and respond to any such suggestions as soon as practicably possible. Question: What is the school-parent compact? Answer: Each Title I school must jointly develop with parents a school-parent compact that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share the responsibility for improved student academic achievement and the means by which the school and parents will build and develop a partnership to help children achieve the State's high standards.</paragraph><paragraph parID="303">This compact must describe the school's responsibility to provide high-quality curriculum and instruction in a supportive and effective learning environment that enables students to meet the State's student academic achievement standards, and the ways in which each parent will be responsible for supporting their children's learning. In addition the compact must address the importance of communication between teachers and parents on an ongoing basis through, annual parent-teacher conferences, frequent reports to parents on their children's progress; and reasonable access to staff, opportunities to volunteer and participate in their child's class, and observation of classroom activities. Question: What activities should the school take to ensure effective involvement of parents and to support a partnership among the school, parents and the community to improve student academic achievement? Answer: According to the NCLB Act, each school district and school must: Provide assistance to parents of children served by the school or local educational agency, as appropriate, in understanding such topics as the State's academic content standards and State student academic achievement standards and State and local academic assessments. Provide materials and training to help parents to work with their children to improve their children's achievement. Educate teachers, pupil services personnel, principals, and other staff, with the assistance of parents, in the value and utility of contributions of parents, and in how to reach out to, communicate with, and work with parents as equal partners.</paragraph><paragraph parID="304">To the extent feasible and appropriate, coordinate and integrate parent involvement programs and activities with other programs such as Head Start, Reading First, Early Reading First, and conduct other activities, such as a parent resource center, and provide such other reasonable support for parental involvement activities as parents may request. In addition, the school and school district may undertake other activities such as, involving parents in the development of training for teachers, principals, and other educators to improve the effectiveness of such training, and paying reasonable and necessary expenses associated with local parental involvement activities, including transportation and child care costs, to enable parents to participate in school-related meetings and training sessions. ADVICE TO LOCAL LEADERS Review parent involvement policies and activities in relation to their impact on teachers and other members of the collective bargaining unit. Examine current parent involvement initiatives such as shared decision making, annual professional performance review plans, and professional development plans to determine where Title I parent involvement activities can be integrated, where appropriate. 9/17/02 - THIS REFLECTS THE LASTEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE.

LEA Responsibilities for Parental Involvement Fair Street IB World School annually surveys parents in the spring to determine the effectiveness and appropriateness of the parent involvement program. The annual evaluation instrument focuses on identifying barriers to parent participation. In addition, schools document parental contacts and activities and submit this report along with the survey to the system level parent coordinator.</paragraph><paragraph parID="315">Information and feedback received from the activities and survey is used to propose new strategies to improve the effectiveness of the parent involvement program. Plan for Involvement of Parents in School Activities Fair Street IB World School outlines a system parent involvement plan designed to invite parents to become full partners in the education of their children through volunteering, parent workshops, English classes, newsletters, PTA/PTO, and School Governance Council. Parental Input/Allocation/Distribution of Funds Parent input on parenting activities and school improvement is welcomed and based on established needs as identified in the parent assessment surveys. No less than one percent of GCSS Title I funds are allocated and expended as outlined by regulations identified and detailed in the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001. Local School Responsibilities for Parental Involvement</paragraph><paragraph parID="316">Title I School Parental Involvement Policy/Plan Fair Street IB World School has a plan for parental involvement. The plan is developed using feedback from parent surveys and feedback. Strategies to increase/improve parental participation are included as part of the school's Title I Plan. The policy is reviewed annually and updated as the school's needs change. Fair Street has a bi-lingual parent coordinator to ensure that limited English proficient parents have every opportunity for full participation in all levels of the school's operation. Annual Meeting/Parental Comments/Amendment</paragraph><paragraph parID="317">Parents receive information about their rights as parents to be involved in their child's education through parental meetings, newsletters, and fliers. All parent comments regarding parental involvement in the school are addressed, and the parent involvement policy is reviewed and amended based on the changing needs of the school, children, and parents. Flexible Meetings Parent meetings are offered at varied times during the day and evening to accommodate parents' schedules. Involving School Councils in Planning and Review School Councils, which have parent representatives, annually review our school Parent Involvement Policies in the spring. Parent surveys/evaluation instruments are used to solicit feedback from parents for policy revisions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="318">Timely Communication and Information to Parents Opportunities are provided throughout the year for parents to receive information about school programs, a description of the curriculum, student assessment, student academic progress, and expected student proficiency at each grade level. Parents are provided opportunities to participate in parent-teacher conferences including parents of special needs students who participate in support team (SST) meetings, individual education plan (IEP) meetings, response to intervention (RTI) meetings and Tribunal meetings.

In addition to these meetings, information is also provided on our school and district websites and in student handbooks/agendas. Strategies for School Improvement Fair Street is responsible for the completion of a School Improvement/Title I Plan. The plan includes a needs assessment, schoolwide reform strategies, professional development, transition plan from one critical grade to the next, measurement with regard to teachers in the decision making process and how to assist students that experience difficulty mastering the proficient or advanced levels of academic achievement standards. Should Fair Street be identified as Needs Improvement, our school leadership team researches the current instructional programs and develops strategies for improvement based on scientifically based research. Opportunities for Regular Parent Meetings</paragraph><paragraph parID="320">The inclusion of parents in all educational areas affecting their children is a goal of Title I. Parents are encouraged to respond to surveys so that days, times, and content of parental workshops and programs are appropriate and accommodating. Fair Street has a school-parent compact on file in the office. The school-parent compact provides opportunities for positive communication between parents and school personnel. The compact is learning-oriented and outlines a plan of action with detailed responsibilities of our school, student, and parent for the purpose of accomplishing high student achievement. Communication between Home and School and Frequent Reports to Parents about Progress Fair Street communicates with parents through newsletters, letters, student agendas, telephone contacts, home visitations, and conferences. Parents receive frequent reports on student progress through progress reports, report cards, home visits, conferences, letters, and Power School.</paragraph><paragraph parID="321">Parents are given reasonable access to school staff via requested conferences (teacher or parent), school visits and volunteering. Ways Parents can Monitor Their Child's Progress and Work Collaboratively with Educators to Improve the Academic/Behavior Performance of Their Child Parents are able to monitor their child's progress and performance through regular contact with the school e.g. conferences, classroom visits, participation in school activities, reviewing all progress reports and report cards, and through Power School.

Involving Parents in Decisions Relating to the Education of Their Child Fair Street involves parents in decision making through membership on the School Governance Council, school-wide planning committees, surveys and the PTA/PTO. In addition to parent-teacher conferences parents are invited to take an active part during SST/IEP and Tribunal meetings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="322">Parents are also involved through their feedback on surveys and needs assessments which address program evaluation. School's Responsibility to High Quality Curriculum Expectations and strategies provide a high quality curriculum for students and is outlined in the school improvement plan. The strategies to be implemented have been taken from scientifically-based research programs with proven success that can be generalized to a specific student population. Building Capacity for Involvement Fair Street IB World School provides opportunities to assist parents in supporting and monitoring their child's progress at home. Parent training includes such topics as "How to Read to Your Child", "How to Support Your Beginning Reader", "You, Your Child, and Math", "Reading Your Child's Signals", "Responding to Your Child's Needs".</paragraph><paragraph parID="323">Our school has lending libraries in the Parent Resource Center. Parents are encouraged to visit the center and check out materials to work with their child at home. Fair Street IB World School's Parent Center offers The Rosetta Stone English Program to non-English speaking parents. Parents are referred by teachers, counselors, and parent coordinator to community programs for assistance. Fair Street IB World School has a parent resource center with hours of operation posted. Opportunities are Provided for Parents to Learn About National Education Goals (NCLB Act of 2001)</paragraph><paragraph parID="324">Through parent meetings, links on school/district web sites, the local media, letters, and conferences parents learn about NCLB.

Research Background Family support for learning is important for all students, but it may be particularly important for children with disabilities. This research digest considers the following questions for secondary-school-age students with disabilities receiving special education:</paragraph><paragraph parID="330">What are the relationships between student and family characteristics and levels of family involvement? NLTS2, a 10-year study, is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education. NLTS2 is a rich source of information on the characteristics, experiences, and achievement of youth with disabilities. The information reported here was gathered from parents or guardians of NLTS2 youth in telephone interviews or through mail questionnaires administered to parents who could not be reached by phone, in the spring and summer of 2001; 9,108 interviews/questionnaires were completed, resulting in an 81% response rate. Comparisons with involvement of families of youth in the general population are calculated from data for 13- to 17-year-olds from the 1996 National Household Education Survey (NCES, U.S. Department of Education). Multivariate analysis techniques (i.e., linear and logistic regression) are used to identify the independent relationships of various family and youth characteristics with differences in levels of involvement. Research Findings</paragraph><paragraph parID="331">Involvement at Home Families of most students with disabilities are very involved in supporting their children's educational development at home. Almost half (45%) of students in the general population receive homework help less than once a week; in contrast, only 24% of those with disabilities receive such infrequent assistance. Involvement in School-Based Activities Families of secondary-school-age students with disabilities participate in a wide range of school-based activities, including schoolwide meetings (e.g., back-to-school nights or PTA meetings), conferences with individual teachers, student or class activities (e.g., attending science fairs or musical performances), and volunteering at school (e.g., chaperoning class field trips or serving on school committees). Overall, 93% participate in at least one of these types of school-based activities. Approximately three out of four parents report attending school meetings (77%) and parent-teacher conferences (73%). Almost two thirds (62%) report attending school or class events. Parents also report volunteering at school, although to a lesser extent than other types of school-based involvement, with about one quarter volunteering.</paragraph><paragraph parID="332">Families of students with disabilities are as involved as their peers in the general population, and for some types of school-based activities-general school meetings (77% vs. 70%) and parent-teacher conferences (73% vs. 56%)-they are more involved. Nearly 9 out of 10 parents of secondary-school-age students with disabilities (88%) report participating in at least one IEP meeting in the current or prior school year. Family attendance at IEP meetings does not always ensure active participation in the decision making process. Slightly more than half of the families report being involved in developing IEP goals. When asked how they feel about their family's involvement in decisions about their children's IEP, about one third want to be more involved. The following are a few highlights: Family involvement varies across disability categories.</paragraph><paragraph parID="333">Youth with emotional disturbances are among the least likely to receive help with homework, and their families, as well as families of students with mental retardation, are among the least likely to participate in three of four types of school-based activities-school meetings, events, and volunteering-but are among the most likely to attend parent-teacher conferences. Negative youth behavior is related to lower levels of family involvement at school and at home. African American students have families who are more likely to be involved at home than their White peers but less likely to be involved at school and to attend IEP meetings. Families of students who are actively involved in extracurricular activities at school are more likely to participate in school-based activities. The more time parents spend on homework support, the less likely they are to be satisfied with their children's schools. Having external supports is related to more frequent family participation. Those who belong to support groups for families of children with disabilities and those who participate in OSEP-supported or other types of training are more likely to support their children's educational development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="334">Families with higher expectations for their children's postsecondary educational attainment are less likely to help with homework but are more likely to be involved at school than families of youth with disabilities who are less optimistic about their children's continued education. Implications for School Practice Families of students with disabilities are highly involved in monitoring and assisting with homework. Parents need information and guidance about how and when to help with homework and how best to support their children's academic work. NLTS2 findings highlight the need for schools and teachers to broaden their focus from programs that bring parents to the school building to programs that support family involvement at home and that expand family expectations, both of which NLTS2 analyses have found to be strongly related to student outcomes (Newman, 2005). Families who are spending the most time helping with homework, such as African American families, often are those who are not coming to the school building. Parent-to-parent programs and support groups also can be particularly effective in providing informational, emotional, and motivational support to families of children with disabilities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="335">Other research has found that only one quarter of schools offer support or parent groups to families of students with disabilities (Schiller et al., 2003). NLTS2 findings point to the importance of providing a forum for parents to share their thoughts and feelings and a place to receive information, support, and encouragement from others who understand what they are experiencing. Ames, C., deStefano, L., Watkins, T., &amp; Sheldon, S. (1995). Teachers' school to home communications and parent involvement: The role of parent perceptions and beliefs . Baltimore, MD: Center on Families, Communities, Schools &amp;amp; Children's Learning. To better support families' involvement in their children's education, schools need to expand the strategies they are using. Teachers' actions can have a strong impact on family involvement (Ames, deStefano, Watkins, &amp; Sheldon, 1995; Hoover-Dempsey &amp; Sandler, 1997).</paragraph><paragraph parID="336">Further, it is important for schools and teachers to be aware of differences among families. These families could benefit from creative outreach, as well as support in their involvement at home. Belonging to these groups is positively associated with family involvement both at home and at school. Hoover-Dempsey, K. V., &amp; Sandler, H. H. (1997). One of Charlotte Country Day School's greatest assets is the time and devotion of our parents and friends of the school. Their countless volunteer hours and tireless fund-raising efforts continue to make a significant difference to the school, ultimately benefiting our students. Parents who volunteer at Country Day not only support the school and meet fellow parents and their families, but they also learn more about the ongoing educational process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="337">By working toward a common goal, parent volunteers often form lasting friendships. Parent volunteers agree "Country Day is more than a school - it's a family of friends." Numerous volunteer opportunities exist for current parents, past parents, alumni, and friends of the school. Parents' Association Many around the CCDS community have noted that the Parents' Association operates like a well-oiled machine. Year after year hundreds of parents take on jobs large and small to raise funds for the school and help build a strong sense of community for the children and their families. Whether parents want to be involved in the classroom or take part in schoolwide activities, fundraisers, or community service, there is something that interests everyone.</paragraph><paragraph parID="338">About the Parents' Association Boards Founded in 1943, the group's organizational structure is split into six boards, with approximately 85 volunteers serving on them. In addition to separate school boards for each division, there is also an Executive Board, Projects Board, and International Board, which all oversee fundraising and fellowship events. Boosters Club The Boosters Club was founded in 1977 to encourage and support strong interscholastic athletic and physical education programs at CCDS. Each year parents volunteer their time and expertise to support our athletes through a variety of fundraising, spirit-promotion, and community-building activities. Boosters organize Spirit Days for all divisions, picture pins for varsity athletes, pizza dinners for Middle School athletes, a Homecoming Cookout, and golf tournament. An annual highlight is the Coaches' Appreciation Dinner at which time the Carl Bolick Award winners are announced.</paragraph><paragraph parID="339">Volunteers stay busy throughout the year selling concessions at sporting events and Special Olympics, managing ticket and merchandise sales, participating in Big Saturday, and producing the Bucsport magazine. One of the primary purposes of the Boosters Club is to assist the school in purchasing athletic equipment that benefits every CCDS student. Coaches and PE teachers submit specific funding requests through an allocation process administered by the Boosters Club Board. Since 2005, more than $450,000 has been allocated to fund items benefitting students. Examples of items funded include: Dowd Field improvements including new scoreboard and filming tower Ed Walton Field scoreboard</paragraph><paragraph parID="340">Middle School scoreboards for softball, baseball, and football/soccer Track and Field equipment Tennis ball machines Field hockey goals and jerseys MS cheerleader practice facility rental Strength and conditioning equipment Girls' lacrosse equipment for Middle School PE</paragraph><paragraph parID="341">Varsity and Middle School softball equipment Middle School baseball equipment Sports video cameras Charter buses for large teams Football helmets State Championship jackets for athletes Lighting for Middle School Gym</paragraph><paragraph parID="342">AED defibrillators In addition, the Boosters Club provides professional development for our coaching staff, supplying funds to attend seminars and workshops. People of Color in Independent Schools (POCIS) is a committee of the National Association of Independent Schools. A local group was established at Charlotte Country Day School in 1998 and is an organization that supports students, faculty, administrators, and parents who believe that diversity and multiculturalism are endemic to quality education for all. The diverse cultures, languages, knowledge, and insights of people of color contribute to creating inclusive and affirming institutions, and POCIS is a forum that promotes dialogue among African American, Latino/Hispanic, Asian/Asian American, Native American, Middle Eastern, Pacific Islander, European American, and multiracial colleagues who support this mission. POCIS supports increasing diversity in independent schools and school climates in which the academic and social well being of all students and adults of color is assured.

(I) Children who are economically disadvantaged, children with disabilities, migrant children or limited English proficient children, are eligible for services under this part on the same basis as other children selected to receive services under this part . . . (B) A child who, at any time in the two years preceding the year for which the determination is made, participated in a Head Start or Even Start program, is eligible for services under this part. The U.S. Department of Education provides this policy guidance on eligibility: "Eligible children are children who are failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet the State&#65533;s challenging student performance standards. Children who are economically disadvantaged, children with disabilities, migrant children, and limited English proficient (LEP) children are eligible for Part A services on the same basis as other children that are selected for services.</paragraph><paragraph parID="344">The overall purpose of Title I is to give schools with high concentrations of children living in poverty the funds to provide special assistance for children who are not achieving well academically or who are at-risk of educational failure. significantly upgrade the quality of instruction by providing staff in participating schools with substantial opportunities for professional development ; afford parents meaningful opportunities to participate in the education of their children at home and at school; distribute resources, in amounts sufficient to make a difference , to areas and schools where needs are greatest; improve accountability , as well as teaching and learning, by using state assessment systems designed to measure how well children served under this title are achieving challenging state student performance standards expected of all children; and Beyond merely setting standards and calling for high expectations, these aspects of Title I spell out what is required to provide meaningful "opportunities to learn." There are two types of Title I programs at the school level: school-wide programs and targeted-assistance programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="345">Be designed to meet the needs of all students, in particular, historically underserved populations. Therefore, a targeted assistance school may not use its Title I funds to pay for services that are mandated under other federal, state, or local law requirements for these children. Local districts must take similar corrective action steps in schools which are not making adequate progress. In addition to addressing the needs of individual children, Title I requires meaningful parent involvement in the design and implementation of entire school programs , making schools accountable to students and their parents. Parents of students with disabilities may use Title I&#65533;s strong parent involvement requirements to ensure that schools are organized and run in ways that respect the rights of students with disabilities, that children are identified who are having difficulty becoming proficient in particular areas, and that there is an effective process for addressing the needs of an individual child having such difficulty. Again, the school should ensure that parents of children with disabilities assist in developing the school-parent compact. With assistance from parents, educate teachers, pupil services personnel, principals and other staff in the value of parents&#65533; contributions, and in how to reach, communicate with, and work with parents as equal partners, implement and coordinate parent programs, and build ties between home and school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="346">Zakiyah Ansari is a parent and community organizer with the Coalition for Educational Justice (CEJ), a citywide collaborative of parents and educators organizing around issues of educational equity in New York City. MY VISION FOR THE FAMILY ENGAGEMENT FIELD I have a vision that my city (New York), state, and country will make a real investment in parent, youth, and community involvement in education. I am a community organizer today because someone took the time to invest in me, help me understand how to facilitate a meeting and organize, and provided me with information on relevant education laws and regulations. I speak in front of parents, Department of Education officials, and other decision makers, but I didn't get to where I am overnight. This investment in community organizing requires taking time to connect with parents where they are. It can't go directly from "Hey, how's Johnny?" to "Let's go to the State Capitol."</paragraph><paragraph parID="347">Some people can make that leap, but usually it needs to go from "How's Johnny?" to "Would you like more information on your school?" and then, "Come to a meeting." It is a long process, but it has the power to shift whole communities. Sometimes the investment is in one parent at a time, but we also have to prioritize investments in community involvement citywide, statewide, and at the federal level. As a parent, I know this process works and that parents will become interested because it is about their kids. Whether or not you speak the language or were born in this country, you want the best for your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="348">Everybody can relate to that. In addition to parents, my vision includes engaging young people in the conversation because they are going to need to fight for change going forward. Success in this field is not just a "win" on one particular issue or another. The richness of our work and the real end result is empowerment. At our most recent lobby day at the State Capitol, we had over 1,400 participants, including parents, community members, and youth. I saw young people excited for the next step, and that is true empowerment. Success is seeing a parent or community member come to an event not thinking they could engage and then becoming totally absorbed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="349">Success is when a parent leaves the meeting asking, "What are we going to do next?" Our goal is not just to get parents to attend any one event, but to support ongoing, sustained parent and community engagement. CURRENT EFFORTS TO ADVANCE THIS VISION Coalition for Educational Justice (CEJ) is a citywide collaborative of parents and educators organizing around educational equity. Parents facilitate our monthly steering committee meetings where we strategize about the core issues such as school closures and the budget, and we prepare for upcoming meetings and events. After the steering committee meetings, parents representing eight local organizations take our discussions back to their communities where our plans are vetted. Community response comes back to us in real time. When we have "wins" and "losses," community members feel them as they happen.</paragraph><paragraph parID="350">Instead of parents' being told what we are going to do, they are part of the planning conversation from the beginning. It is a slow process, but is necessary for getting buy-in. This year, in partnership with the Urban Youth Collaborative, we organized parents and youth at schools that were being closed. We met with school community members to get their feedback on what they wanted to see happen. We made it clear that we could not fight for them. Instead, the question was "Are you ready to fight for your school?" and the answer was, overwhelmingly, "Yes."</paragraph><paragraph parID="351">Folks who had been in the community for 30 years said, "We know what this school was and what it can be." People who didn't want to speak publicly at the beginning became so motivated by what they were hearing, good or bad, that they found their voices. When parents were asked what they thought when 1,500 youth, parents, and teachers led a walk-out at a Panel for Education Policy (PEP) meeting on school closings they said, "It was great, but what is the next step?" One "next step" our parents are now taking is making connections between city-level and state-level policies. CEJ partners with the Alliance for Quality Education (AQE), a statewide organization working on funding equity, to complement our city-level work. AQE and CEJ are working with the same communities-those living in high-poverty areas, immigrant families, and Black and Latino families. AQE is able to share their connections to State Assembly, Senate, and the Board of Regents, allowing us to influence policy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="352">Prior to 2010, we have together helped to prevent $2.4 billion dollars in state education-related budget cuts. CHANGES STILL NEEDED TO HELP ENABLE THIS VISION At the city level, in New York, for example, we need the current administration to commit to involving parents in conversations around what happens in schools. We need a city-level office dedicated to real engagement, parent representation on the PEP, and posters in the subway that send a clear message from the mayor and chancellor to families that our voices and input are needed and respected. A real shift would mean that when parents go to a meeting, they are truly heard and are asked to particpate in further discussion. We also need a shift at the federal level. In the past two years, we have worked with over 30 organizations from across the country on the parent and community engagement piece of the ESEA legislation. Our parents met with congressional representatives and staffers, and realized that policymakers had a limited understanding of the importance of parent engagement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="353">We are working to improve our messaging to advocate for an increased investment in family, community, and youth engagement. Finally, data can take parent passion and experience to the next level. The Annenberg Institute for School Reform supports CEJ by providing data and making research actionable for parents. With school closings, we are provided with such information as: Which communities are these schools in? How are graduation rates? Do they have high percentages of special needs, ELL, or homeless students? We also look at data on schools that might become eligible for closure so that we can proactively engage parents at those schools before closings are announced.</paragraph><paragraph parID="354">Parents can then use this data when presenting and speaking to policymakers to support and strengthen their presentation of their own experiences in their children's schools.

Parents &amp; Schools as Partners Schools Must Encourage Parent Involvement Education World published the following column on the need for schools to encourage parent involvement in their child's education: The school's best ally in the task of nurturing a student's innate 'urge to learn' is, first and foremost, the parents," says Bernie Poole in his online book Education for an Information Age. " A Nation at Risk" (1984) paints a sobering picture when the report states that while parents do have 'an undiminished concern for the well-being of their children,' for the most part they are not culturally encouraged by the education system to intervene in their children's education. Unfortunately, this distancing has not improved in the last 20 years.</paragraph><paragraph parID="360">Working parents, language differences, economic and cultural divisions, and a history of schools regarding parents as intruders and critics rather than partners have built walls. "The responsibility for changing this state of affairs must lie with the schools," Poole adds. But what can educators do to draw parents in, to make them welcome in their children's education? And what can parents do to ensure the teachers not only welcome parent involvement but also accept input in their specific children's classrooms? The old way of thinking was that parental involvement was all about parents. The new way is that it's about student success." -- Dr. Joyce Epstein, Six Types of Parent Involvement</paragraph><paragraph parID="361">Join the conversation Whether you are an educator or parent, tell us your ideas for increasing parent-teacher communication and cooperation.

" Bi- Cultural Recasting Parent Standards Model" This model move parent involvement to parent engagement. This model move parent to action. TYPE I- Access to Information and Data Collection Parents need to have access to timely and accurate information in order to best support their children's academic success. This includes: &#8226; Parents using, analyzing, and collecting data about their schools &#8226; Parents understanding data and using data that drives reforms &#8226; Parents becoming empowered to investigate and document conditions in their schools by becoming researchers in their own communities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="363">In Epstein's Six Keys Steps she does not mention anything regarding data collection. We now live in a data driven society and failure to acknowledge this places parents of color at a disadvantage. Type 1 involvement in our model is also aligned with the intention of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), section 1118, and the California School Accountability Report Card (SARC). This element is also driven by the principle that an informed parent is a powerful parent for social change. TYPE II- Parents in Decision-Making Roles Parents provide leadership in schools by being at the table with teachers and administrators in multiple ways. For example, they actively set policies and are involved in key decisions along with school leaders.</paragraph><paragraph parID="364">In addition, parents provide training and evaluation of school structures. Finally, decision making must incorporate input from families and the community. Parents in decision making roles should include: &#8226; Local Advisory Committees with genuine parent participation &#8226; Effective advocacy and education as a direct result of understanding how systems are structured (e.g. how decisions and power are distributed between schools, staff, parents and students) &#8226; Providing parents with knowledge, skills, and opportunities to actively engage them in all levels of the decision-making process &#8226; Representation of parents on the school decision-making teams Joyce Epstein addresses decision-making in her six types of parent involvement. However, in our estimation, her view of decision-making is too general; it lacks content or suggestions on what it should look like in practice. In other words, it is left too open to interpretation, thus exclusively in the hands of educator who often are the ones who define what parent involvement is.</paragraph><paragraph parID="365">In other words, this lack of clarity leaves too much up to school authorities to decide what this decision-making should look like. Our Type 2, is similar in some sense to Joyce Epstein's Type 5, "Decision Making. TYPE III-Parents as Student Advocates Parents need to know how to navigate and negotiate the school system. We need to support the creation of an environment where parents have access to information and support systems to be effective advocates by monitoring and directing the education of our children. &#8226; Parents need to know what children need, how to access resources and how to implement a plan of action. &#8226; Parents need to understand a power map detailing the functions and structures of the system.</paragraph><paragraph parID="366">&#8226; Parents need to understand and be able to communicate in an educational setting, using terms spoken by educational professionals. Our Type 3 of parent involvement is often not addressed in other parent involvement models, Epstein, Comer, etc. We argue that parents from working class communities need to know how to engage professional educators if they are going to be public participants in their children's education. Only when parents know the rules of engagement, particularly the language of education, can they hold the system accountable. TYPE IV-Parents as Leaders at Home and in the School-Community Parents need opportunities to build leadership and advocacy skills to enhance student-parent-community partnerships. Schools will serve the family and community needs for health and social service and provide resources and information for accessing those services.</paragraph><paragraph parID="367">&#8226; Parents will learn intergenerational and cross-cultural communication strategies, with a special emphasis for immigrant families. &#8226; Parents will learn "21st century parenting skills" such as how to develop boundaries, parent-child communication, identify risk factors (e.g. drugs and gang involvement.) &#8226; Parents will understand the college requirement and financial aid process. &#8226; Leadership training will be offered that will include meeting facilitation, public speaking, conflict resolution and cross cultural training &#8226; Communications training for parents will be more effective in navigating their children through K-12 to college. &#8226; Parents receive on-going support and technical assistance to equip them for effective participation. Epstein does discuss parent roles, but it is limited in content and context. In our summation, there is no room in Epstein's model to broaden the content to go beyond homework to address urban parents' needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="368">Parents in urban schools, however, need equal resources in the area of gang influences, drug problems, and criminal activities that go beyond basic parenting skills. TYPE V- Effective Two -Way Communication Communication in multicultural and multilingual communities must be translated in languages that parents speak in their home. Communication between home and school must not only be a regular, two-way occurrence, it also has to be relevant and meaningful. These multicultural and multilingual ways of communicating with parents must include, but not be limited to, the computerized machines, newsletters, personal contact, letters/flyers, and the school marquee. Parent Liaison roles in multicultural school must also help bridge open communication between school and home and help create effective home /school relationships. This includes the cultural awareness to ably work with parents of diverse cultural, linguistic, and economic backgrounds and experiences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="369">In many urban and multicultural communities, the Parent Liaison role is the key to fostering relationships with parents and open communication between schools and communities. There is, however, no relationship more important than that between parents and teachers and that is the idea behind The Urban Parent Teacher Education Collaborative. The Urban Parent Teacher Education Collaborative is a pioneering model for others universities. By creating a space for a university professor and a grass-roots parent organizer to team-teach a class for pre-service teachers, Pepperdine University has recognized parents as experts in the area of how and what is needed to educate children in urban schools. This new model allows future teachers to have contact with urban parents before they come into our school communities. In workshops, pre-service teachers are given strategies for interacting with parents in order to learn how to build a working relationship with them. PUT members and teachers, for example, practice role reversals that allow both teachers and parents to acquire a better understanding and respect for the importance of each other's roles.</paragraph><paragraph parID="370">This distinct model of teacher education seeks to build a clinical laboratory for teacher preparation driven by parent involvement with the following goals: &#8226; To increase and sustain teacher's knowledge, skills and positive attitudes toward families through their participation in a community-dialogue forum with urban parents. &#8226; To move beyond classroom-based teaching methods by offering teachers direct field experiences working with families. &#8226; To enable pre-service teachers to develop effective practices to prepare their work with families and communities. &#8226; To establish a context for pre-service teachers to learn about urban communities. &#8226; To increase working relationships between novice-residence teachers with families and students which break down perceptions of stereotypes and improves student achievement. TYPE VI-District Level Support Structures must be provided to build parent capacity that is well-defined and where meaningful participation such as dialogue, empowerment and action are critical components of educational reform.</paragraph><paragraph parID="371">This mid-level structure will be fully funded and led by parent councils that will: &#8226; Provide parents with training and capacity building opportunities to effectively engage in school reform at the local and district level. &#8226; Provide parents with information and resources to meet the needs of the whole child. &#8226; Enable parents to support students and schools programs. We acknowledge that in Epstein's six types of parent involvement does engage the issue of parent participation at the district level, including the establishment of "independent advocacy groups" that will serve to lobby for school reform and improvements (National Network for Partnership in Schools, 2006). Our type 6 aligns loosely with Epstein's type 5 of parental involvement. TYPE VII- Friendly Schools Atmosphere</paragraph><paragraph parID="372">Schools will post welcome signs throughout the school in many languages including English. The staff of each school will provide mandatory customer service every year for the entire school. Parents will be asked to fill out a survey on services render. A friendly school atmosphere was also left out of Epstein's six keys that were adopted by the State of California. The number one complaint in urban schools from parents is that the school staff is rude and unfriendly. This is the major reason parents give for not participating or volunteering at local schools. Mary Johnson, President Parent-U-Turn www.californiaparents.net</paragraph><paragraph parID="373">3 Monday, 29 June 2009 07:15 Too many teachers tell parents what's wrong with the child, but don't involve the parents in deciding how to remedy the situation. And, who knows the child better than the parent? 2 Friday, 26 June 2009 16:53 Teachers need better training on how to conduct parent-teacher conferences. Some of them talk and don't listen. Others think parents only want to know about grades.</paragraph><paragraph parID="374">Others talk to parents like they're young children. It starts with good listening skills and then zeroing in on the parent's interest. 1 Friday, 26 June 2009 10:41 I think all teachers should have a website so parents can find out what's going on regularly. It would be great if I could talk to other parents on issues affecting our kids in a particular teacher's class - but not at a meeting. I don't have time for meetings. I'm always on my computer and could talk via IM or a forum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="375">The teacher would be a part of this discussion as well. In addition, Title I schools must make their parent involvement policy available to the local community and update it periodically to meet the changing needs of parents and the school. To the extent practicable, both the district and its Title I schools will provide full opportunities for the participation of parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities, and parents of migratory children. Activities in this area include providing information and school reports in a format and, to the extent practicable, in a language such parents understand. assist parents in understanding such topics as the state's academic content and student achievement standards, state and local academic assessments, Title I requirements, and how to monitor a child's progress and work with educators to improve the achievement of their children; provide materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their children's achievement, such as literacy training and using technology, as appropriate, to foster parental involvement; educate teachers, pupil services personnel, principals, and other staff, with the assistance of parents, in the value and utility of parent contributions, and in now to reach out, communicate with, and work with parents as equal partners, implement and coordinate parent programs, and build ties between parents and the school;</paragraph><paragraph parID="376">The district and its schools may also consider other activities that further build the capacity of parents to become involved, to the extent those activities are feasible and appropriate. To ensure effective involvement by parents and to support a partnership among the school involved, parents, and the community to improve student academic achievement, both the district and each of its Title I schools will: to the extent feasible and appropriate, coordinate and integrate parent involvement programs and activities with Head Start, Reading First, Early Reading First, Even Start, the Home Instruction Programs for Preschool Youngsters, the Parents as Teachers Program, and public preschool and other programs. They will also conduct other activities, such as parent resource centers, that encourage and support parents in more fully participating in the education of their children. In accordance with the NCLB, these additional optional activities may include, for example, the establishment of a district-wide parent advisory council to provide advice on all matters related to parental involvement in Title I programs, and training parents to enhance the involvement of other parents.

Parents must notify their child's school principal annually in writing if they do not want such information released to the entities noted above. Unless notification is put in writing by a parent, the same information may also be used in district publications, including the district newsletter and on the district website. It is the intent of the district to strongly encourage students to be in attendance every day. All children of compulsory age must attend school on a regular basis.

Additionally, the Board directs that each district school with a program served with Title I funds to jointly develop with, and distribute to, parents of participating children a written parental involvement policy. The policy must be agreed on by such parents and describe the means for carrying out NCLB parental involvement requirements set forth below. Each Title I school must notify parents of its parent involvement policy in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, in a language the parents can understand. Although getting parents involved in their children's schools is a great challenge for educators, research shows that educators can do a great deal to promote greater parent involvement. The Center on Families, Communities, Schools, and Children's Learning (1994) indicates that parents who receive frequent and positive messages from teachers tend to become more involved in their children's education than do other parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="381">Dauber and Epstein (1993) found that many parents respond to encouragement from educators. In their national study of 2,317 inner-city elementary and middle school students, the best predictor of parent involvement was what the school did to promote it. School attitudes and actions were more important than the parents' income, educational level, race, or previous school-volunteering experience in predicting whether the parent would be involved in the school. Davies (1991) suggests three ways that schools can promote parent involvement : establishment of a parent center, a home visitor program, and action research teams. School attitudes and actions toward parent involvement are largely influenced by administrators and teachers. Because leadership is critical, administrators may need special training to help them develop the skills needed to promote family-school partnerships. Don Davies, former U.S. Commissioner of Education and former president of the Institute for Responsive Education, states, "In any school...leadership is essential if a school staff is to choose the partnership approach to school reform.... In most cases, the leadership to reach out to the community will have to come from the principal" (Davies, 1991, p. 382).</paragraph><paragraph parID="382">Teacher-parent partnerships foster mutual support for teacher and parent roles, increase parent involvement in various school activities and improvement projects, and lead to positive growth for students (Swick, 1991). To promote such partnerships, the Family Involvement Partnership for Learning suggests that members of the school community develop a family-school compact for learning . Such a compact can capture the sustained effort required for successful partnerships. Accommodate parents' work schedules when creating parent-involvement opportunities. Assign homework projects that engage each child's parents and family and make learning more meaningful for the student, such as a family history, interviews with grandparents, or descriptions of parents' daily work. Keep parents informed of their children's performance and school activities by means of notes, telephone calls, newsletters, conferences, and meetings. Provide clear, practical information on home-teaching techniques for parents of children who need extra help at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="383">Provide opportunities for parents to visit the school, observe classes, and provide feedback. Allow employees occasional time during the work day to attend school conferences or volunteer at their children's schools. Develop work strategies that enable parents to become involved in schools. IMPLEMENTATION PITFALLS: For working parents, time constraints often prevent school involvement. Sixty-six percent of working parents indicate that they do not have enough time for their children (Families and Work Institute, 1994). Educators should make every attempt to plan school meetings, activities, and conferences at times when parents are available to attend. Employers need to be flexible with the work schedules of working parents and supportive of their efforts to be involved in their children's schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="384">Some parents may have other reasons for not being involved with their children's schools: "A growing number of parents do not speak or read English well enough to communicate with teachers and administrators. Because of cultural differences, many parents are not familiar with the expectations of their children's schools and don't understand how to go about getting involved, even if they want to. Some parents lack the educational background or skills they feel they need to interact with teachers and staff. For others, their own negative experiences as students make them uncomfortable going to the school." OVERVIEW: Traditionally, parent involvement in education has included home-based activities (such as helping with homework, encouraging children to read, and promoting school attendance) and school-based activities (such as attending PTA meetings, parent-teacher conferences, concerts, and other school events; helping to raise money for various school-improvement projects; and volunteering at school during the day). Epstein (1995) expands upon the traditional kinds of involvement by identifying six types of parent involvement in schools : parenting, communicating, volunteering, learning at home, decision making, and collaborating with the community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="385">Each type of involvement is valuable, and each has an impact on students, teachers, and the parents themselves. Other parents are reluctant or unable to participate. The language barrier may be a problem for parents who do not speak English. One solution is to have a resource person--either a teacher or another parent--who can communicate with the parents in their first language (Ballen &amp; Moles, 1994). Another possible solution is to have children accompany their parents and act as translators at conferences and meetings. Some parents lack the ability to read or are embarrassed about their lack of schooling. Educators should realize that not all parents are able to read newsletters, field trip forms, or homework assignments.</paragraph><paragraph parID="386">They must not depend on the written word as the only form of communication with the home. Home visits, phone calls, one-on-one meetings, and other personalized contacts with parents are important. Teachers who feel overburdened with their teaching load may not have the time to reach out to parents. They need to be given the necessary time to contact and meet with parents. To coordinate parent-teacher meetings and develop parent-involvement programs, the school may designate a parent liaison or home-school coordinator (Ballen &amp; Moles, 1994). Sometimes parents are frustrated because schools do not seem to know much about their children. Boyer (1995) notes, "The harsh truth is...that car mechanics often know more about the automobiles entering their shops than educators know about children who enroll in school" (p. 61-62).</paragraph><paragraph parID="387">It is important for schools to offer different forms of parent involvement; no one form of involvement is necessarily right for every family. Educators and parents should aim to increase the percentage of parents involved in at least some ways. Every school has at least some parents who are deeply involved; the key is to steadily increase this number. DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW: Although most educators and parents say they support parent involvement in schools, many parents appear to support a wider range of involvement opportunities than do educators. Various studies show that parents want to be more involved, and in a broader variety of ways (Williams &amp;amp; Stallworth, 1984; Elam 1990). Educators sometimes are reluctant to have parents involved in decision-making roles with the school. A recent Gallup poll (Elam, 1990) asked parents if they were satisfied with the amount of participation they had in their school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="388">Fifty-nine percent said they wanted a greater voice in the way school funds were allocated, 53 percent said they wanted more say in what courses were offered, and 46 percent said they wanted more say in hiring administrators (versus 37 percent who said they had the right amount of say in hiring administrators). See, for example, Professor Charles Desforges (with Alberto Abouchaar), &#65533;The Impact of Parental Involvement, Parental Support and Family Education on Pupil Achievements and Adjustment: A Literature Review,&#65533; Research Report RR433, Department for Children, Schools and Families, Government of the United Kingdom, June 2003; Anne T.

Results like these have led to a veritable cottage industry dedicated to improving educational outcomes in Milwaukee. These options include: inter-district choice&#65533;a system allowing parents to choose among schools in multiple districts; charter schools&#65533;public schools that are exempt from select state and local requirements that govern more traditional public schools. By way of contrast, Competition will result in improved school effectiveness, productivity, and service, leading to higher quality education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="390">PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT This engagement can take a variety of forms, including: attending general school meetings; attending a school or class event; There is, however, a consensus around the idea that at-home involvement is considerably more productive than on-site involvement at the child&#65533;s school. (Though one may not often think of public schools as &#65533;the government,&#65533; they are in fact just that.) Student test scores and dropout rates are at deplorable levels, both in absolute terms and in comparison with the rest of Wisconsin.</paragraph><paragraph parID="391">This fact has led to a veritable cottage industry dedicated to improving educational outcomes in Milwaukee. estimate of MPS choice parents choosing from among two or more schools: 44.4 percent Taken together, these three estimates allow one to perform calculations regarding a hypothetical &#65533;ideal consumer&#65533; in a public school choice system. This consumer would maximize the marketplace pressures on schools, thereby creating the greatest prospects for school reform and student achievement. Students nine years old or younger: 24.6 percent Test results released in May of 2007 serve to illustrate. Advocates of parental involvement argue that choosing an appropriate school for a child is not enough.</paragraph><paragraph parID="392">That, in any case, is an argument one hears among advocates of public education. PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE AND PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT WITHIN MPS A key finding in the parental involvement literature is as follows: A story in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel recently noted that &#65533;parents might have more choices in publicly funded education in Milwaukee than anywhere else in the United States. [vii] This claim applies to both private school choice&#65533;that is, the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program&#65533;and public school choice. As for the latter, MPS has an intra-district choice program through which parents may list up to three schools they would like their children to attend. Nearly 17,000 parents took advantage of this option in 2006, and almost 95 percent received their first choice assignment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="393">[viii] Milwaukee parents also have a variety of different school options from which to choose. Finally, Title I schools must provide instruction, training, and materials to parents to help improve the level and quality of their involvement in their children&#65533;s education. Limits to the two theories of reform Factors such as facilities, distance, and convenience may be of prime concern to the disconnected chooser. In contrast to the issues of child personality, school policy, and teaching methods important to privileged/skilled parents, disconnected parents must address material matters. They are more confident choosing on the basis of the realities of school physical plant and facilities. DATA ANALYSIS</paragraph><paragraph parID="394">Data sources and methods This section offers estimates of the extent and nature of public school choice and parental involvement within the Milwaukee Public Schools district. The basic approach was to identify the determinants and frequency of parental choice and parental involvement using a national data set, and extrapolate those results to Milwaukee, relying on the particular demographics of the MPS district. The national data set is the U.S. Department of Education&#65533;s 2003 Parent and Family Involvement in Education survey, part of the National Household Education Surveys (NHES) program. The specific demographic variables used to extrapolate from the national survey to MPS were as follows: educational attainment of parents, race and ethnicity of students,</paragraph><paragraph parID="395">household composition (single-parent vs. two-parent), and mother&#65533;s employment status. For each estimate given below, the analysis was limited to students enrolled in public schools (rather than private schools, or home-schooling arrangements) in grades one through twelve. The methods used to make the extrapolations and arrive at the specific estimates are explained in detail in the Methodology Appendix. As noted above, for parents who have a choice among two or more public schools, the threshold decision is whether or not to make a choice. In theory, the more parents who exercise their option to choose, the more the education system will operate like a marketplace, and the greater the impact on school improvement and student achievement will be. The first estimate is as follows:</paragraph><paragraph parID="396">Estimate of MPS parents actively choosing a school for their child: 33.6% [xxiii] Based on the data and methods described above and in the Methodology Appendix, it is estimated that just under 35 percent of MPS parents actively choose a school for their child, rather than simply opting for the default neighborhood school. For the sake of simplicity, this group will be referred to as &#65533;choice parents&#65533; below. "Do parents know how and what they can do to ensure their children's success? Do they understand how the school and home can work in harmony for the good of both" (Campbell, 1992, p. 1)? It is possible that a lot of parents do the best they can, but simply do not know the answers to these questions. They want to help their children achieve success, but do not know how to go about doing that.</paragraph><paragraph parID="397">Reginal Clark conducted research on students who were classified as high achievers and discovered that these students shared ten common characteristics (Campbell, 1992). These ten characteristics can provide a blueprint for families to be more effective in their roles of ensuring their children greater success in school. 1. A feeling of control over their lives. 2. Frequent communication of high expectations to children. 3.</paragraph><paragraph parID="398">A family dream of success for the future. 4. Hard work as a key to success. 5. An active, not a sedentary, lifestyle. 6. Twenty-five to 35 home-centered learning hours per week.</paragraph><paragraph parID="399">7. The family viewed as a mutual support system and problem-solving unit. 8. Clearly understood household rules, consistently enforced. 9. Frequent contact with teachers. 10.</paragraph><paragraph parID="400">Emphasis on spiritual growth. (Campbell, 1992, pp. 2-3) The important person is the student. Anything that the parent can do to help the student improve is worth doing. "Emphasis should be on effective ways of helping children, families, and schools work together to provide students with the opportunity to put their best efforts forward" (Duncan, 1992, p. 13). It is very clear that parental involvement is beneficial. It can definitely benefit the student in question, but it can also benefit the teachers, the school, the parents themselves, and the community, as well as other children in the family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="401">Everything possible should be done by the school system to encourage the parents to become involved. This is especially true of the principal of the school. He or she is the driving force of the school, and it is his or her leadership that will guide the teachers in the direction of emphasizing the importance of parental involvement. Education and Parental Involvement in Secondary Schools: Problems, Solutions, and Effects Jeri LaBahn Source: LaBahn, J. (1995). Education and parental involvement in secondary schools: Problems, solutions, and effects. Educational Psychology Interactive .</paragraph><paragraph parID="402">Valdosta, GA: Valdosta State University. Retrieved [date] from  http://www.edpsycinteractive/files/parinvol.html Parental involvement is a combination of commitment and active participation on the part of the parent to the school and to the student. There are many problems concerned with involvement. Many secondary schools simply do not know how to deal with the nontraditional family and the areas of concern that it represents. Parents feel unwelcomed at school, lack knowledge and education, and may not feel that education is important. The number of solutions that can be used to improve parental involvement are substantial.</paragraph><paragraph parID="403">The most important of these, however, is for the principal of the school to be totally committed. When these solutions are implemented the effects are great, especially for the student. Improved student achievement is the key objective. Education and Parental Involvement in Secondary Schools: Problems, Solutions, and Effects "Parental involvement, in almost any form, produces measurable gains in student achievement" (Dixon, 1992, p. 16). The concept of parental involvement with the student and the school is a vital one and can produce great rewards for all concerned. However, it has been found that schools do not always know what the term parental involvement really means (Vandergrift &amp; Greene, 1992).</paragraph><paragraph parID="404">The other element needed is a level of parental activity and participation, such as doing something that is observable. "This combination of level of commitment and active participation is what makes an involved parent" (Vandergrift &amp; Greene, p. 57). Parent involvement actually declines as students grow older, so that it is less in secondary schools than in elementary (Stouffer, 1992). If parental involvement is so beneficial, why isn't it being used to a greater extent than at present? There are many reasons from the parent and also from the school for this lack of involvement. One of the reasons concerns the lack of understanding of nontraditional families on the part of the school system. The nontraditional family is struggling to deal with many factors that affect every member of the family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="405">These can definitely affect the way that the family is able to be involved in the student's education. More than likely, there is a shortage of time. There just simply are not enough hours in the day to accomplish everything. If there has been a divorce or death in the family, there probably has been a change in the financial standing of the family. By the school not being sensitive to this change, the student/family could be embarrassed. The verynature of the family structure is in a state of change causing confusion and insecurity (Duncan, 1992; Lewis, 1992; Wanat, 1992). The parents may be doing the very best that they can.</paragraph><paragraph parID="406">"Schools must understand that lack of participation by parents does not necessarily mean they are neglecting their responsibilities. They simply may not have the time, resources, or know-how to help out" (Wanat, p. 47). Parents often do not feel welcomed at school. They feel that what they may have to offer is unimportant and unappreciated. Also, parents may not believe that they have any knowledge that the school is interested in knowing. This is especially true when the parent may not have a great deal of education (Dixon, 1992; Vandergrift &amp; Greene, 1992). It is also possible that the parent does not have a great deal of interest in the school or his child's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="407">The parent may not feel that education is important (Vandergrift &amp; Greene). Another reason for lack of involvement is embarrassment. The parents may be illiterate or unable to speak English. This could make communication difficult if not impossible. Another source of embarrassment is memories of the parent's failure in school. The parent would not have much desire to return to a place that only served to remind him of his own failures (Brink &amp; Chandler, 1993; Smith, 1991). "Principals are key contributors to helping parents and other educators understand each other" (Duncan, 1992, p. 13).</paragraph><paragraph parID="408">"Ultimate responsibility for creating harmony between the school and the home rests with the principal" (Campbell, 1992, p. 3). By the school being more aware of the circumstances of nontraditional families, better communications can be established. One thing that the school can do is to let the parents handle parenting responsibilities and the school handle the educational responsibilities. Also, by working with the parents more, the school will have a better idea of what the parents can and cannot do. More realistic expectations for out-of-school projects is an example of this (Wanat, 1992). Single parents often do not have the time, money, or knowledge to help children with projects. For example, many mothers do not have equipment or skill to plan science fair experiments or construct woodworking projects, and fathers may not be able to help design and sew costumes for the school play (Wanat, 1992, p. 46).</paragraph><paragraph parID="409">Another important item is communication. More communication between the school and home are needed, but specific types of communication are important. Two-way informal exchanges between teacher/parent are much more effective than one-way communication from the teacher (Wanat). Also, friendly contact should be established with parents early in the year before something has happened that makes it necessary for the teacher to contact the parent (Wherry, 1992). One way is for the school to sponsor a parent/student fund raising. Parents and students working side-by-side gives them a chance to talk, and hopefully the teachers and schools will also be included in this important exchange. Also, parent/teacher organizations can be an avenue to reach parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="410">Parents who attend parent/teacher meetings are able to get to know their child's teachers better. Another avenue sometimes overlooked is inviting parents to volunteer. By doing this, the school is letting them know that they are wanted, needed, and welcomed at the school. Many parents are more than willing to share their knowledge of occupations, foreign travel, special skills and hobbies. They just want to be asked. Alumni events have been shown to be an excellent way to improve parent/community involvement and a way to raise needed money. Former students may appreciate the opportunity to return something to their school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="411">One popular program is parent classes, which can help parents with parenting ideas/problems, homework/tutoring strategies, drug education, and improving communications skills. These classes can help the parent, student, and school. Invitational events can encourage people to get involved with the school that might not otherwise. Grandparent day is one such invitational event that has met with success (Loucks, 1992; Stouffer, 1992; Wherry, 1992). An open house program at school can bring in parents, and it is very important to greet these visiting parents face-to-face as quickly as possible. Also, greeting visitors with a sign in their own language can make a big impression. Find out the languages spoken by students and parents and put up a sign with all languages on it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="412">Another way to help parents feel genuinely wanted and welcomed is to establish parent advisory groups. People like to know that their input is valued. Also, the school could set up a parent center in the school stocked with resources to help parents. This is one way the school can say we care. In addition, the school could recognize what parents are doing to help the students and praise them for their efforts. People like to know that someone takes the time to notice and appreciate what they were doing (Wherry, 1992). One very important way that parents can become involved in their student's work is through the use of computers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="413">This is a new world opening up for a lot of students as well as their parents. They can learn about this exciting world together. One thing that is necessary is to make sure the programs used are at the correct grade level and that there is a lot of variety (Rickelman &amp; Henk, 1991). There are several things that have been suggested for populations that are at-risk. These populations have a great number of uneducated people, drug addicts, alcoholics, and child abusers. The ideas already presented may not work for this sector of the population, and they may need special consideration. The first thing the school can do is to meet the parents where they are by assessing the parent's needs and providing programs to meet those needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="414">Having a workshop on Good Parenting Skills in English simply will not work when offered in a district in which Spanish is the main language spoken. The school will need to make a greater effort to get to know the parents individually. Someone from the school may actually have to go door-to-door to make the invitation as personal as possible so that the parents will feel welcomed. Also, the school should "offer a broad range of activities to encourage support and participation, including nonthreatening, low-commitment opportunities" (Vandergrift &amp; Greene, 1992, p. 59). Making the parents feel as comfortable as possible is an important step. Results from the Arizona At-Risk Pilot Project suggest that the most effective means to involve parents are ones that (1) establish a personal rapport between someone from the school and the parent and (2) do not initially require high levels of commitment or participation (Vandergrift &amp; Greene, 1992, p. 59). When parents, students, and the school work together, it is possible to accomplish great things at the secondary level.</paragraph><paragraph parID="415">Everyone reaps the benefits! "When both parents and teachers work together, communicate and build a family and school partnership, parents, teachers and children benefit from the outcome" (Gelfer, 1991, p. 167). The main benefit of parental involvement is the improved achievement of the student. According to Loucks (1992), "Research shows that parent involvement in the school results in improved student achievement" (p. 19). There it is in a nutshell: if the parent shows concern, it will translate into greater achievement on the part of the student. The more that the parent becomes involved with the teacher, school curriculum, and administration, the better the parent feels about the school. The parent will have an increased sense of pride in the school and the community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="416">The more the parent learns about the way the school functions, the more the parent will understand the educational process and educational decisions. The parents and the school become allies and are able to be of mutual benefit when it comes to dealing with difficult students and situations. The parents are also more supportive of the school with financial support as well as support of bond issues and other leeway levies (Stouffe, 1992). The more the parent becomes involved and learns about the school, the more the parent can help the student. The parents are able to "increase their understanding of child development in areas of physical, social, emotional and cognitive development" (Gelfer, 1991, p. 164). This helps to provide a bond between home experiences and the educational program. When the parents understand how the child develops, they are better able to provide a more positive and exciting home environment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="417">The parents may even want to learn more and possibly attend the parent classes provided by the school. This type of situation can produce a positive spiral of success for the parent, school, and student (Gelfer). This includes such things as encouraging the student, being sympathetic, reassuring, and understanding. There are many things that can be done to improve parental involvement at the secondary level, but the success of any program will be tied directly to the support and encouragement of the principal (Lewis, 1992). There has been extensive research done on this subject. However, new ways for increasing parental involvement can always be discovered. Available online: [http://chiron.valdosta.edu/whuitt/files/parinvol.html]</paragraph><paragraph parID="418">According to Vandergrift and Greene, there are two key elements that work together to make up the concept of parental involvement. One of these is a level of commitment to parental support. There are many ways that a school can improve communications. Recent major legislation, such as the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), has made parents' involvement in their children's education a national priority. School districts nationwide are being encouraged to reexamine their parent involvement policies and programs and to demonstrate innovative approaches in order to obtain Federal education dollars. SEPARATION OF THE EFFECTS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT The Cohoes City School District believes that regular school attendance and student success have a direct correlation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="419">In the case of a student's absence from school, parents are required to call the main attendance office at their school by the start of the school day to inform them of the reason for the student's absence. Otherwise, the school will make every reasonable attempt to contact the parents regarding the student's absence. Without a note, the student's absence from school is deemed unexcused. The following are some reasons considered to be excused absences from school: illness - self/family; a death in the family; religious observance; court or legal appointment or a doctor/dentist appointment. Information about the school breakfast and lunch program, including the district Wellness Policy and monthly menus, is available by visiting the Food Service section of the website. Free/reduced meal applications are available at any time during the school year. Some schools will be surveyed by the state Department of Health each year and asked to share the number of pupils they have in each of six possible BMI categories based on students' age and sex.</paragraph><paragraph parID="420">If our district is surveyed by the state, we will only share group data (for instance, the number of second-grade boys whose BMI is below the fifth percentile), not individual data. However, if parents wish their child's data to be excluded from such group calculations, they may do so by contacting their child's school. Parents have the right to ask for and read records about their child unless the district has been legally notified in writing that their rights as a parent have been terminated or otherwise limited by court order. The codes govern the conduct of students, teachers, staff and visitors, and are meant to help maintain safe, orderly schools. As part of the school's program, the school will implement construction standards to prevent run-off, engage in public education and outreach, identify and eliminate unnecessary sources of storm water run-off, and review pollution prevention and good housekeeping practices in the district. The Cohoes City School District hereby advises students, parents, employees and the general public that it offers equal employment and educational opportunities, without regard to sex, race, color, national origin, religion, disability or other minority group. Over a 2-year period, we conducted interviews with BAA parents, students, teachers, administrators, and staff.</paragraph><paragraph parID="421">We spoke with 23 parents, representing 26 students, in individual semi-structured interviews. Questions focused on reasons for choosing BAA, involvement in their children's lives at home and at school, expectations for involvement in their children's education, and changes in their involvement levels over time. In order to present a range of involvement levels, parents were randomly selected from groups according to the number and type of events that they attended. Designations were based on parent attendance levels at four events, two required and two optional, during fall 2002, and membership on BAA's Parent Council Executive Board. BAA hires teachers and staff who are committed to the school's mission and the idea of parents as partners in education. The Community Outreach Coordinator ensures that Boston students and their parents know that the school is an option for them, while the Family Coordinator keeps BAA parents well informed and encourages engagement in the school community. From interviews with parents, we find that both high- and medium-involvement parents participate to a high degree in any events or activities directly related to their own children's school work, such as parent-teacher-student narratives, performances, and exhibitions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="422">Supporting staff commitment to knowing students well and regularly communicating with parents enhance the involvement of teachers, parents, pupils and society in education; information (files and data accessible in the KLASSE Archives, news); discussion (Forum, Guestbook, Feedback); and special services. Home and school are complementary settings in children's development. They each play an important role and continuity is desirable.</paragraph><paragraph parID="423">It is important therefore that parents know what happens at school. Some parents wish a more direct involvement in school. the right information about the different aspects of school; greater involvement; to stimulate contacts among parents; to be involved in discussions about the objectives, organisation and what children will learn at school; and to participate in realising the objectives of the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="424">Parents can participate in classroom activities (mostly in primary education), help raise funds for the school, and become involved in other informal ways. Other opportunities provide a more formal, structured framework of involvement. Research carried out in primary schools in the Netherlands (Smit, 1988: 148) showed that parents' training leads effectively to changes in parents' attitudes to school in their contacts with the teachers, the staff, the participation council and the organising authority. Parents become more aware of the different problems in schools and can be more critical. This was not always appreciated by school staff. The research showed that parents are interested in training because it gives them the chance to gain a better understanding of how the school works and the importance of the statutes and rules of the parent organisations and participation council. Parent training is also highly valued because it enables them to learn from the experiences of other parents, to gain new ideas and to learn how to influence the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="425">Parents' organisations and socio-cultural organisations provide an important role in training parents in Belgium (Flemish Community). The Department of Sociology at Leuven University carried out a small research project to investigate this role. This case study sets out the objectives of parents' organisations, outlines the range of parent training and sets out the methodology and results of the research. Objectives of parent organisations and socio-cultural organisations Parent unions enable parents to organise themselves. In Flanders, there are four organisations. The Flemish Confederation of Local Parent Unions ( VCOV ) is active in Catholic schools (almost all the schools of the subsidised free education network).</paragraph><paragraph parID="426">The Educative Organisation for Parent Work ( EVO ), together with the Council for Parents in Community Education ( ROGO ), is active in Community Schools. The Overall Organisation for Local Parent Unions in the Subsidised Official Education Network ( KOOGO ) is active in City Schools. VCOV has identified four major topics for local parent unions: informing parents about their children's school and helping them in their role as partners in their children's education; involving parents more closely in the decision-making process at school; setting up projects in partnership with the school; and strengthening the links between parents and the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="427">VCOV plays a supporting role by participating in developing the work of parent unions' and serving the interests of parents and their children. ROGO aims to stimulate the participation of parents in school policy whilst EVO specialises in the curricular, pedagogical and cultural aspects of education. KOOGO supports local parent unions by providing parents with training, information, documentation, advice and publications. This training contributes strongly to the effectiveness of local parent unions. Socio-cultural organisations in Flanders, such as the Catholic Union of Rural Women ( KVLV ), the Catholic Women of Labourers ( KAV ) and the Catholic Movement of labourers ( KWB ) also train parents. Their training is focused more on socio-cultural and family-support activities. What is parent training?</paragraph><paragraph parID="428">Vandemeulebroecke (1990: 19-21) distinguishes three strategies for parent training. Parent training can be divided into certain approaches to learning and the most appropriate then identified. [Deficiency-oriented (=) growth-oriented.] The degree of organisation - structured, formal approaches or non-structured, informal approaches. The theoretical framework - parent training can only exist on the basis of the key thought that it is sufficient to provide parents with the right insights and abilities to respond to the realities of education. Parent training within an interpretative framework reacts to this by placing the experiences of parents at the centre so that they come to a better understanding. Emancipative parent training goes one step further by interpreting the experiences of parents by means of critical theories.</paragraph><paragraph parID="429">Research methodology This research project aimed to describe and evaluate the training of parents with children at school in Flanders. The key research questions were as follows. What is the personnel structure of the parent organisations? What kind of parent training is offered? Who decides on the themes for parent training? Do parent organisations work together?</paragraph><paragraph parID="430">How is the offer of parent training evaluated? Research results Since 1996, the Ministry of the Flemish Community, Department of Education has provided an annual subsidy of 13 million Belgian Francs for parents' organisations and socio-cultural organisations. The funding is for operational, project and personnel costs. Groups such as VCOV can also raise funds from membership fees, sales and entrance fees for training events. In addition, the Department of Culture provides funds to enable VCOV and EVO to recruit a further 10 staff and 2 staff respectively. participation in school life; and</paragraph><paragraph parID="431">education of children with special educational needs or learning difficulties. The newsletters may contain reviews of children books, information on planned events such as conferences, or research and information about activities such as holidays and special courses. KWB-KAV publishes particularly technical information about parental participation aimed at parents who are involved in the decision-making processes at school. Some organisations also have their own libraries of literature and audio-visual material. An important task of the parent and socio-cultural organisations is training local parent unions and parent representatives in the participation council/local school council. Collaborators, or trainers visit the unions and give the parent committee (the democratically-chosen board of the local parent union) practical information about the parent organisation's work. The training of parents' representatives includes informing parents about their rights and power in the participation council/local school council.</paragraph><paragraph parID="432">For all parents, there are training evenings and sessions with a special focus on educational and pedagogical issues. This research did not have the resources to evaluate the actual training sessions. Training evenings and sessions are organised in different ways and at different levels. The trainers visit and explain an issue to a local parent union, or organise a training activity at region level. Specialist guest speakers may be invited to regional training activities. The organisations also have volunteers who visit local parent unions to speak about a certain topic. They produce their own training materials.</paragraph><paragraph parID="433">Some local parent unions arrange training activities which help develop their independence. The main parent organisation only provides the materials and advice on methodology. National activities in Flanders seldom take place and are limited to the organisation of conferences or parent parliaments to discuss and exchange information. Headteachers and teachers often attend and help strengthen communications between staff and parents. Popular themes include: next steps in learning and longer-term targets; children and television;</paragraph><paragraph parID="434">Parent training The content - covering very wide domains (e.g. education objectives) or aimed at very specific themes (e.g. parent participation in school policy). All organisations are responsive to frequent telephone calls from parents seeking advice on a wide range of matters. Increasingly, parent training takes the form of projects involving school staff, parents and members of the local community. how parents should approach their children's school; the place of the school in the local community; Parents and teachers may also be trained separately on the same themes, for example: society; technology; language and learning to learn.</paragraph><paragraph parID="435">Co-operation among parents' organisations There are regular contacts among parents' organisations but little collaborative parent training. However, during school year 1998/99, two organisations will collaborate on training parents who have children with special educational needs. Parents have an important voice in the range of the training offered. They can express their preferences in a number of ways, such as through: a parent parliament where parents can give their opinions; and provincial representatives who make the interests of the local parent unions known at provincial meetings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="436">Proposals are submitted to local parent unions, and in consultation with these unions, a national training programme is set up. Two parent organisations established parent working groups to develop the themes for the training activities. This ensures that parents have a role in shaping the national training programme. Evaluation of parent training activities All the organisations find evaluation of parent training important. The results of these evaluations are used to shape future provision. Evaluation methods include:</paragraph><paragraph parID="437">written evaluations such as - parents completing a form after each training activity - parent questionnaires - parent organisations asking for the views of local parent unions across a region - local parent union reports; and - evaluation questions at the end of training - parent organisations telephoning local parent unions for their comments on training</paragraph><paragraph parID="438">Training provided by parent and socio-cultural organisations can be pedagogical as well as educational. Effective participation of parents in schools and in the education of their children can eventually bridge the gap between home and school. Present parent training goes beyond simply the transfer of knowledge and development of skills. Three free magazines are distributed to over a million teachers, parents and pupils every month. It reports on government policies, enhances discussion and contact among all parties involved in education and establishes links with both KLASSE for Parents and KLASSE for Pupils. It was produced after research on parents' reading habits and involvement in education and after thorough discussion with parents' councils, support centres and the relevant school authorities. increase the involvement of parents in education and school life;</paragraph><paragraph parID="439">improve communication among all parties involved in education - teachers, parents, pupils. KLASSE for Parents carefully sets out a balance of themes and topics relating to the family, school and government. It offers parents a platform for discussion, refers them to relevant individuals or organisations and stresses links with both KLASSE for Teachers and KLASSE for Pupils. For more information about the research summarized in this digest, please contact the author at the address below . The research project is a participatory, ethnographic, and ethnolinguistic study of the cultural, social, and educational impact and significance of the Parents Write Their Worlds project, a parent writing and publishing project serving adults in poor and immigrant communities in the area of Chicago, Illinois. Parents Write Their Worlds (PWTW) was created by Hal Adams, founding director of the Community Writing Project (CWP) (College of Education, University of Illinois at Chicago) and myself, and has received funding from local foundations, individual public schools, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. PWTW invites parents into their children's school to participate in personal narrative writing workshops taught by CWP staff, where they meet weekly to write and share stories that draw on their life experience and knowledge.</paragraph><paragraph parID="440">The parent writers then work together in small groups to edit selected stories which are published in the magazine Real Conditions and circulated to the school, community, and beyond. Parent writers are also invited to read their stories at school and community events. PWTW is a program that eschews deficit-based approaches to parent involvement, proposing instead to encourage poor and immigrant parents to participate in the schools as writers (artists), thinkers, and equal partners in their children's education. In this way PWTW aims to broaden and enrich communities of learning in poor and immigrant, urban neighborhoods. The philosophical compatibility among the school, TCEP, PWTW, and the participatory research project, and the extent to which their programs and activities reinforce each other, is a crucial factor to consider when assessing the success and the significance of PWTW. Second, the research examined the significance and impact of PWTW for teachers and students within the school, focusing on the relationship between their use and opinions of the magazine and their changing views of the parent writers, their experiences, and their culture. Finally, the research was concerned with the impact of the writing project on the sociocultural construction of parents and parent involvement, literacy, and immigrant life within the educational community where the writing project took place.</paragraph><paragraph parID="441">The project's participatory research methodology was consistent with both the philosophy of the writing project and ethnographic research, allowing the knowledge, experiences, and values of the parents to inform data collection and analysis at all stages of the research. The participatory research component of the project emerged as TCEP developed and the need for evaluation and research of parent participation became apparent. An evaluation and research committee comprised of parent participants was formed to study existing parent programs and conduct more general research in support of the coalition's initiatives. Evaluation and research committee members, all of whom have also participated in the writing workshop, began by conducting a needs assessment survey of Telpochcalli. The committee then directed their focus toward an ethnographic evaluation of the PWTW project. The integration of ethnography and evaluation allowed the group to develop research questions that were relevant to them as parents and community members while encouraging the use of observational and self-reflective methodologies to explore the cultural and social dimensions of the project's successes and challenges. The research team conducted two surveys aimed at determining response to and interest in the magazine, the writing project, and its impact on readers' views of the writers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="442">The researchers were trained in ethnographic observation and kept journals detailing all activities or conversations related to PWTW or parent involvement more generally. Parent researchers also conducted individual interviews with all parents who have participated in the writing project, as well as with teachers and administrative staff. The method we are using to write the report draws on the workshop method. We begin each session by discussing a particular aspect of the data. At the end of each audiotaped discussion session, participants write reflective summaries of the issues raised. We then read and respond to each other's writing-and to transcribed audiotapes-in the group. Although the writers express increased confidence in their abilities as writers, when posed with the possibility of a joint teacher-parent writing group they were reticent, commenting that they still feel "less than" the teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="443">Apparently even in the context of an innovative community school such as Telpochcalli, the institutions of family and school sustain strong ideologies about gender, knowledge, and social identity against which the writing project continues to do battle. PWTW has a positive impact on the writers' children. At lower levels students read and respond to stories, and have written letters to parent writers about their favorite stories. In the upper grades the magazine has been used as research material for social studies units. The experience PWTW participants have acquired expressing themselves in writing, sharing their ideas with a broader audience, analyzing their life experiences in a group, and having a public presence has contributed to their confidence taking on additional roles in TCEP, sitting on the research-evaluation committee, the outreach committee, the facilities campaign committee, and becoming board members. Participation in the writing project and the research is beginning to cultivate a critical perspective among participants vis-&#224;-vis the norms and expectations of parent involvement as it is currently constructed by the formal educational establishment. For instance, in group discussion after a literacy forum, several mothers concurred with the forum's emphasis on parents spending time engaging in literate activity with their children, but considered it important to privilege Spanish-language literacy so that their children would not forget or lose respect for their family's native language.</paragraph><paragraph parID="444">During another discussion comparing parent involvement programs at several Latino-dominant schools, Telpochcalli mothers distinguished programs at their school as offering parents the opportunity to support the school through their own creative activity, while at other schools parent roles were restricted to supporting teachers in their educational aims. The dynamics of the writing group also change over time. For the first time in the history of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) the law contains a definition of parental involvement. This definition should guide the development and implementation of parental programs in your school and school district, but should not limit additional parental involvement initiatives that may exceed the ESEA definition. The law defines parental involvement as, "the participation of parents in regular, two-way, and meaningful communication involving student academic learning and other school activities including: Assisting their child's learning; Being actively involved in their child's education at school;</paragraph><paragraph parID="445">Serving as full partners in their child's education and being included, as appropriate, in decision-making and on advisory committees to assist in the education of their child; and The carrying out of other activities such as those described in section 1118 of the ESEA Develop a Parent Involvement Policy Develop a School-Parent Compact Building the capacity of families to improve student achievement. Parent Involvement Policies Policy development: First, parents in Title I schools must be involved in developing and approving the school's written parent involvement policy and in planning and reviewing the school's Title I program. To support this involvement, schools must provide opportunities for parents to meet and learn about the program, assistance to attend the meetings, and information that will help parents understand the instructional program and whether it's effective. Annual meeting: At a minimum, schools must hold an annual meeting to describe the program and explain parents' rights to be involved in the program. The meeting should be held at a time and place convenient for parents, and after parents have been given ample notice about the meeting.</paragraph><paragraph parID="446">Planning and review: Parents must be involved in an "organized, ongoing, and timely way" in the planning review and improvement of Title I programs. This includes helping to develop the school's parent involvement policy and program plan. Additional meetings: The school must offer a flexible number of meetings at convenient times, if parents request them, to draw up suggestions and take part in decisions. If needed, transportation, child care or home visits may be provided. The school must respond to suggestions "as soon as practically possible." Reports: The school must provide Title I parents with reports on school performance and their children's assessment results. Information: The school must explain and describe the school's curriculum, assessments used to measure student progress and standards that students are expected to meet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="447">Program plan: If the school has a Title I schoolwide program (a school with more than 40 percent low-income children may opt to serve all students), it must collaborate with families to develop a program plan. The policy also must include: how the policy will be evaluated each year for effectiveness; how the school will identify and address barriers to family participation; and View a Sample Parent Involvement Policy For Parents: PDF Document Building the capacity of families to improve student achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="448">The school's parent involvement policy also must describe how the school will support a partnership between families and staff. (These requirements also apply to the school district's parent involvement policy, too.) Each school and district receiving Title I funds must: Help parents understand the state's academic content and achievement standards, how children will be assessed, and how to monitor children's progress and work with educators to improve their children's achievement. Provide materials and training to help parents improve their children's achievement. Educate teachers, principals and other staff, with help from parents, about the value of parent contributions and about how to reach out, communicate and work with parents as equal partners. Coordinate parent involvement programs with other programs, such as Head Start, Reading First, Even Start and the Parents as Teachers Program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="449">Conduct activities that encourage and support parents to participate more fully in their children's education, such as parent resource centers. Use a format and language that parents can understand to ensure that information related to school and parent programs, meetings, and other activities reaches all parents. Provide reasonable support for other parent involvement activities as parents may request. In addition to the above requirements, the law suggests that districts and schools may take additional measures to strengthen parent involvement. These include: involving parents in developing training for teachers, principals and other educators to improve the effectiveness of such training; providing necessary literacy training (the district should not use Title I funds for this purpose unless it has no other available sources of funding);</paragraph><paragraph parID="450">paying reasonable and necessary expenses for activities to involve parents, including transportation and child care; training parents to engage other parents; arranging school meetings at flexible times, or making home visits with parents who are unable to attend conferences at school; and how families will be involved in planning and reviewing the Title I program to make sure it is working. The school must make this policy available to the local community and to all families in the school "in an understandable and uniform format." That means that it must be in a language families can understand, and that the same information must be contained in each version. Finally, the policy must be updated periodically to meet the changing needs of parents and the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="451">adopting and implementing model approaches to improving parent involvement. As a middle school teacher, I have had numerous parents comment to me that they are loosening up the reigns, so to speak, now that the child is older. This makes it much more difficult to keep organized and track homework. Parents need to maintain or increase their involvement to help their students make a successful transition to the middle school environment. From my experience, students whose parents are involved in school activities and who monitor academic progress are far more successful in school, are more likely to be in honors classes, and participate in more school sponsored activities themselves. In my first year of teaching high school, I had a parent who constantly emailed me about her child's grade and behavior. I even suspected that the parent was completing the child's homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="452">It would be done perfectly, in the child's handwriting, but when test time came around, the child didn't know even the most basic information. On the other hand, I have some parents who don't return phone calls or emails, and just generally don't care about their child's education. This is a very unfortunate situation because that attitude is usually reflected in the student's behavior and attitude as well. Parent involvement is crucial to a student's education, but the key is finding the right mix of involvement. This is not the most scientifically based comment but as a high school teacher I have observed, first hand, the results of parent involvement in their child's education is obvious. There are always those extreme circumstances but for the most part when the parent takes an active role, their child's performance in school is stronger. Those parents who always ask questions of the teacher and schedule the parent-teacher conference have the students who's classroom performance does not warrant any mediation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="453">These are the parents who always come in saying "we just always like to meet our child's teachers." And on the rare occasion when there is a conference with a student who is struggling, the parent ends up admitting that they were not as diligent in supporting their child's education in the past. By no means should the responsibility be removed from the student but it should be a partnership between student, parent, and teacher. I've only been teaching for a few years, but I believe that parental involvement has a profound effect on student achievement. I can say without a doubt that my top students all have parents that are very involved in their child's life and actively make sure their child is doing well in school. A perfect example is when parent-teacher conferences come around the corner. More often than not, I meet with parents of students who are doing well in my class and gives me little to no behavioral problems.</paragraph><paragraph parID="454">The parents that I really need to speak with don't show up or don't respond to my phone calls, messages, emails, etc. Of course, I don't want to overgeneralize the circumstances. Many of my students come from single-parent homes or have a lower socioeconomic status, which means their parents/guardians are working day and night to provide for their families. Even if they want to be more involved and active in their child's life, they simply don't have the time. In those cases, it really is up to the teachers to make an extra effort to contact the parents, develop a relationship with them, and keep an extra eye out for those particular students. It's impossible to do this for every student who's in this kind of situation, but it certainly doesn't hurt to try. As a high school teacher, I have found that a teacher's role is vital in Parent Involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="455">As students reach adolescence, they are much less likely to sit with their parents on the couch and talk about their day. They often don't have any interest in talking to their parents at all with can make it difficult for parents to stay involved. I think some parents do a fantastic job of staying informed, however as teachers we should do all we can to build a support system for students. If parents and teachers are on the same page it is easier to keep the student there too. I have kept a teacher website in the past, and it was beneficial but I found I couldn't seem to keep it as up to date as I would've liked. This year I have a Moodle page for each of my classes with serves many purposes. Students can collaborate with their peers and submit work, as well as find the files of handouts or homework that they might need.</paragraph><paragraph parID="456">Parents can then actually see their students work in comparison to other students as well as all the assignments and notes we have gone over in class. I spend so much less time answering the same question from parents, it's wonderful! Parent involvement is definitely a two way street. This is a case where too much parent involvement can get in the way of the academic development of the student. Parent involvement in education is a very broad term. Research shows that when parents are involved in their child's education, students have improved attendence, motivation, and academic achievement. (National Conference of State Legislatures).</paragraph><paragraph parID="457">According to a Newsweek--PTA poll, nearly 40 percent of our country's parents say that they do not feel that they spend enough time on their child's education (US Dept. of Education). Parental involvement may come in many forms, from reading to your child and helping with homework, visiting and volunteering at schools, and participating in parent/school groups. Applications in School Visit or volunteer at your child's school if your schedule allows. This will let your child know that you think that education is important and interesting. Know your child's surroundings. The more you know about your child's school, teachers, classmates..., the better equipped you will be to help your child handle difficult situations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="458">Be involved in parent organizations. There are many different forms of parent organizations available. Find out what kinds of different organizations are available. Parent-Teacher Clubs - Many schools have parent-teacher clubs. Citizen's Advisory Council- This is a committee of community members that review school policies and make suggestions to the school administrators and school boards. School Board - Get to know your school board members. Eduation Advancement Foundations - These organizations offer the availability of additional educational funding.</paragraph><paragraph parID="459">Sports Booster Clubs - Extracurricular activities offer students an ability to excel in areas other than academics. These activities are good for body and soul. Support the athletic teams as a supporter and as a fan. Research shows that the most effective parent involvment in education comes through parents working with their children at home (Cotton). Below are some ideas for parents: Develop a homework schedule. Set aside a specific time and place each day for your child to work on homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="460">Try to make this a quiet place, free of TV, radio, and telephones. Review your child's homework with them. This will increase the student's accountability for completing the homework. It also allows the parent and child time to connect. Offer encouragement and be available to answer questions when they struggle. Read Together. Research shows that achievement improves when parents and children read together.</paragraph><paragraph parID="461">Also have siblings read together. Keep the lines of communication open. Parent involvement seems to decrease as students reach the difficult teenage years. Stay involved in your child's education during these years. Know what is going on. Talk with other parents. Check out your school's webpage (if they have one).</paragraph><paragraph parID="462">Encourage your teenager to talk to you about how school is going. Talk to your teenager about values and responsibility. Parental Involvement at the Middle and High School Levels Parental involvement in education decreases significantly at after students reach middle school. Reasons for this may include the curriculum becoming more difficult so parents are less likely to be able to help students, both parents being employed now that the child is older, and children become more independent. Children begin to change in social, mental, and physical states, so the parents need to show their support in the child's life even if it seems that it is not wanted. The parental role in the older child's education may include:</paragraph><paragraph parID="463">Monitoring Homework -This is essential! A lot of students will come home and say that they have already completed their homework, when in most cases the homework hasn't even made it home with the student. Monitoring homework can be as simple as checking the assignment and making sure that it is completed or as detailed as spending some time having their child explain or justify their answers showing that they do or do not understand what they are learning. Making college plans - Parent can show an interest in the child's education by discussing college plans and helping choose appropriate high school coursework. Parent - School Communication - Parents and schools should communicate about achievement and behavioral issues. Parental Involvement: The Teacher's Role In the upper levels students may have five to nine different teachers each year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="464">When each teacher has a different preference and approach to parental involvement it can be a confusing and uncertain situation for parents. Of course parents should ask their children about homework and have an idea if students are succeeding or struggling. These days middle and high schools often discourage parents of students without academic or social problems from attending parent teacher conferences. Teacher contact with parents should not occur only when problems arise. However, with five classes of 25 students each, it is unrealistic for middle and high school teachers to have regular, individual, positive contact with parents. Teacher Website -Every teacher should have a website with at least basic contact information and the type of information given out at "Back to School" nights at the beginning of the year such as grading policies and class behavior expectations. Many text series include "Letters to Parents" for each unit or chapter that can be used for ideas or appended to a newsletter.</paragraph><paragraph parID="465">Common classroom issues can be addressed in a non-threatening, non-embarrassing manner in newsletters. Middle school teachers must regularly and discreetly discuss hygiene issues with students. This is just one example of a non-academic topic that can be included in a newsletter. Perhaps a museum exhibit or art gallery or performance could enhance a student's understanding and promote discussion within the family. Parental Involvement in Governance (Cotton) This area of parental involvement is controversial. Some parents feel that they should play a more active part in making decisions about school policies, budget issues, choosing textbooks and teaching materials, and personnel decisions such as hiring teachers and administrators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="466">(Cotton) School administrators, teachers, and school board members are trained in these areas whereas parents are not. The Public Agenda study shows that many parents are not qualified to make these decisions about their child's school and most teachers are also not in favor of allowing parents to make these types of decisions (National Conference of State Legislatures). There comes a point when students need to begin to take responsibility for their own decisions and education. As a high school teacher, we have begun to see a disturbing trend where students do not step up and take responsibility for their actions. Instead, these students rely on their parents to "fight their battles" for them. Students need to begin to take on these responsibilities prior to entering college. This does not mean that parents should not be involved in their children's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="467">Parents should frequently ask about school, make sure that they see grade reports, and encourage a good homework routine. At the high school level, I feel that when there is an issue with grades or behavior, parents should help to teach the child how to deal with the situation themselves; give them tips on how to discuss the issues with teachers in order to better prepare them for college and adult life. Signed "Life Experiences", Testimonies and Stories In my classroom I have seen students where there parents are unable to spend much time with them for various reasons. After seeing these students struggle, some one-on-one support was given to them. It was amazing what some "well spent time" could do for the children. I strongly believe that parent involvement with their children in their learning is needed, even if it is as little as reading a book to them before they go to bed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="468">Attend parent-teacher conferences. With children becoming more independent, parents need to be even more involved because this is where so many children need them the most. All schools are different, indeed, all teachers are different with regards to the amount of parental involvement they encourage. A more helpful website will include basic curriculum information such as topics covered each quarter. Newsletter -Teachers may find this to be a chore but parents are always grateful to get some idea about what is happening in the classroom. Even everyday events can support curricular topics: figuring the tip on meal, reading an article in the daily newspaper, watching the news with kids, making meals and following recipes, playing cards or board games. Parent involvement has been repeatedly identified as a protective factor for young, low-income children's positive development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="469">Epstein and her colleagues (1996) have proposed a framework of parent involvement that includes six main types of activities that connect families, schools, and communities. While numerous studies have used Epstein's framework to examine relationships between components of parent involvement and important child outcomes, they have yielded inconsistent results. These mixed findings are most likely explained by research designs that discount the richness of parent involvement by using single or small sets of survey items to measure this multidimensional construct. In addition, parent involvement research has tended to focus on heterogeneous groups of children, hindering our understanding of the differential efficacy of involvement activities across different stages of development and for culturally diverse groups of children. A recent study by Fantuzzo and colleagues identified a multidimensional construct of parent involvement with a preschool Head Start sample (Fantuzzo, Tighe, McWayne, Davis, &amp; Childs, 2002). The Parent Involvement in Children's Education Scale (PICES) is a 40-item parent report instrument that provides information on the frequency of specific involvement behaviors across three dimensions: Supportive home learning environment - parent behaviors that promote learning at home, such as spending time with children talking about school activities</paragraph><paragraph parID="470">Direct school contact - parents' direct involvement in school-based activities and direct communications with school personnel Inhibited involvement - barriers to parents' involvement in their children's education, such as time constraints The purpose of this study was to identify a multidimensional picture of parent involvement in kindergarten, and to determine whether parent involvement dimensions in an ethnic minority, low-income kindergarten sample are congruent with those identified in a demographically similar preschool sample. Research Methods Three hundred seven ethnic minority kindergarten children and their caregivers recruited from seven urban public schools in the Northeast participated in this study. Of these families, 95% were African American, 4% were Asian American, and 1% identified as Latino or "other." Boys and girls were represented equally, all came from low-income families, and most had attended preschool (72%), specifically Head Start (61%).</paragraph><paragraph parID="471">A number of teacher and parent measures were used in order to examine parent involvement and kindergarten children's social and academic competencies. Parents reported on their involvement using the Parent Involvement in Children's Education Scale (PICES) (Fantuzzo et al., 2002), as well as on their children's peer play competencies (PIPPS) (Fantuzzo &amp; Hampton, 2000) and broader social skills and problems (SSRS) (Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990). Teachers also reported on children's social skills and problem behaviors, peer play competencies, and academic success (Academic Subscale of the teacher SSRS). Two sets of analyses were conducted: (1) an assessment of the generalization of PICES dimensions across a kindergarten sample, and (2) an investigation of the relationships between family involvement (PICES) dimensions and kindergarten children's outcomes. Through our analyses, we identified reliable dimensions of family involvement for this kindergarten sample identical to those found with a demographically similar population of Head Start preschool children: supportive home learning environment, direct school contact, and inhibited involvement. Additional analyses indicated that these three dimensions related significantly to children's academic and social functioning at both home and school. Findings highlighted two distinct patterns of parent involvement for families of kindergarten children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="472">First, involved parents were characterized as providing a rich learning environment at home with activities, including talking with their child about the importance of school and helping them practice what they are learning in school. Children of these involved parents evidenced high levels of social skills and were observed to be more cooperative, self-controlled, and prosocially engaged in both home and school environments. Additionally, the academic functioning of children with more involved parents was rated as higher than the functioning of children with less involved parents, as evidenced by greater academic motivation as well as achievement in reading and mathematics. A second pattern of relationships emerged from this study with parents who reported being "disconnected" from the educational learning experiences of their child. Specifically, low levels of direct school contact and increased inhibited involvement were related to children's externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors in school. These parents reported more barriers, such as increased familial stress and work responsibilities, that often precluded their involvement. In summary, results using this multidimensional assessment tool suggest that parents who actively promote learning in the home, have direct and regular contact with school, and experience fewer barriers to involvement have children who demonstrate positive engagement with their peers, adults, and learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="473">Implications for Practice Findings from this study have several implications for early childhood educators and programs. Family involvement has become a greater challenge in recent years as the characteristics of families are changing. Now more than ever, mothers constitute a significant portion of the workforce, and many low-income children are living in single, female-headed households (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). This supports the call for a modification of traditional parent involvement activities that are largely school-based (such as volunteering in the classroom) to accommodate working mothers or those without childcare. In addition, ethnic and cultural diversity among low-income families is increasing (National Center for Children in Poverty, 2002). Demographic changes, and the discontinuity that often exists between home and school environments for young, minority low-income children, underscore the need for culturally sensitive methods for understanding and encouraging parental involvement (Slaughter-Defoe &amp; Brown, 1998).</paragraph><paragraph parID="474">More partnership is needed between schools and families in order to find a common ground and a common language in which to discuss involvement strategies. It will be important to assess the expectations of educators and determine if those expectations are realistic given the familial and cultural context. Efforts that are not in the scope of possibility for parents experiencing multiple stressors will create further disconnection between home and school and have a disempowering effect on parents' ability to be involved in their children's education. In addition, information is needed regarding the successful strategies that culturally diverse, low-income parents are already employing that go unrecognized by early childhood staff, because they occur largely at home or because of personal biases that teachers may have toward particular cultural groups. The significant impact of home-based involvement on child outcomes in this study highlights the need to stimulate educational involvement and support at home. We need creative solutions for engaging parents in their children's learning. For example, future intervention efforts may look to focus on the content of home-based learning activities and search for more effective and efficient ways for parents to spend time with their children in the home context.</paragraph><paragraph parID="475">Schools and communities can also help create extracurricular activities that are known to support and enhance children's motivation and interest in school and be more accessible for parents with hectic lives (Gutman &amp; McLoyd, 2000). Schools and families need to co-construct a workable operationalization of "involvement." Given the protective potential of parent involvement, it is a task worthy of our commitment. ACTION OPTIONS: Educators, with input from families and community members, can take the following steps to build strong partnerships: Convene an action team comprising parents and family members, teachers and other school staff, administrators, community members, and students to brainstorm ideas for family and community involvement, implement programs, and determine the next steps for improvement. Develop a needs assessment to determine the needs of the school, students, and families. The needs assessment can take the form of a questionnaire or parent involvement inventory to survey staff and families regarding the school's current promotion of family and community involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="476">Adopt a family involvement policy stating the school's willingness and desire to work in partnership with parents, families, and the community. Work with parents, families, teachers, and community members to develop a learning compact . Make a point to introduce school policies and programs to families at the beginning of the school year. This is the key time to provide families with welcome letters, information packets, school calendars, and home-school handbooks. Be aware that language can be inclusive or exclusive. When addressing letters sent home, use "Dear Parents and Caregivers" to include the families of children being raised in nontraditional family settings. Develop personal contact with parents and families through parent-teacher conferences, home visiting, and parent liaisons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="477">Create a parent center , or place in the school that parents and families can call their own. Equip it with comfortable furniture, a phone, a coffeepot, and resource materials. Provide opportunities for families and the community to visit the school. Open houses, classroom observations, class parties, and school social activities are welcoming occasions. Help parents and caregivers understand their roles in building a strong parent/school relationship , such as getting to know a child's teacher, asking questions, spending time in school activities, and monitoring homework. Use special programs and practices to involve families at the school. These strategies might include informal school-family gatherings, workshops, programs to promote family involvement at the secondary school, and strategies for involving families of children with special needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="478">Encourage parents and community members to share their skills and experiences with students as part of classroom activities. Develop a program to provide information to parents and caregivers whose first language is not English. Make sure that the program involves staff members and school volunteers from diverse backgrounds so that families feel comfortable asking questions or reaching out to a contact person. Use cassette tapes to convey school information to parents and caregivers who have low literacy skills. Make the school building available to parents and community residents for educational, recreational, and social activities. Schools often are centrally located and considered neutral territory. As residents begin to use the school for adult education classes, summer concert programs, holiday parties, and community resource fairs, they can learn about the educational program and are likely to become advocates for the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="479">IMPLEMENTATION PITFALLS: Teachers may view working with parents and community members as an addition to their already long list of responsibilities. School districts or state departments of education often mandate teachers to work with parent or advisory groups but fail to provide the needed time for learning and developing leadership skills, communication proficiencies, and facilitation competencies. Teacher education at the undergraduate level typically provides little training in parent involvement. (Refer to the Critical Issue " Finding Time for Professional Development .") Inconvenient hours, inaccessible personnel, communication that uses educational jargon, and unwelcoming visiting procedures all can be barriers to parent and family involvement. To assess the situation, schools can survey parents' opinions through a questionnaire . Together, schools can work with parents and families to develop strategies for overcoming barriers to parent involvement .</paragraph><paragraph parID="480">Sometimes a school will adopt a new family-involvement program and overlook the many ways parents and families presently are participating in the school. An inventory of current efforts by parents within the school should be done before new programs are undertaken. Members of existing parent groups--such as PTA, PTO, or Booster Club--should be invited to work with school personnel in defining new family-involvement efforts. Every school has several activist parents. It becomes easy to call on them whenever a parent representative is needed. Special efforts need to be made to broaden the list of parents who represent the school, perhaps using more active parents to recruit others. Although parent and community members do not expect to get paid a salary, they rarely stay involved if their efforts are not appreciated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="481">A successful volunteer program "pays" participants by providing them with new skills and knowledge and finding ways to show appreciation to volunteers . The task of establishing and overseeing an effective family and community involvement program is too large to be an add-on to anyone's staff assignment. The strongest programs rely on a parent liaison or parent-involvement coordinator who networks with families and the community, plans programs, assists teachers, and develops materials. When the school building is shared by a number of organizations in the community, several issues arise. A plan must be developed for coordinating activities, providing additional maintenance services, and establishing procedures for the use of materials and equipment. DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW: Some educators believe that schools have neither the time nor the resources to establish partnerships with families and community members. When additional responsibilities are added, the school's ability to offer first-rate curriculum and teaching is diluted.</paragraph><paragraph parID="482">Further, they note that teachers and other school personnel are not prepared to address the social and emotional well-being of children, to reach out to parents and community members, or to provide services to adults; adding these concerns will stress the already thin resources available to schools. They point out that other institutions in the community are charged with providing services to adults and should be encouraged to do so. Other educators think that if schools begin to give parents a greater say about their children's education, parents will think they have the expertise to make decisions regarding curriculum or the choice of textbooks. These educators do not want parents to challenge the school's professional autonomy and judgment. They believe it is best to keep a healthy distance between parents and the school lest the parents attempt to run the school. Some parents prefer the domains of school and home to be discrete. They believe that they are perfectly capable of carrying out their parental responsibilities without the interference of institutions such as schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="483">They may find the school's overtures of help to be an intrusion rather than assistance. When a school begins providing health services, offering recreational programs, and promoting certain parenting practices, these parents may believe the school is usurping their role as parents. In some cases, however, such activities may encourage the parent to allow the school to assume responsibilities formerly held by the parent. Community School District #3, New York, New York , emphasizes family and community involvement through parent/child learning activities, parent education, family advocacy and decision making, and connections to cultural organizations and social service agencies. Hueco Elementary School, El Paso, Texas , which serves low-income families on the rural outskirts of town, developed a parent volunteer program and encourages families to participate in school improvement efforts. It also offers programs for families such as parenting classes, a community health-education program, citizenship class, English as a second language, and computer classes. Offer programs that provide useful skills or personal enrichment activities to involve parents and caregivers who previously had negative personal experiences at school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="484">If a family involvement program is to succeed, the school must provide professional development activities. The school culture may marginalize the role of parents and families and create an environment that discourages participation. They say that providing an instructional program that will prepare young people to be effective citizens in the 21st century is more than a full-time job for schools. Critical Issue: Constructing School Partnerships with Families and Community Groups ISSUE: Educators sometimes are content to let parents and families take the initiative in becoming involved in their children's education. But for a real partnership to occur, educators must look at ways in which the school can initiate this involvement. In such a partnership, the school and the home share responsibility for children's learning; the relationship is based on mutual respect and acknowledgment of the assets and expertise of each member.</paragraph><paragraph parID="485">As an extension of this partnership, schools can emphasize a broad base of community involvement . When schools develop and implement strategies for promoting effective school-family-community partnerships , the result is improved learning for all students and strengthened schools, families, and communities. OVERVIEW: Research indicates that family involvement in schools increases student achievement (Henderson &amp;amp; Berla, 1994; Ballen &amp;amp; Moles, 1994; Epstein, 1995). The benefits of parent and family involvement include higher test scores and grades, better attendance, more completion of homework, more positive attitudes and behavior, higher graduation rates, and greater enrollment in higher education. A literature review of school-family partnerships indicates that benefits are apparent not only for younger children but all students through high school. Although parent involvement typically is strongest at the primary level, continued involvement through the middle grades and at the secondary school level is important in encouraging and guiding children's development and achievement. When schools regard their relationship with families as a partnership in which school and home share responsibility for children's learning, the result is an increase in the levels and types of parent involvement as well as the support that families demonstrate for the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="486">When this partnership is extended to include the larger community, the benefits are greater yet. Perhaps most important is that when responsibility for children's learning is shared by the school, home, and community, children have more opportunities for meaningful, engaged learning . Students are able to see the connection between the curriculum in the school and the skills that are required in the real world. A partnership approach gives families and community members greater opportunities to determine options for school involvement, to participate in the wide range of involvement activities, and to assume key roles and responsibilities in school-improvement efforts, including participation in the school's decision-making processes. If a partnership is to succeed, it must be based on "mutual trust and respect, an ongoing exchange of information, agreement on goals and strategies, and a sharing of rights and responsibilities" (Ballen &amp; Moles, 1994). Schools must be willing to involve parents, families, and the community at deeper levels and to support their participation. Support for family and community involvement begins with school administrators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="487">Their willingness to recruit parents and community members for school tasks, to listen to other people's viewpoints, and to share decision making provides a necessary foundation for all school-family-community partnerships. Williams and Chavkin (1989) note that administrative support can be provided through funding that is made available from the district office budget; materials, space, and equipment used in promoting family and community involvement; and people designated to carry out programs. School administrators are instrumental in providing teachers with professional development in family and community involvement. Such professional development is a critical part of effective partnerships. All school staff need to develop the necessary skills for working effectively with parents and families . Typically, very little preservice time is devoted to preparing teachers in family involvement . The school district or system can take the lead in offering teachers professional development on collaborating with parents and families, learning about family dynamics and nontraditional family structures, improving two-way communication between school and home, reducing barriers to family involvement, and understanding diverse cultures (Ballen &amp;amp; Moles, 1994).</paragraph><paragraph parID="488">Administrators also can encourage other approaches to help the school expand its ability to work with families. One activity is for parents or community volunteers to help teachers and other school staff develop an awareness of the school families and the community in which the school is located. "Parents in some schools, for example, take teachers on Community Walks that introduce teachers to the local neighborhood and help them understand the lives of their students outside of school," note Funkhouser and Gonzales (1997). Another activity is involving school staff in action research . In this approach, teams of teachers meet monthly in small groups to study school-family-community relationships, discuss efforts to involve families and the community, and devise strategies to improve their own practice (Davies, 1991). After the groundwork has been laid with school staff, schools can begin to establish school-family-community partnerships through the creation of an action team that is committed to developing a comprehensive family-involvement program. This team is a collaboration of teachers and other school staff, administrators, students, parents, and community members.</paragraph><paragraph parID="489">Members of the team bring their own perspectives, experiences, and skills to the project. They are responsible for the following tasks: conducting a needs assessment, developing goal statements, identifying strategies to meet the goals, developing implementation plans, and using evaluation tools. A needs assessment is a vehicle used to determine the needs and current level of satisfaction of school staff and families regarding the school's family-involvement opportunities. It also asks all respondents to describe additional programs and practices that would be of value to them. A needs assessment typically takes the form of a survey, which can be a simple questionnaire asking parents' opinions on the school's current involvement practices and how welcome they feel in the school, or a more detailed parent involvement inventory asking for feedback from school staff as well as parents. The use of telephone interviews and school meetings also can ensure that a greater percentage of families will provide their input into the process. Goals and policies for school-family-community partnerships then can be developed based on real needs and strengths, not perceived ones, increasing the chances for a successful program built on what is already working.</paragraph><paragraph parID="490">After analyzing the results of the needs assessment, the action team can develop goals for the school's involvement program. Agreement on a few basic goals can lead to the development of a family involvement policy . The assessed needs of the school, families, and the community help the team to determine what a policy should include . A family involvement policy generally reflects the school's commitment to a partnership approach and to ongoing communication between the school, families, and the community. It also can establish guidelines for the types and levels of involvement programs that the school will support. In addition, this involvement policy can clarify the school's priorities in generating an outreach approach to all families, developing parent education and support programs, providing professional development programs for school staff, and creating formal partnerships with agencies and businesses in the community. Some school-family-community partnerships also develop a learning compact , a written commitment that defines the goals, expectations, and responsibilities of schools, parents, families, and the community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="491">A learning compact ensures that all stakeholders share responsibility for the education of children. The next task of the action team is selecting the types of involvement programs that will help the school reach its goals. Specific programs and activities should reflect the partnership approach. Successful family-community involvement can take many forms--helping children at home, volunteering in the classroom, participating in decision making at the school, serving on school boards and committees, and promoting bond issues in the community. Deciding on the partnership programs or activities that best suit each school or district is determined by the situation in the school community; there is no specific program that will work for all schools. "Effective strategies for partnerships differ from community to community, and the most appropriate strategies for a particular community will depend on local interests, needs, and resources," note Funkhouser and Gonzales (1997). To help educators develop programs that promote family and community partnerships, the National Network of Partnership Schools (1997) describes Joyce Epstein's framework of six types of involvement :</paragraph><paragraph parID="492">Parenting: Assisting families with parenting and child-rearing skills, and assisting schools in understanding their families. Communicating: Developing effective communication from home-to-school and school-to-home. Volunteering: Creating ways that families can be involved in the school or school programs and effective methods of recruitment. Learning at home: Linking families with their children's curriculum through learning activities that can be done at home, as well as homework. Decision making: Including families as decision makers, advocates, members of school councils, and committees. Collaborating with the community: Coordinating services in the community with family needs, and providing services to the community. After selecting the types of involvement and specific strategies necessary to meet the identified goals, the action team then develops implementation plans for each of the selected practices.</paragraph><paragraph parID="493">When developing an involvement program , the team considers many important factors, such as assigning responsibilities, preparing budgets, and delineating a timeline. The National Network of Partnership Schools (1997) has identified sample practices , expected challenges and redefinitions , and anticipated results when implementing each of the six types of involvement. Communication is an important part of any involvement program. The action team needs to develop strategies to ensure that two-way communication occurs on a regular basis between school and home and between school and community. "If families are to be involved as true partners in their children's education, it is important to provide ongoing opportunities to hear their concerns and comments as well as providing them information," notes Moles (1996). Strategies for personal contact can include home visiting, establishment of a parent center and a parent liaison to coordinate involvement efforts, telephone communication, and parent-teacher conferences. Strategies for written communication can include introductory and year-end letters to parents and students, parent-teacher contract letters, notes for keeping in touch, and classroom newsletters.</paragraph><paragraph parID="494">When schools serve familes who are from a diversity of cultures or who have limited English-speaking skills, special consideration must be given to communication; a good beginning is to provide information on school policies and programs in materials that are jargon-free and written in the preferred language of the families. When schools serve families who have low literacy skills, teachers may wish to use cassette tapes instead of written material to communicate with parents and caregivers. By making this type of commitment, the members of the action team--who represent the school, the parents, and the community--emphasize that they regard learning as a shared responsibility. Volunteers should be valued for their efforts in whatever capacity they are able to participate. Even minor participation can be the basis for greater involvement later (Eastman, 1988). To encourage their participation, schools can create positive experiences so parents realize that school is a place where they are welcomed and able to acquire needed skills. (Refer to the Critical Issue " Creating the School Climate and Structures to Support Parent and Family Involvement .")</paragraph><paragraph parID="495">Collaborating with the community leads to the development of partnerships with selected community organizations and agencies. These partnerships promote the sharing of information and resources that are helpful to students and families. Community groups, cultural organizations, volunteer organizations, businesses, senior groups, and religious organizations can provide cultural, recreational, and extracurricular opportunities so that children's lives are enriched. A broad base of community involvement contributes to awareness and support for the activities and learning taking place in the school. Community partnerships also can help schools address family concerns. Because growing numbers of children come from households in which all the adults are employed outside the home, families may be looking to schools for assistance with child-care needs. Community organizations can provide child care, after-school programs, assistance with homework, and parenting education programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="496">Often the living conditions of families are so severe that they must be addressed before parents have the time or energy to devote to school concerns. Partnerships with community agencies can make health and social services, such as medical care and counseling, available to students and families through the school. (Refer to the Critical Issue " Restructuring Schools to Support School-Linked Services .") The success of the action team's efforts to develop family-involvement strategies is a barometer of whether the school climate welcomes parent participation in other decision-making roles . For example, the school can encourage families and community members to participate in decision-making activities through representation on various committees or local school councils. Funkhouser and Gonzalez (1997) note that families and community members can "share ideas and help make decisions on school policies related to the budget, teacher and principal hiring, schoolwide plans, and parent involvement activities." Parent and community involvement in school-based governance makes the school more accountable to the community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="497">Shields (1994) notes the importance of including families and the community in school reform efforts: "This vision of school improvement compels us to create a new conception of the appropriate relationship between the school and its community, parents, and families. Pedagogically, as we have come to know the importance of rooting learning in children's real lives, we can no longer tolerate the artificial boundaries between the classroom and the home. Politically, as we move the authority for decision making down to those closest to children, we cannot afford to exclude parents and community members from the process of crafting new schools. Nor can we avoid being held more directly accountable to the immediate community constituency for decisions made at the school site. Practically, schools have no chance of enacting the fundamental changes on the reform agenda in the absence of whole-hearted support from the entire community--parents, citizens, and business." Finally, it is imperative to evaluate strategies to determine if the desired results are being achieved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="498">The original goals of the involvement program should be used to establish indicators of success, and these indicators can be developed for every aspect of the program. The evaluation process should be continuous throughout the program, not only at the end of the school year. By evaluating progress on a constant basis, ineffective strategies can be changed to better address evolving needs. Goals and objectives can be refined if assumptions made at the beginning of the program are no longer true. By taking a collaborative approach to the development of a family-involvement program, schools can form successful partnerships with families and community groups to improve the educational achievement of all students. The synergy resulting from such partnerships creates greater benefits than each group working individually. "With frequent interactions between school, families, and communities," notes Epstein (1995), "more students are more likely to receive common messages from various people about the importance of school, of working hard, of thinking creatively, of helping one another, and of staying in school" (p. 702).</paragraph><paragraph parID="499">As a result, school-family-community partnerships enable students and families to produce their own successes. GOALS: Schools work with families and the community to define a wide array of ways in which families and community members can be involved in the school. Educators identify activities that are mutually meaningful and valuable to the school, students, parents, families, and community members. School personnel receive professional development in the areas of communicating with parents and caregivers, assessing family needs, and serving as members of planning groups. Students benefit from the partnership of school, family, and community through improved achievement, more positive attitudes and behavior, improved self-esteem, and better attendance. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT?</paragraph><paragraph parID="500">There are many advantages when parents play an active role in the educational process. Children spend much more time at home than at school. Their parents know them intimately, interact with them one-to-one, and do not expect to be paid to help their children succeed. The home environment, more familiar and less structured than the classroom, offers what Dorothy Rich (1985) calls "'teachable moments' that teachers can only dream about." Children whose parents are involved in their formal education have many advantages. They have better grades, test scores, long-term academic achievement, attitudes, and behavior than those with disinterested mothers and fathers (Anne T. Henderson 1988). Many studies underscore the point: parent participation in education is very closely related to student achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="501">A Stanford study found that using parents as tutors brought significant and immediate changes in children's I.Q. scores. The Home and School Institute concluded that parent tutoring brought substantial improvements to a wide variety of students (Rich). Family and school benefit when they cooperate. Tutoring is probably the best way for parents to participate in public education, according to Rich. Intensive, one-to-one teaching is highly effective, and, unlike meetings, it does not take parents away from their children and their home. Tutoring can be as simple as reading a book or discussing a television show. It may entail meeting with a teacher to determine how to help with homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="502">Or it can mean mastering a detailed curriculum written by specialists in home learning. Parents' attitudes and expectations toward education can be as important as explicit teaching activities. The American Association of School Administrators (1988) suggests the following "curriculum of the home": high expectations, an emphasis on achievement, role modeling the work ethic, encouraging and providing a place for study, establishing and practicing structured routines, monitoring television, limiting afterschool jobs, and discussing school events. WHAT ARE THE SPECIAL CHALLENGES FOR INVOLVING THE PARENTS OF AT-RISK CHILDREN? Educators of at-risk children must realize that the term "at risk" is not synonymous with minority student, student in poverty, or student in single-parent or restructured household. Yet, as Carol Ascher (1987) points out, some family characteristics tend to inhibit academic achievement: households in which the parent or parents do not interact often with their children, ones whose composition frequently changes, non-English speaking households, and families whose cultural traditions sharply vary from the school's. Educators must take the initiative if they wish to overcome such challenges.</paragraph><paragraph parID="503">Briggs Middle School in Springfield, Oregon, hired a parent educator and a therapist to work directly with parents of at-risk children (Thomas E. Hart 1988). They contacted seventy-five parents, ten of whom completed the five-class program. A program developed by the Center for Research on Elementary and Middle Schools (1989) enables teachers to involve parents in their children's education in math, science, and social studies. The TIPS (Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork) program consists of guidelines and materials that any school or district can adapt to its own curriculum objectives and texts. Middle College High School of New York City offers a parent support group in which parents define the topics discussed: parent-child communication, financial aid, and teenage lifestyles, for example (Douglas Berman and others 1987). Their children's attendance, grades, and behavior improved noticeably. Ascher points out that asking parents to come to school "shuts out parents who are afraid or unable" to do so, the very parents who may well need the most help in educating their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="504">Home visits, telephone calls, and meetings in neutral locations may be the key to working with these parents. HOW CAN SCHOOLS GET PARENTS INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION? Some parents are too distrustful of schools to help them educate their children. Muriel Hamilton-Lee (1988) prescribes three solutions: get parents involved in special activities like P.T.A. and school outings, enlist them in regular school affairs as assistant teachers or library aides, and incorporate them on planning and management teams. "Having parents interact with school professionals as colleagues and peers," she concludes, "does a great deal to reduce the barriers between them." Empathy is critical in any program for disadvantaged parents. Yet many parents who will not volunteer in the schools or are unavailable during school hours will take time to help their children learn, particularly if they can do so at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="505">There are specific programs for such parents, such as Reading Is Fundamental and Family Math, which starts with parent-child workshops. Other districts devise their own home-study curricula, often consisting of one weekly activity. The TIPS program calls for parents to help their children with math and science homework and to make presentations in social studies classrooms. Most parents require some sort of training before using such curricula. Less formal programs are more easily implemented. Teacher-parent conferences are ideal opportunities for suggesting and explaining simple home study activities. Teachers can follow up such conversations by sending home notes and photocopied materials.</paragraph><paragraph parID="506">HOW CAN PARENT-INVOLVEMENT PROGRAMS BE IMPLEMENTED ON A DISTRICTWIDE BASIS? Innovative and energetic teachers find ways to involve parents in education. Capable administrators can do that on a larger scale. Implementation begins by making certain that all staff members understand the subject's importance. Simply asking or requiring teachers to schedule some of their parent conferences in the evening can make a big difference. Some districts use more sophisticated media. The contract, which is also signed by the student and teacher, commits the parent to talking about school daily, attending teacher-parent conferences, monitoring television viewing, and encouraging good study habits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="507">The district holds a signing day at the beginning of each year. Mothers and fathers hold bake sales, supervise field trips, and serve on boards or advisory councils for schools. They attend school concerts, plays, and sporting events. As helpful as these customary forms of parent involvement are, they are far removed from what happens in the classroom. A growing body of research suggests that parents can play a larger role in their children's education. Other research projects found that community involvement correlated strongly with schoolwide achievement and that all forms of parent involvement helped student achievement. Children feel that these two institutions--by far the most important in their lives--overlap and are integrated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="508">Parents who help their children succeed academically gain a sense of pride in their children and themselves. Some districts hire a parent-school coordinator to work with faculty and parents to integrate school and home learning. Administrators can also alert parents to home education's advantages. The Indianapolis Public Schools, for example, widely publicizes its teacher-parent conferences to encourage participation (National School Boards Association 1988).

District Wide Family Involvement Policy</paragraph><paragraph parID="516">PART I.          GENERAL EXPECTATIONS The Lee County School Board recognizes that the education of each student is a responsibility shared by the school and the students' families and promotes partnerships that will build family involvement capacity and participation in promoting academic, social, emotional and physical growth of all our children. The Lee County School Board will integrate this family component into the school division plan for achieving high standards for all students as mandated in the parental involvement goals of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. The Lee County School Board agrees to implement the following statutory requirements:  The school district will put into operation programs, activities and procedures for the involvement of parents in all of its schools with Title I, Part A programs, consistent with section 1118 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Those programs, activities and procedures will be planned and operated with meaningful consultation with parents of participating children. Consistent with section 1118, the school district will work with its schools to ensure that the required school-level parental involvement policies meet the requirements of section 1118(b) of the ESEA, and each include, as a component, a school-parent compact consistent with section 1118(d) of the ESEA. The school district will incorporate this district wide parental involvement policy into its LEA plan developed under section 1112 of the ESEA.</paragraph><paragraph parID="517">In carrying out the Title I, Part A parental involvement requirements, to the extent practicable, the school district and its schools will provide full opportunities for the participation of parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities, and parents of migratory children, including providing information and school reports required under section 1111 of the ESEA in an understandable and uniform format and, including alternative formats upon request, and, to the extent practicable, in a language parents understand. If the LEA plan for Title I, Part A, developed under section 1112 of the ESEA, is not satisfactory to the parents of participating children, the school district will submit any parent comments with the plan when the school district submits the plan to the State Department of Education. The school district will involve the parents of children served in Title I, Part A schools in decisions about how the 1 percent of Title I, Part A funds reserved for parental involvement is spent, and will ensure that not less than 95 percent of the one percent reserved goes directly to the schools. The school district will be governed by the following statutory definition of parental involvement, and expects that its Title I schools will carry out programs, activities and procedures in accordance with this definition: Parental involvement means the participation of parents in regular, two-way, and meaningful communication involving student academic learning and other school activities, including ensuring- (A) that parents play an integral role in assisting their child's learning; (B) that parents are encouraged to be actively involved in their child's education at school; (C) that parents are full partners in their child's education and are included, as appropriate, in decision-making and on advisory committees to assist in the education of their child; (D) the carrying out of other activities, such as those described in section 1118 of the ESEA . The school district will inform parents and parental organizations of the purpose and existence of the Parental Information and Resource Center in the State.

DISCRETIONARY DISTRICT WIDE FAMILY INVOLVEMENT POLICY COMPONENTS Parents found themselves having either to learn new skills or seek out those who could provide them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="531">There seems to have been a recognition early on among founder groups of the need to involve people whose professional expertise would be useful such as accountants and architects. The interval between the initial meetings of parents and the opening of the integrated schools was one of intense activity which grew increasingly more frenetic with the approach of the first term. Parents recall spending hours in discussion several times a week for months. Practical matters became very time-consuming. Once located, premises had to be made ready. By this stage parents were performing a wide variety of tasks, all designed to ensure that schools would be up and running by the planned date. As one parents said &#65533;there was something for everyone to do&#65533;.</paragraph><paragraph parID="532">There can be little doubt that this was an exhilarating period for those concerned. Many of those interviewed referred to the sheer excitement of being involved with something &#65533;new&#65533;. There was a definite element of nostalgia for this time among both parents and teachers. Once the schools were opened, parental involvement inevitably began to change its nature. Since it was seen as important that the spirit of co-operation should be maintained, many founder parents continued their association with &#65533;their&#65533; school, as trustees, directors and parents governors, They also began to realise that their work in setting up schools was only a beginning, and that the real task now lay ahead. This realisation was to be crucial in the development of their thinking about parental involvement. At the start they had chosen parental involvement as a major aim, but as time went on they began to appreciate that this was a more complex process than they had expected, &#65533;it seemed easy at the beginning&#65533;.</paragraph><paragraph parID="533">It is interesting that when founder parents were asked why they chose integrated education most said that they were initially attracted by the prospect of having a close relationship with their child&#65533;s school. In contrast, the later parents tended not to mention this as a reason for choice of school. At the beginning, integrated schools had chosen parental involvement as a major aim. Now that parents and schools were confronted with the job of putting it into practice, founder parents began to understand how difficult it was going to be to sustain parental interest at the same high level as before. Parental involvement had to be seen to be just as essential, interesting and worthwhile as before. We know a great deal about parental activities prior to the opening of the integrated schools. What has been the nature of their involvement now that these schools have been up and running, some of them for a number of years?</paragraph><paragraph parID="534">Although no two schools are alike, parental involvement in the integrated schools appears to operate through a number of levels. Such a concept of levels of involvement could be applied to all schools, not just integrated ones, and each level could be seen as indicative of a particular relationship which a parent has with the school. From this a model of an ascending ladder of levels can be postulated. A high level would mean a considerable involvement, while a low level would mean minimal involvement. Traditionally, parentschool relations have tended to operate at this kind of low level. Such involvement would usually be of a formal nature and school rather than parent orientated. Parents would visit schools when invited for parent-teacher evenings, open days and occasionally for matters of a disciplinary nature.</paragraph><paragraph parID="535">It is interesting to note that some of the materials produced by the European Parent&#65533;s Association indicates similar findings and asks the question &#65533;what are the psychological implications of parent-teacher contact tending to be only at times of crisis? We would suggest that the relationship between parent and school engendered by this type of structure can be narrow and one-sided. The parent appears to be interested only in his or her own child&#65533;s progress, and the school in how the parent can support their efforts to maximise this. It would be fair to say that most parents and probably a large number of schools have come to accept such a level of parental involvement as the norm. This type of involvement is found in the integrated schools but even here there is a difference. The &#65533;low&#65533; level of involvement had been taken up and the quality of it has been improved upon. Parents still visit schools when asked.</paragraph><paragraph parID="536">They do attend parent-teacher evenings. But these things tend to happen much more frequently so that communications between staff and parents is enhanced. To a great extent the relationship is still between the individual parent and teachers, but it appears deeper, less formal and in particular surrounded by fewer obstacles. There is little doubt that many parents in the integrated schools were more than satisfied with the level of involvement which they had achieved in this way and that both they and the teachers considered it to be beneficial to the children. It was interesting to note what parents and staff had to say about the traditional &#65533;meeting-ground&#65533;, that is discipline, for it was in this area that change seemed to have come. Both groups believed that the closer relationship meant that problems of this kind could be resolved more easily and quickly than before. Teachers did find parents very supportive in this area through some felt that they themselves had had to undergo a learning process in this respect.</paragraph><paragraph parID="537">The teacher must justify his/her actions. The whole question of discipline requires much more care than in other schools&#65533;. In the integrated schools, however, some parents extend their relationship beyond the basic teacher/parent level. In these ways, the focus of their relationship with the schools widens from that of the parent concerned with his/her child&#65533;s education per se, to a more global concern with the school as a whole. A sample of comments from parents may go some way to explaining why. The type of involvement needed now might not encourage some parents who would have been perfectly happy previously to come along and paint&#65533;. Some parents who were not founders felt they should be involved but &#65533;did not know what the school expected&#65533; of them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="538">No one had tried to explain what parental involvement was. Some thought that teachers themselves were equally unsure. One such parent said that from her own experience she had not been used to the idea of any &#65533;great input from parents&#65533;, but a senior teacher had talked about a parents&#65533; &#65533;drop-in room&#65533; which was to be set up in the school. The parent was looking forward to this although she did not know what the purpose of the room would be. It would be fair to say that induction programmes for &#65533;new parents have been tried in some instances, and it would seem that these would be even more needed as the parent body continues to expand well beyond the nucleus of the founder group. Some founder parents claimed that those who come &#65533;later&#65533; could not be expected to be as committed as they had been. Perhaps an explanation can be found in terms of perspective.</paragraph><paragraph parID="539">Parents who set up schools are not likely to do so for the sake of their own children alone. Their vision is usually wider than this. It has to be. Their involvement is directed at the school as a whole. To use Joan Sallis&#65533;s phrase, it is the difference between being a &#65533;representative parent and a parent representative&#65533; (Sallis, 1988). This is not to say that those who come later do not share this perspective - this would be quite wrong - the difference is that they may not necessarily realise that their role will be equally if not more demanding. In this sense, the comment of a founder parent that &#65533;they would not require the feeling of the original group but having enthusiasm will be sufficient&#65533; is perhaps misleading.</paragraph><paragraph parID="540">Parents&#65533; Councils are beginning to recognise the need to find a clearer focus for their meetings if parents are to continue to be attracted to them. We feel that there will be a need for them to appreciate that not all parents will have the staying power of the parent who said, &#65533;In spite of it all, I will continue to attend so that I can learn about the schools and on the off chance that the meetings may hold something for me&#65533;. To this end one Council had arranged for teaching staff to come along and talk about their work. This kind of meeting had been well received. Parents have also become involved with the schools beyond the levels described above as governors and/or directors. As a parent governor, the type of involvement is managerial and the form of the relationship between parent and school becomes much more specific and formal. One parent justified the demands of being a governor by saying &#65533;Who has more at stake in whether a school works or not than a parent?</paragraph><paragraph parID="541">Of course, although greater parental representation is possible on integrated schools&#65533; boards of governors and directors than is the case with controlled and maintained schools, not all parents who might want to can be governors or directors. The parents themselves offered a variety of reasons. This means that for many parents it appeared to be a different kind of relationship perhaps requiring different skills. Similar misgivings among parent governors have been noted by a research project which looked at the functioning of &#65533;democratised school government &#65533;in Birmingham primary schools in the early 1980&#65533;s (Pascal, 1988). Poor communication between Boards of Governors and Parents&#65533; Councils in some cases possibly exacerbated the perceived image of boards as rather remote. The new governor was never officially informed and only found out about it when she received an irate call from another governor asking why she had not been attending. Another reason often put forward for not wishing to become involved in the school at this level was the very considerable amount of time which would have to be set aside for frequent meetings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="542">Parental involvement in the integrated schools cannot therefore be defined in straightforward or definitive terms. It is the sum of many parts. It can mean different things to different people. It is not static but is still developing and changing as would be expected of any activity based on human relationships. There can be no norm because each school has pursued parental involvement in its own way. Any conclusions which we might offer will be general rather than specific. There are different levels of involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="543">Most parents are content to operate at the basic level, which in the integrated schools usually signifies a close two way relationship with teachers for the benefit of the child. At this level, parental activities broaden out from the relationship described above to a relationship with the school qua school. This is not to say that parental concern for the child&#65533;s education is lost, rather it becomes merged in a wider feeling for the institution which sustains it. Parents will be involved at this level as classroom assistants, members of working parties, fund-raisers and active members of Parents Council. Their numbers will tend to be fewer here because what is required of parents at this stage often appears unclear and irrelevant. Parents&#65533; Councils try to encourage participation but of all the levels of parental involvement it is perhaps at this one that parents can feel isolated as a group, even de-skilled and hence they begin to question the validity of what they are trying to do. This is perhaps why meetings which include teaching staff talking with parents are popular; they remind parents that they are still directly connected with their children&#65533;s education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="544">This fundamental involvement led parents to undertake a variety of tasks which would normally be the responsibility of an official body like a Local Education Authority or an Education and Library Board. These included providing and furnishing suitable premises, hiring teaching staff, selecting a principal and locating sources of funding. In most instances this had not presented a problem at the start, but as time went on numbers had begun to fall off. Significantly few parents expressed interest in becoming involved at this level. It would have been surprising if friends had not contacted friends of like mind or acquaintances on whom they could count to share their views on education. Northern Ireland&#65533;s population of one and a half million operates through a closely-knit series of social networks which easily accommodates this kind of interaction. In many cases the early meetings were held in private homes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="545">In this way discussions could take place and plans could be formulated undisturbed by attention from the media or the general public. Wider interest and support were usually only canvassed when groups felt sufficiently confident to do so. The initial groups often worked together very closely over a period of months or years. They had to overcome considerable problems in negotiating with official bodies and funders and had often put in enormous amounts of their own time. These periods of &#65533;quiet processes&#65533; bonded the founders together in a close fellowship of common aims and shared experiences which was to have important implications. Not surprisingly many of them were strong personalities with deep commitments and convictions; this often meant that they had very clear views about how the schools should develop and what aims an integrated school should have. They were usually anxious to avoid appearing critical of existing schools, and restricted their comments to the divisive nature of the system which nurtured the schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="546">Freedom to exercise choice is fundamental to integrationists, so founder parents were unlikely to deny others the right which they claimed for themselves. For perhaps the first time in Northern Ireland, parental choice was not to be limited to choice between two types of denominational schools. If the full exercise of choice involved establishing their own schools, ipso facto such parents were expressing dissatisfaction with an established system. The ramifications of this rejection were to reverberate far beyond the classroom. Once a school was operational and children began to be enrolled, the parent group inevitably widened, and as new parents who had not been involved in the foundation became associated with the school, tensions began to develop. On the one hand the founding parents tended to look back to the original tight group, and its struggles, with nostalgia - the period when there was &#65533;real&#65533; enthusiasm. Yet at the same time they were expressing anxieties about the low level of interest shown by &#65533;new&#65533; parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="547">They were also worried that some of their objectives might be lost as the parent group widened. The &#65533;new&#65533; parents who came into the group and were faced with taking responsibility for continuing the development of the school also expressed some anxieties. They were often not sure how to get involved and felt that the original group of parents formed an inner cabinet which it was hard to penetrate, which took a lot of decisions, and which sometimes seemed to resent interference. Many of those parents involved with the integrated schools from the very beginning have continued their association. This can be off-putting to newcomers. This tension between an &#65533;in&#65533; and an &#65533;out&#65533; group is familiar in many social organisations, but in a school it can be a particular problem. If one particular group establishes a monopoly on power, there is a danger that, once their children leave and their connection is broken, there will be no-one with sufficient experience to take over.</paragraph><paragraph parID="548">Continuity might be maintained if some parents retain their connection after their children have left. But this creates its own tensions as the priorities of those with children in a school and therefore a strong personal and individual interest, and of those with less direct interest but a primary concern for the general growth of the school, may diverge quite strongly. Again it was early to say how much of a problem this might be, but there was some indirect evidence. At the level of the organising groups, ACT and BELTIE, differences sometimes developed between those who were directly connected with individual schools as either parents or teachers, and those less immediately involved who wanted to exercise a more general overview role. All of this seems to raise the question of whether or not founder parents have a &#65533;shelf life&#65533;. Although our evidence is limited, it may be that a willingness to discuss community issues and the source of community divisions is a definite and positive characteristic of many of the people associated with integrated schools. Initially this request for background information was perceived by us as a preliminary to the main interview.</paragraph><paragraph parID="549">Some cited family commitments to one side or the other, and how these had affected them; a few had direct experience of the effects of violence on their family; and others had been particularly affected by their indirect experience of a specific incident. In Northern Ireland it may be difficult and dangerous to find practical ways of expressing such a view, so for some of these people the integrated schools were a relatively safe way of making a constructive statement. Almost all the parents interviewed talked about their concern over their children&#65533;s educational progress and for most of them the hope that their child would gain educationally had been a factor in the choice of an integrated school. In other words they were evaluating the school in terms of the quality of education it offered in the same way they would any other school. This does not mean, however, that the same educational criteria were being used by all the parents. In our sample differences can be detected between those sending their children to the primary schools and those sending children to the secondary school, and also between those who had enrolled their child in the first form of the school and those who had moved a child or children from another school to the integrated school. Comprehensive secondary education has only been introduced in a few areas in Northern Ireland.</paragraph><paragraph parID="550">Most parents are very anxious that their child should gain a place in a grammar school, but places are available for only about 30 per cent of each year group, and are allocated on the results of a competitive testing procedure. They do not admit pupils on the basis of the 11 + or &#65533;transfer procedure&#65533; results, but through a combination of personal parental application, report from the primary school and interview. This &#65533;de facto&#65533; comprehensive status means that for some parents the integrated schools are judged educationally as &#65533;not as good as a grammar school, but better than a secondary school&#65533;. At the same time the founder group can provide a sense of continuity, and can help &#65533;new&#65533; parents to understand the original aims of the school. One way of ensuring this is to continue to be involved in the life of the school until it becomes apparent that the structures which have been established are functioning as they intended them to. However, because of the openness of the discussion, it often had direct relevance to the central issues we were investigating. Many introduced an element of caution, and said that integrated education could not be a panacea; but it was for them &#65533;a step in the right direction&#65533;.</paragraph><paragraph parID="551">The use of questionnaires could have had the advantage of formal anonymity but it would have been difficult to design a questionnaire which would have produced sufficiently detailed information and still been manageable. Discussions with groups involved with integrated schooling during the design of the research also indicated that there would be hostility to questionnaires, particularly amongst parents and that the response rate would probably be low. On the other hand it was felt that individuals would be willing to talk about things which they would not be prepared to write down and that an ethnographic approach would be productive (Smith, 1978; Ball, 1983). We decided, therefore, that all information would be collected on a personal basis, either through attendance at meetings or through semi-structured personal interviews Dexter, 1970; Seldon, 1983; Moyser, 1987; Haplin, 1990). This procedure was inevitably time consuming and was one of the main reasons for the decision to concentrate investigation on three of the schools - one secondary and two primaries. However, the main focus of the work was on three identified schools. There were only eight schools in operation when the project began, ten throughout most of its life and twelve during the final report writing phase and each one was distinctive in some way.</paragraph><paragraph parID="552">This meant that the choice of sample could not hope to produce a set of &#65533;typical&#65533; integrated schools since no such thing exists. In the end the choice was based on judgment and a degree of pragmatism. We needed a primary and a secondary school, schools in urban and less urban environments, a range of social and demographic contexts and the support of the parents and teachers. Attendance at meetings of the parent&#65533;s councils (the main forum for the parents to express their views and comment on school policy) was negotiated and appointments for interviews with individual parents and teachers were set up. Inevitably the interviews presented some problems. In the case of the teachers the numbers were small enough (thirty five), for the research officer to be able to contact them all. It would, however, have been impossible to interview all the parents, and so a selection had to be made.</paragraph><paragraph parID="553">In each of the three schools the project was explained to a meeting of parents and also to a meeting of teachers. These contacts were usually willing to take part in interviews themselves and were also able to arrange introductions to other parents who could also be asked to take part. Whilst this procedure could not produce a random sample, we believe that, with time, patience and the establishment of an extensive range of personal contacts, we were able to reach a wide range of parents and build up sufficient trust to enable us to obtain extensive and very detailed interviews with a representative spectrum of parents associated with the three case study schools. The interviews were based on a semi-structured format to ensured that a range of topics were covered in each interview, though the order in which issued were raised varied depending on the ways interviewees responded. The semi-structured format used with parents and teachers was basically similar although some of the actual areas discussed were different because of the differing concerns of the two groups. At all times parents and teachers were extremely helpful, they gave a great deal of their time, took considerable interest in the project and answered question with a level of detail considerably greater than we had anticipated. One of the central aims of the research was to gain information about the ways in which parents have contributed to the development of the integrated schools and about how their relationships with the teaching staff have evolved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="554">A great deal of information about these two issues was obtained through the personal interviews and in order to structure this information, a number of major issues have been separated out and are examined in detail below. We were frequently told, usually by people with no connection with the schools, that &#65533;Its only middle class people who send their children to integrated schools&#65533; or &#65533;They (the integrated schools) are for liberal intellectuals&#65533; or &#65533;It&#65533;s people who couldn&#65533;t get on in the ordinary schools&#65533;. In order to classify the parents of children at the schools in terms of standard social class categories, data would be needed about occupations. During the personal interviews, which were often carried out in parents&#65533; homes, impressions were formed about the social background of individuals, and discussions with teachers and principals also contributed information in this area. The north Belfast schools are situated in a very mixed social area and have a large number of children from working class backgrounds, whilst the south Belfast schools are in more middle class areas and consequently are likely to have a different mix. Certainly the stereotype of the middle class intellectual, liberal, non-conformist as the typical integrated school parent does seem a serious over-simplification. Some of the parents we interviewed had fairly recently become involved with the schools, whilst others had been connected with the integrated school movement from its earliest stages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="555">As hinted above, during the course of the research, we became aware that there were some difference between those parents who were involved in the early stages of the development of the integrated schools and those whose links with the schools began when they sent their child to an already established integrated school. These two groups might be referred to as the &#65533;founding&#65533; parents and the &#65533;following&#65533; parents. It must be questionable whether, in situations where a group was not driven by such a clear commitment and such strong underlying beliefs, parents or teachers would be prepared to put in so much time. Even in the integrated schools some of those who were active at the founding stage indicate that they now feel 'burnt out' and at the same time they are anxious that parents and teachers who are now coming into the schools may not be so ideologically committed and so may not be prepared to invest so much time and energy. It is not at all clear what are the long term consequences of a relatively small group of individuals with very strong views having a major input into the policy of a school. The debate over the extent to which the schools should be 'Christian' in their ethos and how this should affect the attitude to the participation of teachers, parents and children of other religious backgrounds or none is related to this and is producing a range of strong opinions. Schools as institutions usually have a long life, well in excess of the child-rearing span of any one family, but individual parents have a much shorter period of direct active participation in their family's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="556">In a situation where parents have a strong voice in the management of a school, a group of parents with a clear ideology may influence school policy in a particular direction only to be replaced in a relatively short period by another group who may have quite different aspirations for the school. As was made clear in the first section of this report the integrated schools developed outside the formal religious, political and administrative structures of Northern Ireland. Once the first schools had been established the attitude shifted from one which could have been characterised as 'we don't want it, but it won't happen anyway' to one which saw the integrated school movement as unwelcome but too small to have to worry about. In the case of the integrated school movement to find and exploit any such weakness has been very difficult since they received no help or support from any official groups or organisations on either side of the community - they could not be portrayed as agents of either Unionism, Nationalism or British government policy. Since financing the establishment of each school has been such a difficult undertaking, the order seeks to provide a financial structure which will assist parents wishing to set up new schools and also provides incentives for turning existing schools into integrated schools. What began as a 'grassroots' movement outside all official structures now has government support. Any official support or recognition carries dangers in Northern Ireland and the integrated school movement will have to come to terms with the delicate task of establishing a relationship with DENI whilst at the same time preserving a high level of visible independence.</paragraph><paragraph parID="557">Individual schools have continued to be established as a result of the work of local pressure groups and there has been no planned sequence in the opening of schools and no general policy concerning the geographical distribution of schools. After almost ten years and with fourteen schools in operation (1992) there is now considerable pressure both from the foundations and the government for the development of a more coherent policy and organisational structure. The foundations do not wish to continue to be asked to respond to individual local initiatives and government have to try to operate the new legislation in the Education Reform Order relating to integrated schools. One of the things which originally attracted many of the founders to become involved with integrated schools was the 'grassroots' nature of the enterprise and the freedom from a central bureaucracy. To move to a position where a body such as NICIE could speak on behalf of the schools or negotiate for them would be seen by many parents and teachers as undermining their roles. This question of forward planning is clearly linked to the various possible future patterns of and roles for integrated education within the Northern Irish education system. At present both parents and teachers seem to see the future mainly in terms of the expansion of the school they are connected with, plus a general interest in seeing 'more schools' in other parts of the province.</paragraph><paragraph parID="558">Breaking The Mould: The Roles of Parents and Teachers in the Integrated Schools in Northern Ireland Reproduction or redistribution for commercial purposes is not permitted. Before publishing a research report, the Centre for the Study of Conflict submits it to members of a panel of external referees. The establishment, during the last decade, of a number of planned integrated schools in Northern Ireland has been one of the most important structural changes in the Northern Ireland education system since the foundation of the state (Dunn &amp; Morgan, 1988). It was natural, therefore, that the Centre should, over many years, have taken a prominent part in attempting to analyse and understand the role of education in a divided society (Dunn, 1986a; Dunn &amp; Smith, 1989b; Gallagher, 1989). Against this background, and because they reflected the existence of social division, academics from the Centre took an interest in the development of the integrated schools from the outset. At first this posed problems since the schools were very new, few in number and small in size, and because there was a fear amongst some of those directly involved with their establishment that research interventions could be harmful or even dangerous.</paragraph><paragraph parID="559">There were then seven planned integrated schools (two secondary and five primary) and the researchers were aware of the danger that if investigations were not initiated quickly much information about the early stages of the integrated school movement might be lost. It arose out of a long period of consultation with a number of teachers, parents and other individuals some of whom had been involved with the movement for integrated education from its inception and many of whom had been active in the founding and running of specific schools. how parents become aware of and involved in the planned integrated school movement; what parents hope will be the outcomes for themselves, their children and the wider community; how parents see the relationship between themselves and the teaching staff of the schools, including whether they are conscious of actual or possible areas of tension or difficulty; the relationship of parents and teachers connected with the planned integrated schools to other official bodies such as central and local government departments, the churches and the teaching unions. In addition to providing information about the interactions of parents and teachers in the specific context of the integrated schools in Northern Ireland, we also hoped that the findings would make a useful contribution to the wider debate, currently in progress in the United Kingdom, about the organisation and control of schools and the implications of more extensive parental involvement and higher levels of teacher-parent interaction (Adler et al, 1989; Adler et al, 1990; Bottery, 1990a; Brown, 1990; Flude &amp; Hammer, 1990; Maclure, 1989).</paragraph><paragraph parID="560">The last three years have also been a period of rapid educational change, both in the general education scene in Northern Ireland and further afield, and also in the specific area of integrated schools. These included the Schools Cultural Studies Project and the Religion in Ireland Project which were curriculum projects, strongly affected by reconstructionist models of education and the ideas of John Dewey. These were particularly influenced by Malcolm Skilbeck, who was at the time Professor of Education in the New University of Ulster and who for a short period had a considerable impact on educational thinking in Northern Ireland (Robinson, 1987). The communities appeared to be becoming more polarised, and the hopes of success for any pressure group, especially one interested in a structural change as profound as modifying the basis of the education system, looked very slight. Whilst ACT favoured a gradual expansion of integrated schools and was anxious that Lagan and Forge should become firmly established and prove their viability before other schools opened, BELTIE supported a faster expansion policy, feeling that the integrated schools needed to make a rapid impact in as many areas of Northern Ireland as possible. Although the structure of education in Northern Ireland is complex, with controlled, maintained and voluntary schools, a set of relationships between the Department of Education, the local Education and Library Boards, the churches and the teaching unions have been established over the years, and these work relatively smoothly. The Roman Catholic hierarchy have challenged, in the High Court, the provisions in the Reform order for the financial support of integrated schools and although this has failed in law, feelings of grievance remain.</paragraph><paragraph parID="561">It will already be clear from the previous section that many of the issues surrounding the establishment and current operation of the integrated schools are extremely complicated and potentially sensitive in political terms. At primary level the choice available to parents is less constrained, at least in theory. A child can be enrolled in any controlled primary school of the parents choice, similarly parents can apply to have a child enrolled in any maintained primary school. The only restrictions relate to the provision of free transport, the relevant regulation states that the cost of transport will be paid to the nearest suitable&#65533; school, and this is interpreted to take account of the existence of the two separate school systems and the right of parents to exercise a choice on grounds of religious denomination. The religious divide is very rarely crossed and almost all children attend the neighbourhood primary school appropriate to their own community, which will be &#65533;controlled&#65533; if they are Protestant and &#65533;maintained&#65533; if they are Roman Catholic. The purely educational grounds for enrolling a child in the reception class of an integrated school are, therefore, less clear cut than in the secondary case. Some parents did suggest that they chose an integrated school because they felt it would place less emphasis on preparation for the 11 + than other primary schools, whilst others seemed to be motivated mainly by dissatisfaction with a school of which they had direct experience and this had precipitated a move.</paragraph><paragraph parID="562">One significant factor, however, is the availability of nursery units linked to most of the integrated schools. Nursery provision is very limited in Northern Ireland, and so the availability of nursery places in the units attached to the integrated schools has proved very attractive to parents. In theory there is no reason why a child should not attend the nursery class of an integrated school and then transfer to the local controlled or maintained primary school&#65533;s reception class. But in fact almost all the children do go directly from the nursery to the reception class. This nursery provision in the primary schools may, like the comprehensive status of the secondary schools, have the effect of bringing a group of parents, who do not have an initial ideological commitment, into the integrated school movement. It is interesting that whilst some of the founding parents would see this widening of the base for integrated education as desirable others would express anxiety about possible dilution of the ideals of integration. There are very few nursery units in Northern Ireland and government funding for education of under four year olds has been limited.</paragraph><paragraph parID="563">As a result very few controlled or maintained primary schools have been able to develop any nursery provision. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that the development of units attached to the integrated primary schools has generated considerable hostility amongst other members of the teaching profession. Interviews with a group of principals of controlled and maintained primary school indicated that, although they accept that the integrated schools have to fund the nurseries themselves, they believe that their very existence represents &#65533;unfair competition&#65533;. (c) Dissatisfaction with existing schools In addition to the parents who sent their child to an integrated school at the beginning of nursery, primary or secondary education, there were also a number of parents who moved their child to an integrated school part-way through a phase of education. This was rather a distinct group which was probably more numerous in the early phases of each school&#65533;s development. Some of these parents were so strongly committed to integrated schooling that they moved</paragraph><paragraph parID="564">their child out of an existing controlled or maintained school as soon as the integrated school opened. This set included most of the founding parents with children of appropriate age. But there were also parents not so closely linked to the founding of the schools who were in some way dissatisfied with the existing system and saw the integrated school as a way out of their problem. Within this category there were further variations. Some parents had moved because they felt a general dissatisfaction with the existing schools; amongst the views expressed were that the schools in Northern Ireland were too formal, that they did not provide an education with enough emphasis on the child, and that because of this formality it was difficult for parents to talk to teachers or to discuss their concerns. For such parents the &#65533;child-centred&#65533; aims of the integrated schools, and the emphasis on close parent-staff contacts, were very attractive. In addition, in the early phases of each school&#65533;s development, classes were usually small, and this was also cited by some parents, although in most cases this is now ceasing to be a factor as the schools grow.</paragraph><paragraph parID="565">These were fairly generalised reasons for changing school but there were also parents who were more specific. Some children had been transferred into the integrated school because of a perceived lack of educational progress or because of emotional or behavioural difficulties. In some of these cases children were moved at a fairly late stage of primary education because of a history of difficulty, sometimes in the form of learning or behavioural problems. Such children had often already been moved between schools at least once before and they usually transferred into the upper classes (P5, 6 or 7) of the integrated schools. This type of move was most common during the first years after a school opened, when numbers were small in the upper forms and there was some pressure to take pupils. The results were predictably varied, in some cases parents were satisfied that the child did benefit, in others they were disappointed and felt there was little &#65533;improvement&#65533;. There was also some anxiety from other parents and from teachers that too many potentially disruptive children might come</paragraph><paragraph parID="566">into the schools and create additional difficulties at a time when just getting started was already a hard task. (d) Convenience It may seem surprising in discussing a movement which has involved such a level of commitment and controversy, to find that for some parents the choice of an integrated school was a matter of convenience. However, quite a number of those interviewed did indicate that they sent their child to the school because it was the nearest school, or was easy to reach on their way to work. It is interesting that proximity and convenience were mentioned quite frequently by parents in a strongly Protestant working-class area close to one of the primary schools. Many of these parents came from relatively &#65533;hard-line&#65533; working class Protestant backgrounds, and they did not see their child&#65533;s attendance at an integrated school as conflicting with their loyalist political views or as threatening their children&#65533;s identity. (e) Mixed Marriages</paragraph><paragraph parID="567">One particular group for whom the establishment of the integrated schools appears to have presented a particularly welcome new choice is parents in &#65533;mixed marriages&#65533;. In Northern Ireland &#65533;mixed marriage&#65533; does not mean a marriage across racial divisions but one between a Roman Catholic and a Protestant. Society&#65533;s reaction to such marriages is very variable but they are often the source of considerable conflict and bitterness within families. In some cases one or both partners may be estranged from their family for a period, and in extreme cases permanently. One &#65533;mixed marriage&#65533; parent offered the succinct comment, &#65533;where mixed marriages are concerned, they often seem more important to other people than to those involved&#65533;. The proportion of mixed marriages varies considerably in different parts of Northern Ireland. In some areas they are very uncommon, while in others between twelve and fifteen percent of marriages involve partners from the two communities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="568">One of the case study schools is in an area where the proportion is over ten per cent. Our interviews included a considerable number of parents involved in mixed marriages and it became clear that the integrated schools presented a particularly important choice for them, since religious upbringing and choice of school are so closely linked. Interviewees indicated that the question of the education of children was usually discussed at the outset of the marriage, long before children were born, and then again with much more immediacy once children were born and began to approach school age. Existing evidence suggests that children of mixed marriages are frequently brought up in the religion of the mother, and attend the appropriate school, and that this is particularly so when the mother is a Roman Catholic (Compton, 1989). In addition grandparents seem to exert considerable pressure over their grandchildren&#65533;s religious upbringing and education. The parents interviewed in our study suggested that the existence of an integrated school prevented considerable friction both between the parents and in the wider family circle. In some cases parents said that once they had chosen an integrated school they felt a great sense of relief.</paragraph><paragraph parID="569">Some felt it was other members of the family who &#65533;bothered&#65533; most about the children&#65533;s education and the choice of an integrated school helped to placate them. One Roman Catholic mother recalled that her mother was not pleased that she did not choose a maintained school but was better pleased than she would have been if a controlled school had been chosen. The integrated schools provide a possibility of compromise within a society where stark choices are all too frequently the norm. For this reason they are seen as very important by individuals who in their own personal lives have stepped outside the rigid divisions. Where there is no such compromise available the choice of school can create the perception that either the father or the mother has had to &#65533;give up&#65533; something. The integrated school allows them to avoid this. In a wider sense the integrated school also helps to validate the mixed marriage itself by providing a context in which cross community contact is celebrated and parents are able to mix with other people who either share their experience or are sympathetic to it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="570">This provides a form of support difficult to obtain elsewhere. However, once the choice is made, there are still problems to be solved. Religious education in the integrated schools is provided partially through a common curriculum which seeks to emphasise shared Christian values. But separate religious teaching is also provided, particularly in the primary schools where provision is made for specific requirements, such as preparing children for the sacraments of First Communion and Confirmation in the Roman Catholic church. Parents then decide whether or not their children are to receive this additional denominational teaching; for parents in a mixed marriage this could still be contentious as it would to some extent &#65533;identify&#65533; the children with one or other denomination. In fact the interviews suggest that the system works quite well, perhaps because there has not been the need for a clear cut choice of a denominational school, and so specific issues about doctrine seemed less threatening. However, the need to provide very specific teaching to meet the requirements of the Roman Catholic church, when there is no clear parallel requirement from the Protestant churches, has lead some people to suggest that the Roman Catholic church is still exerting great power even in the integrated schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="571">How they think attendance at an integrated school affects their children? We were interested in what the parents wanted from the integrated school and whether their expectations were being met. The decision to send a child to an Integrated School is clearly not the end of the parent&#65533;s concern. Once the child is enrolled the focus shifts to the experience itself, and how it is affecting the child. We therefore asked a number of questions about these issues. In general the parents expressed the normal range of views and concerns of any parent about the formal educational progress of their children. Most parents said that they were generally happy with the way the curriculum subjects were being presented, though there were specific points about the progress of individual children in particular subjects or classes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="572">Some parents commented that their child had made much better progress since being moved to an integrated school, while a few expressed disappointment that there had not been the hoped for improvements. Our research focus meant that we were particularly interested in how parents felt the schools were affecting their children&#65533;s social development. Integration is centrally about contact between the two communities in Northern Ireland and about improving relationships. When questions were asked about the children&#65533;s social development, and more specifically about effects on their responses to the &#65533;other&#65533; community, parents were perhaps understandably vague. The questions seemed to give them the opportunity to articulate their own aspirations for the schools rather than to describe the effects on their children. They wanted the schools to foster tolerance and openness, awareness of the culture and traditions of the other community and also a pride in their own background. The word which kept cropping up was &#65533;awareness&#65533;; the parents seemed especially anxious that their children should &#65533;know&#65533; about the other community, its traditions, religious beliefs and so on.</paragraph><paragraph parID="573">One parent believed that his son was already more tolerant than his father and added that he hoped his son &#65533;would go further than he had towards the other community&#65533;. On a rather wider scale parents quite often indicated that they hoped the schools would be part of a long term solution to the &#65533;troubles&#65533; in Northern Ireland. They did not see the schools as a simple direct solution but as a more subtle indirect influence. Comments such as &#65533;they will be seen to work&#65533;, &#65533;they are an example of what is possible&#65533; and &#65533;they make people think&#65533;, catch the flavour of the views expressed. One parent was pleased that there was already a measure of attendance from &#65533;hard&#65533; areas which indicated &#65533;a hopeful break in attitude. The ice has been broken. Another issue was whether the schools should directly teach content which would contribute to improved community relations through the formal curriculum or whether such objectives would be better achieved through the hidden or para curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="574">The responses suggest that, whilst they were quite happy that their children should study topics which would help them to understand both sides of Northern Ireland&#65533;s cultural, literary and historical background, they felt that the actual presence of the pupils and teachers from the two communities in the one institution was the crucial factor. In other words they saw the hidden curriculum, as the most important feature of the schools. There was also some evidence of an interaction or even possibly a confusion between two sets of aims for the schools. The importance of integration was usually stressed but there was also the hope that the schools would be more &#65533;child-centred&#65533; than most of the other schools in the province. This may seem a slightly outdated phrase in to-day&#65533;s educational world, but there is clearly a strand within the integrated school movement which sees changes, towards a more &#65533;liberal&#65533;, child-centred model, as one of the prime objectives of the establishment of new schools. In a complex situation many features of the schools appear to serve different purposes for different parents, but the resulting contradictions currently seem to be causing little difficulty. Certainly, the consensus of opinion amongst those interviewed was that their children were &#65533;happy&#65533; at their integrated schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="575">Overall the parents seemed proud of their association with integrated schools. This is expressed openly as a sense of achievement, one parent said she was pleased &#65533;to have stuck it out&#65533; and to &#65533;have followed it through&#65533;. Some parents said they talked about the school to others and always praised it. (Although in contrast one parent said that, although she was happy with the school, she did not have the right to try to influence the judgment of others). Many parents felt that they had undergone some form of personal development as a result of their association with the integrated school. I learned about education and in particular about how the school was working&#65533;. This might be described as &#65533;education by association&#65533;.</paragraph><paragraph parID="576">Although, of course this was not universal and some argued that they had not been affected so much. A number claimed that as they were &#65533;liberal&#65533; before they became involved with the schools they did not experience a major change in attitude. Parental involvement, how parents are involved with the schools In conventional terms parental involvement has been taken to mean parents and teachers working in a close partnership for the benefit of the child (Blackstone, 1979; Beattie, 1985; Docking, 1990). In the context of integrated education the phrase &#65533;parental involvement&#65533; has come to have new meaning because the schools have been set up by parents. They do not owe their existence to the local Education and Library Boards or to the Department of Education for Northern Ireland or to any of the churches. They are there because parents wanted them to be there, because parents were willing to undertake the task of creating schools which would provide the kind of education they wanted for their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="577">For founder parents, parental involvement predates and parallels the life of the school. It is both fundamental and developmental. The relationship of the founder parent to the school sometimes seemed almost like that of the parent to the child, an emotional attachment with all the attendant responsibilities, fears, tensions, and of course joys. This issue of dissatisfaction will be dealt with in more detail in the next section. Again, parents involved at the next level have a different kind of relationship with the school. This time they are sharing in management and are, therefore, taking an active part in the running of the school. This kind of involvement seemed to hold little appeal for most parents because it was perceived as the domain of the professional person, who could presumably cope with areas like institutional finance which were perceived as being beyond the competence of the &#65533;ordinary&#65533; parent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="578">Research based in Exeter (Brigley, 1990; Golby, 1989a; Golby, 1989b), has shown how many parent governors felt overwhelmed by the demands being imposed upon them by such new legislation. This in itself would be off-putting to some. It is possible that as far as parental attitudes to the Boards of Governors are concerned the situation in the integrated schools reinforces evidence from other sources. The larger number of parent representatives on the Boards is not in itself a guarantee of increased interest and there are still severe problems in attracting a wide range of people. Areas of concern for parents For example, the fact that the schools were new and had no &#65533;track record&#65533; meant that parents were anxious about academic standards. As one said &#65533;will the school match up to other schools in the area?</paragraph><paragraph parID="579">Perhaps because of this lack of hard evidence about the comparative standing of the schools some parents were sensitive to details which they felt might indicate something about discipline or standards. For some parents, therefore, it would seem that integrated education did not mean a move away from the &#65533;traditional&#65533; values. Their expectations in this respect seem to have been no different from those of most other parents outside integrated schools. The only general concern seemed to be about children attending an integrated school who might have to &#65533;go back&#65533; into the segregated system. This could happen if the family moved to an area out of reach of an integrated school, since the geographical coverage is still limited. More frequently, however, it was an issue at the end of primary schooling or at entry to sixth form. For the parents with children reaching the end of primary education there was a real dilemma.</paragraph><paragraph parID="580">Outside Belfast there are no integrated secondary schools, and, given the demographic pattern in Northern Ireland, the prospects of setting up viable integrated secondary schools (except in one or two areas) do not seem good. So parents have to choose either a maintained or a controlled secondary school. The seriousness of this problem varied with geographical location and was also related to the child&#65533;s likelihood of passing the eleven plus examination. In some areas there are secondary schools with a tradition of taking a small number of pupils across the community divide and parents saw these as schools which might be sympathetic to children from an integrated primary school. There was also a clear sense that the problem was not too serious if the child passed the eleven plus and could go to a grammar school, since these were perceived as less sectarian in their culture than the secondary intermediate schools. There is little evidence either way about this, but the perception does exist. But in some areas, going from an integrated primary school to secondary school is a real cause for concern.</paragraph><paragraph parID="581">This concern may or may not be valid, but it arose from the perception that many secondary schools had considerable numbers of pupils with strong loyalist or republican sympathies. At the time of the research neither of the integrated secondary schools had a sixth form and pupils who wished to do &#65533;A&#65533; levels had to move from them to a local grammar school. The other central group in this research was teachers and a series of personal interviews was carried out, essentially similar to those conducted with parents. The interviews with teachers began by asking them to describe their professional career. In this way information was collected about their qualifications, training, and previous appointments. This allowed us to build up a picture of the professional background of the teachers in the integrated schools. From this it is clear that their demographic and educational characteristics are very similar to those of the general teaching force in Northern Ireland.</paragraph><paragraph parID="582">In line with the policy of the integrated school movement the teaching force is &#65533;balanced&#65533;, that is, as near as possible equal numbers of teachers from the two communities are employed in each school. The teachers ranged from newly qualified graduates in their first year of teaching, to teachers with over thirty years of experience who were approaching the end of their professional careers. The majority of the primary teachers had been trained in Northern Ireland, at the Roman Catholic teacher training college St. Mary&#65533;s, at Stranmillis College which trains teachers for the controlled schools or at the University of Ulster, Coleraine, which has an integrated teacher training course. There was also a few primary teachers who had trained at colleges in other parts of the United Kingdom. In the secondary school the range of qualifications was wider, as might be expected. Graduates of the two Northern Irish universities, Queen&#65533;s University, Belfast and the University of Ulster, were in the majority, but there were also teachers who had completed their higher education in Great Britain and in the Republic of Ireland. Whilst the majority of the teachers had been born in Northern Ireland and lived there throughout their lives, there were also a number who had been born in the province but then lived and worked elsewhere for a period.</paragraph><paragraph parID="583">Usually they had taught in England or Scotland for a time after qualifying and then returned either directly to their present post or via a post in a non-integrated school. But there were a few who had worked further afield, in Africa and America. There were also a few who originated outside the province, either from Britain or the Republic of Ireland, and they had originally come to Northern Ireland for a variety of reasons, such as to attend university, as a result of marriage or to a job. None of those born outside Northern Ireland who were interviewed had come specifically to take a post in an integrated school. In contrast, there were one or two of those born in Northern Ireland who had come back, after considerable periods of teaching in Britain or overseas, deliberately to work in an integrated school. It is of course impossible to make accurate comparisons, since the detailed statistical data are not available. However, we did feel that the proportion of teachers with some experience of living outside Northern Ireland was higher in these schools than in the established schools of the province.</paragraph><paragraph parID="584">All the teachers who had had previous appointments in Northern Ireland had taught in schools which had an overwhelming majority of pupils from one community. From their own comments about their background and their previous teaching experience we gained the impression that a number of them had been dissatisfied in the segregated school system and that quite a lot of them perceived themselves as &#65533;outsiders&#65533; even before they made the move. As one teacher commented she was &#65533;at odds with the system&#65533;. In such situations they may well have felt that although the move to an integrated school looked like a risk, given their history they had less than most others to lose as they were already on the edges of the conventional mainstream of the teaching profession in Northern Ireland. Why teachers came into the integrated schools? An important first question was, why had they decided to apply for and accept a post in an integrated school. This was particularly important given that these teachers were in most respects very similar to the general teaching force in the province.</paragraph><paragraph parID="585">As with parental choice there proved to be a wide range of motives often with considerable overlap. We will attempt to analyse these under four headings, but this is to some extent an artificial division since in many cases elements from several categories were referred to by an individual teacher. They had chosen to teach in an integrated school because they believed that the establishment of such schools would contribute to improved community relations in Northern Ireland. Many of them talked about their own experiences at school, college or university as having been important in making them think about the effects of separation on children and young people. Several talked about never having met members of the &#65533;other&#65533; side until they went to university and suggested that this was almost &#65533;too late&#65533;. Integration from an early age&#65533;, one maintained, &#65533;would prevent misinformation&#65533;. Another recalled how, coming from a mixed but relatively troublefree area to train at a Catholic college, had not prepared her for the bitterness of feelings expressed by some of her fellow students who had been reared in the polarised communities of the city or the borders.</paragraph><paragraph parID="586">One teacher claimed that her training in an &#65533;integrated&#65533; environment rather than a denominational college had &#65533;prepared&#65533; her well for teaching in an integrated school. However, it was also clear that clerical opposition usually at the parish level meant that this kind of training is not an easy option for Catholic students hoping to teach in the province. In general, the teachers believed that, not only was it wrong to educate children separately but that, in the words of one experienced teacher, it was necessary to oppose it &#65533;in practical terms, not just by speaking out against it&#65533;. So, as with the parents, there was a feeling from the teachers that the schools offered individuals the opportunity to give tangible expression to their desire for improved community relations. In some ways this was even more of a commitment for the teachers since they were staking their career and their financial security on the future of the schools and in most cases expected to have a long term, possibly a lifetime, involvement in integrated education. It is clear that some parents, when they were considering sending their children to an integrated school, were impressed by this, as one said, &#65533;Teachers were making a major commitment. They were putting their careers on the line.</paragraph><paragraph parID="587">This was convincing&#65533;. (b) Religious Commitment With regard to religious commitments, the views expressed by the teachers are closely related to those of the parents. For some this meant that they were experiencing a stressful conflict between their loyalty to their church and their deeply held personal religious views. In other cases the views of clergy had led them to distance themselves from formal religious structures and to rely on their own interpretation of Christian values. One teacher, who expressed her views in this area particularly clearly, summed up many of the main points raised. Although she taught Religious Education within the school she felt that religion should be the concern of the family and should not determine the choice of school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="588">She based her views directly on her experience of teaching in both maintained and controlled sectors. Neither of these had suited her: she found the maintained schools &#65533;narrow-minded&#65533; and talked about the &#65533;catholic twilight syndrome&#65533;. In controlled schools, on the other hand, she felt &#65533;constrained&#65533; and was not &#65533;free&#65533;. For instance she was very aware that minor features of her speech, such as the way she pronounced the sound &#65533;h&#65533;, immediately revealed her ethnic identity. Constrained was a term she used frequently about both types of schools. By moving to an integrated school she hoped that she &#65533;could be herself&#65533;. She &#65533;wanted to be a catholic without having to apologise for it&#65533; and she felt that the integrated school provided a possibility of making that hope a reality.</paragraph><paragraph parID="589">(c) Educational Reasons Many of the teachers cited educational considerations as a reason for their move into integrated education. They saw in the schools the possibility of working in an environment with a different educational ethos. A number recalled how, at the interview for a post in the school, they felt it necessary to convince the panel that, if appointed, they would be able to fit in with regard to child-centred education, a different approach to discipline and so on. The main point was that the existing schools were very formal and hierarchical and that the integrated schools seemed to hold out the possibility of a more relaxed and &#65533;caring&#65533; educational environment. The desire for a more &#65533;child-centred&#65533; education voiced by some of the parents was also echoed by teachers. Dislike of single-sex schools, and unhappiness about the eleven plus selection procedure, were also mentioned, especially by the secondary school teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="590">One teacher commented that, &#65533;I was unhappy about teaching in a system where the school appeared to be run for itself, rather than for the children&#65533;. The newness, the rhetoric of participation and the challenge of making integrated education work, were all mentioned as factors which had attracted them. Amongst the principals there were individuals with clearly developed educational philosophies and they felt that they were now able, for the first time, to try to put these into practice. The centrality of &#65533;valuing&#65533; the child, and giving each individual a sense of his or her own worth, were at the core of the philosophy of one of the principals. This approach was being closely linked to integration through the concept that only pupils who were confident of their own value could in turn value and respect others, especially others who differed from them in religion, culture or political aspirations. (d) Career Move In addition to the motives related to social, political, religious and educational values, the teachers also expressed strictly practical reasons for their move to a post in an integrated school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="591">Quite a few indicated that they had been unable to secure promotion in their previous school and had been trying to change job in order to get a scaled post, a departmental headship or a principalship. In most cases they had applied for several posts of which the integrated school job was one. However some did suggest that their own educational views made promotion in the established schools unlikely; one said &#65533;because of my attitudes I would never have been promoted&#65533;. There was also a hint about gender related discrimination in the case of two mid-career female teachers who argued that they had failed to get promotion in their last school, despite lengthy service and wide experience. We specifically asked parents if there were issues relating to integrated education which were causing them concern. Many of the points which emerged in response to this question have already been touched on in the sections on educational issues. Anxiety over issues like the use of first names for some staff in one school and the presence of litter in another were indications of concern over discipline.</paragraph><paragraph parID="592">Similarly, there were also a number of views expressed about uniform and whether pupils looked &#65533;neat&#65533;. As with the parents there was a clear sense of commitment on the part of many of the teachers. It was often difficult to separate religious and ideological motives. They had to organise the curriculum, especially with reference to such potentially sensitive areas as religious education, set up management structures to carry through the objective of close parental involvement and handle the immediate practical problems of buildings, furniture and resources. Also debatable is whether such a level of involvement could be achieved in schools which did not have such a strong underlying ideology and such a distinctive social context. The response to the actual existence of an integrated school in the area was one of deliberate non-involvement. For some of the teachers their post in an integrated school was their first teaching post since qualifying, or their first permanent post.</paragraph><paragraph parID="593">Although generalisations are dangerous, there was some evidence that the main difference between teachers&#65533; motives for working in integrated schools were related to their age and career stage. The youngest teachers had not always been too conscious of the special nature of the integrated schools when they applied for their posts. The experience of teaching in an integrated school We were anxious to find out what the experience of teaching in an integrated school was like for teachers. We wished to know whether working in an integrated school was actually different. The planning and presentation of lessons, marking work, preparation for examinations, handling classroom discipline and the day-to-day management of the school went on much as in any other school. It permeates all attitudes - to parents, the curriculum, even inter-staff relations&#65533;.</paragraph><paragraph parID="594">Linked to this perception, some teachers felt they were more aware of the things they said in the classroom; the fact that children from both communities were in the room made them very sensitive about their choice of words. This seemed to affect the secondary school teachers particularly, and in subjects such as history, literature and religious education the teachers were aware of some changes in their classroom presentation. It was also obvious that Religious Education did present particular problems for the primary schools where few teachers were specialists. There was concern about the question of &#65533;balance&#65533;, how to construct a syllabus which would reflect equally the traditions of the two major faiths. One Catholic teacher worried that she was not achieving a balance because it was difficult for her to come to terms with what she referred to as the &#65533;less tangible nature of Protestantism&#65533;. The teachers themselves have, therefore, to become part of the wider learning process. There was evidence that teachers were concerned about the meaning of integrated education, that they were indeed, &#65533;conscious of the need to be different&#65533;, and worried if they perceived that they were not.</paragraph><paragraph parID="595">Just like the founder parents, teachers realised that integrated education was an ongoing business which needed &#65533;continual working at&#65533;. One experienced teacher who referred to the school as her &#65533;fifth child&#65533;, argued that one hundred percent commitment was needed because &#65533;the ethos has to be worked at harder. As the school has grown there are more parents, more children and more teachers, so the school has to be &#65533;sold&#65533; to them&#65533;. There was much comment about the structural and organisational aspects of the schools and it was here that the teachers were most aware of contrasts. Since teachers in all schools are currently expressing anxiety about the time needed to handle the demands of the National Curriculum and management changes such as LMS, the work that has had to be done in the integrated schools provides concrete evidence and experience of the effects of such change. A distinction must be made between the initial stages of each school&#65533;s life and what might be described as the &#65533;ongoing&#65533; situation. All the teachers who had experienced or were experiencing the first year of a school&#65533;s operation were overwhelmed by the time demands made during that year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="596">There were almost daily meetings at lunch time, after school and in the evenings during the first year. Since all the schools have been independent during their first year or two of operation, each has been through a period where they have had to handle their management and finance alone. After the early phase, when structures have been established and some of the financial worries have eased there is a degree of let-up, but the management patterns of the integrated schools and the specific objective of close parent-teacher co-operation mean that there is still a heavy commitment to meetings. In the primary schools they have the added problem of a full teaching load since the schools are currently too small to qualify for a non-teaching principal. The schools have a stated policy of trying to retain a numerical balance between the two communities in pupils, teaching staff, ancillary staff and governing bodies. Teachers suggested that this can produce artificial structures and place constraints on the choice of staff, especially when the school is relatively small and the balance can hinge on one appointment. This was particularly the case in the primary schools where there seems to be a convention that if the principal is from one community the vice-principal should, if at all possible, be a member of the other.</paragraph><paragraph parID="597">They felt that it was especially important that the community outside the schools should see them as &#65533;fair&#65533; and not as tilting towards one group or the other. The general belief was that any teacher who had chosen to work in an integrated school would not be employable in any other type of school in Northern Ireland. They believed that going to work in an integrated school was interpreted as &#65533;betrayal&#65533; by many other teachers in both the controlled and maintained sectors, and as a result they would not be &#65533;allowed back&#65533;. As a small scale case study we selected the area surrounding one of the integrated primary schools and arranged interviews with the principals of the nine other primary schools which serve the community. These included both controlled and maintained schools. The principals agreed to take part in a semi structured personal interview in which they were asked to comment on the general growth of integrated education and, more specifically, on the establishment of an integrated school in their community. From these interviews it became clear that there was hostility both to the general idea of integrated schools and to the establishment of an actual school in the area.</paragraph><paragraph parID="598">It was suggested that it was &#65533;unprofessional&#65533; for teachers to move into the integrated sector since the establishment of such a school would inevitably lead to falling roles for other schools in the area and hence the possibility of redundancy for &#65533;fellow professionals&#65533;. Integrated education was also thought to be &#65533;divisive&#65533; since it suggested that existing community relations in the area were not &#65533;good enough&#65533; and that the established schools did not co-operate with each other. The argument, therefore, was that the establishment of an integrated school, far from contributing to cross-community contact, could damage it. In addition there was particular resentment about the provisions of the 1989 Education Reform Order relating to integrated education and in particular to the funding of capital building projects to provide suitable facilities for integrated schools. These were interpreted as giving the integrated schools priority over other schools and hence an &#65533;unfair&#65533; advantage in terms of capital funding. The fact that the government was now showing interest in integrated education and taking the schools into account in formulating policy also gave rise to suspicion and the suggestion that the schools could be &#65533;used&#65533; as an agent of social policy. There was also misunderstanding and confusion about the level and form of public funding the schools receive, with a number of principals under the (erroneous) impression that minibus services provided to collect pupils for the integrated schools and the nursery units attached to many of them were paid for by DENI.</paragraph><paragraph parID="599">Only one of the principals had visited the new school, although most had been invited to special events such as the official opening: nor did they normally invite the principal or staff of the integrated school to functions held in their schools. However, the principal of the integrated school was not invited to these meetings. In such a climate the anxieties of the staff in the integrated schools about their careers seem to have some foundation. The controlled and maintained schools already form two distinct sectors with almost no staff interchange. There is a little cross community movement of teachers in the voluntary grammar schools, some Protestants work in Catholic grammar schools and vice versa, but the actual numbers are small. It would appear that, if the situation does not change over the next few years, the teachers in the integrated schools could become another separate sector. For the teachers there will be the additional problem that, if the schools remain relatively few and geographically scattered, it will be difficult to establish a clear career structure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="600">Concerns and anxieties about the future of the integrated school movement During the early phases of the development of the schools there were immediate worries for many of the teachers. The financial position of some of the schools had been very precarious on numerous occasions and the teachers suggested that there had been times when they wondered whether they would have a job next month or whether there would be a pay cheque at the end of the month. In retrospect they were philosophical and even amusing about the anxieties they had experienced, but it was very clear that the levels of stress which had been endured were very great and that even now the teachers feel less secure than those in other schools. The issue of employment outside the integrated schools touched on in the section on career structures was an obvious area of anxiety for the teachers although the extent of their worry varied. They had taken a conscious decision to move to an integrated school, but did not feel they would have to pay too high a price for their gesture. Even those who had gained promotion in coming to the integrated school felt that it was quite likely to be the last promotion they would ever have unless the integrated sector grew dramatically over the next few years or unless they were prepared to move outside Northern Ireland.</paragraph><paragraph parID="601">They did not foresee very rapid growth in the number of schools and the sheer economic and social problems of leaving Northern Ireland deterred most from considering that option. Some of them were, however, beginning to think about what it meant to be labelled as a &#65533;teacher in an integrated school&#65533;. The isolation of integrated schools Some of the teachers talked about links with other schools. Their interest probably arose from the concerns already discussed about career patterns and the security which work in an integrated school could offer. The issue they were interested in analysing was, whether the integrated schools should remain separate from the rest of the school system or whether there should be more efforts to establish contacts and interchanges. Some of the teachers were worried that the schools could become &#65533;exclusive&#65533; and just another separate group which would add to the divisions in the education system rather than reducing them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="602">They found this particularly distressing because they felt that they had learnt a great deal by working with members of the other community within the school. They also praised the opportunity for professional development which integrated education could provide &#65533;there are so many responsibilities to be undertaken .... teachers are constantly reassessing their work in the light of their aims ... all of this ought to stand someone in good stead in interviews in other schools&#65533;. This led some to the view that the contribution they might make to the overall school system in Northern Ireland would be more valuable if they did move back into the controlled or maintained sectors where they could share this learning. In any case as some pointed out, it was unlikely that they would want to teach in any other kind of school after this experience. Previous sections have dealt with the views and concerns of both parents and teachers separately, but central to the original objectives of those who founded the integrated schools was the relationship between the two. Partnership between parents and teachers is mentioned frequently in the literature of ACT, BELTIE and NICIE. So, from the outset, one of the main aims was to establish a quite different pattern of relations between parents and teachers and the early history of the schools has reinforced this distinct pattern.</paragraph><paragraph parID="603">During the period before the school opened to pupils the parents were actively working in the school building and taking many of the practical decisions. At this stage they felt that the school was &#65533;really ours&#65533;, but once the teaching began and more of the decisions became traditional educational ones, they felt less confident and experienced a sense of &#65533;losing the school&#65533;. One parent said, &#65533;It seems to be run much like other schools now. The role of parents has become normalised&#65533;. The teachers who had been involved since the school opened also expressed nostalgia, particularly about the first year of the school&#65533;s operation. At that stage schools were small and teachers felt that they were able to establish closer relationships with their pupils and their families than they had ever experienced in any other educational setting. With increasing numbers they felt this was slipping away.</paragraph><paragraph parID="604">The teachers also felt that there were problems about coming into a situation where parents had already made many decisions, both about the actual physical layout of the school and about the role which they wanted to play in the school&#65533;s future. At a purely practical level they sometimes found it disconcerting to be working with parents on painting classrooms on Saturday, socialising on a first name basis and with the parent as the expert; and then trying to establish a different set of relationships on Monday when the same parent came into the classroom to discuss their child&#65533;s progress in reading. One commented, &#65533;I don&#65533;t like them coming in during the day and calling me by my first name in front of the children&#65533;. In some cases teachers felt that they faced situations of divided loyalty since the demarcations between parents and teachers were no longer clear cut. One teacher said that sometimes colleagues expressed concern about forms of &#65533;parental interference&#65533; which she did not find threatening. But when she said that she did not think it was a problem, there was a danger of being accused of &#65533;siding with the parents&#65533;, and this could increase tension in situations where pressure of work was already putting everyone under stress. The schools had established structures at the beginning to try to regularise and formalise parental involvement and the relationship between parents and teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="605">But they had no models to guide them and even the definition of the relationship itself posed problems. The Parents&#65533; Council was established as the main forum where parents could meet on a regular basis to discuss any aspect of the running of the school. But the precise relationship between the teachers and the Parents&#65533; Council seemed unclear. In some cases teachers attended the Council as observers, whilst in others there was a formal report from the Council to the teachers. It seemed that the process of defining clear structures for close and productive parent teacher interaction, whether through the Parents&#65533; Councils or by some other mechanism, had not yet been fully successful. The Parents&#65533; Councils were set up as the central channel through which parents can air their views and formulate requests to the teaching staff. Ideally the Council should be the equivalent of a staff meeting and could be a valuable structure for formalising parental input into school policy and hence parent-teacher relationships.</paragraph><paragraph parID="606">In fact attendance by parents at council meetings was quite low in some instances and this was giving rise to concern. Some of the founder parents felt that the problem was that &#65533;newcomers did not understand the original aims&#65533; and so did not see how important the Council was. Meetings are left to the old stalwarts ... in this respect the school is just the same as any other place. There is nothing magical about it&#65533;. Others felt that the Council meetings did not address the central educational issues, &#65533;parents should be able to seek explanations from the teachers at meetings, for example about teaching methods, without anyone feeling embarrassed&#65533;. Other parents saw the meetings as too academic and not related closely enough to what was happening in the classroom, &#65533;they tend to go over my head&#65533;, or &#65533;sometimes I feel out of place&#65533;. At present the parents are not sure how to get involved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="607">One parent said, &#65533;Parents need active encouragement from staff to get involved&#65533;. The seeds of disillusionment could also be detected in some responses, such as the comment, &#65533;I was impressed in the early exciting heady days by what appeared to be on offer - the opportunity to help shape the curriculum ... this has not been followed through which is a pity because it had great potential&#65533;. At the same time teachers are not sure how to retain their professionalism whilst sharing responsibility and decision making. Sometimes they feel the parents are holding back &#65533;there is still much reticence on the part of the parents, they could get more out of their relationship with the school&#65533;. We felt both groups needed more time to think through the implications of their roles, to consider questions such as whether there is a role for parents in actually planning classroom activities and how much involvement teachers actually want. It is clear from the interview data that to talk about parent! teacher relationships as a unitary concept is an oversimplification.</paragraph><paragraph parID="608">Contact and interaction takes place at a number of levels and in a number of ways. At the first level there is the personal interaction of the individual parent with the individual teacher. This may differ little from what would occur in any school, except that it takes place against a background of a school philosophy which places parent / teacher relationships in a different context and therefore quite possibly produces different expectations on both sides. Then there is the level of the formal structured involvement of the two groups in policy making. This is much less familiar territory and there is clearly uncertainty amongst both parents and teachers about aims and procedures. On occasions we felt that some of the difficulties arose, not from disagreement between parents and teachers, but because either the teachers or the parents as a group, had not formulated an agreed position. Some teachers were much more ambivalent than others about, for example, parental contributions to curriculum development, and these differences made for uncertainty and suspicion when members of staff had to negotiate with parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="609">Amongst the parents there were even clearer contrasts. Many, possibly the majority at this stage, welcome involvement but see it primarily as a personal thing relating mainly to their interest in and commitment to their own child's education. They are satisfied that involvement works if they feel they can talk to teachers in a more relaxed and informal way than they had previously been accustomed to and can go to visit the school without feeling intimidated. A number of parents said they were now not &#65533;afraid&#65533; to approach staff. But there is also a group of parents who want to broaden the concept of involvement into a more general relationship with the school which goes beyond the education of their own children and affects the long term educational philosophy of the school. They seem to define parental involvement, not only as the personal interaction of parent and teacher over the education of the individual child, but as the exercise of influence over the management and running of the school as an institution, by parents as a group. This view seems to be held by many of the founder parents, and almost certainly results from their having had to take major decisions about the schools before any teaching staff were appointed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="610">They see a continuing major role for parents in determining the policy and curriculum of the school and express frustration with what they see as the &#65533;lack of vision&#65533; of some of the new parents. The evidence from this study is necessarily provisional but there are indications that the pattern of parent-teacher relations may currently be going in different ways in the primary and secondary schools. In the secondary schools on the other hand the parents seem to be much more unsure about their role. This contrast may also be linked to the more general way in which the level of a parent&#65533;s involvement in all aspects of their child&#65533;s life gradually becomes less close and direct as the child gets older. Often, too, by this stage, mothers who had given up work when their children were born, may have returned to employment and would be unable to undertake daytime activities to help the school. At primary level, especially when the child first enters school, the parents have a very direct sense of involvement (Farquhar,1986; Hannon,1986; Hannon,1990). They are likely to visit the school with the child, talk to the staff about the practicalities of the school day and then accompany and collect the child daily at least to begin with.</paragraph><paragraph parID="611">This regular direct contact, linked with the integrated school&#65533;s stated policy of building up a partnership between parents and teachers means that most of the parents do not feel intimidated by contact with the school. In addition they feel they know the child better than the teacher and thus have valid inputs into any discussion. There is also the issue of the professional status of primary teachers and the general estimation made of the skills they have to exercise and the level of specialist knowledge needed to present learning tasks to young children. Although many parents do appreciate the magnitude of this task, there is still some sense that because the academic level of the content presented is limited it &#65533;can&#65533;t be that difficult to do&#65533;. All of this, coupled with the natural anxiety parents feel over a child&#65533;s early progress in numeracy and literacy, creates a climate in which some parents at least are keen to take advantage of the chance to have a say about the curriculum and teaching methods. For the teachers this can very easily become threatening and led some of them to interpret what a parent sees as &#65533;interest&#65533; as &#65533;interference&#65533;. As a defence some were anxious to establish boundaries, both to the contexts in which issues could be raised and to the areas where parental input was legitimate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="612">In the secondary schools the balance seems to be rather different. Secondary school teaching, especially in grammar schools has traditionally had high status in Northern Ireland and this is reflected in the pattern of relationships emerging in the integrated secondary schools. By this stage the parents are still anxious to be informed but they are usually less sure of their competence to make direct inputs about teaching methods and content. So concern focuses on the need to ensure that children achieve success in external examinations as a way of gaining access to higher or further education, training or employment. The parents are just as concerned as at primary level but do not feel they know enough about syllabuses or examination structures to be able to contribute directly to the formulation of the curriculum. In this situation it is the parents who feel threatened and who need supportive structures to enable them to raise issues and ask questions without the fear of &#65533;looking foolish&#65533;. This section on the relationships between parents and teachers may seem to present a rather depressing picture.</paragraph><paragraph parID="613">But as the research progressed we came to see the current diversity as positive. We would now suggest that a period of some uncertainty is a part of the process of trying to establish new patterns in a situation where neither parents nor teachers has any relevant precedents. In each school the two groups are evolving from a relatively naive belief in co-operation over children&#65533;s education, to facing the reality of shifting attitudes and expectations. The hope is to generate a measure of practical co-operation, and this is likely to be a long process with each school probably developing a slightly different pattern. Out of the analysis of the parent and teacher interviews we have gained considerable insight into the attitudes and motivation of parents and teachers. In this final section of the report we want to reiterate and reinforce some of the general issues which seem crucial in understanding the development of the integrated schools to date and which are likely to have major implications for their future. Time and skill requirements</paragraph><paragraph parID="614">Throughout the study we have been conscious of the immense time inputs which teachers and parents have had to put into the development of the schools. The time demands were at their maximum during the initial phases of the establishment of each school but they continue to be heavy. They arise from two main sources, the fact that parents and teachers have had to undertake so many of the responsibilities which would normally fall to a local authority or government department and also from schools' central philosophy of consultation. This raises a number of questions which in the light of changes towards greater parental involvement and increased local management of all schools, have implications outside Northern Ireland (Halpin,1990; Howell,1990). A situation in which each individual school handles its own interactions with every outside agency does raise issues about efficiency. In the early stages it was probably inevitable that problems had to be tackled on an individual basis, but now the schools are beginning to think about possible structures which might enable them to co-ordinate some aspects of planning in order to cut down the volume of work for each set of governors, parents and teachers. On a very practical level can teachers, and especially teaching principals, be expected to undertake such a wide range of management tasks.</paragraph><paragraph parID="615">The teachers themselves expressed concern about the effect on the quality of their teaching of having to do this over long periods of time. In some cases there may even be a risk to the physical health of those involved. Although such things are hard to quantify, in both cases it does seem that stress was one of the major factors involved. Our evidence suggests that parents want to be involved in their children's education but that for most this does not imply a wish or even a willingness to be heavily committed to meetings on a regular basis. Commitment and motivation Up to now in the integrated schools these very heavy requirements for time and skill inputs from parents and teachers have been sustained out of the very strong commitment to the concept of integration. Almost all of those strongly connected with the schools are anxious to improve community relations in Northern Ireland and see work for the integrated schools as one practical way of contributing to this process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="616">For many in the core groups behind each school there is a strong link to their religious or political beliefs. Individual parents initiated the original meetings at which the idea of integrated education was discussed; in each locality groups of parents met in private houses and then set up the public meetings to gauge community support. So from the outset parents have been involved in a range of aspects of education with which they would not normally have any contact. The ongoing involvement of parents is also written into the constitution of each of the schools. The exact form varies, but in all there is parental input to all the bodies connected with the management of the school. There are parents amongst the trustees, parent governors and a parents&#65533; council. The parents&#65533; council is open to all parents and meets regularly to discuss finance, management, staffing and curriculum matters.</paragraph><paragraph parID="617">There are also sub-committees of the parent&#65533;s council and the governing body to deal with specific issues such as the religious education provision and curriculum. All of this means that parental involvement is institutionalised in a much more extensive and formal way than in most schools, and there is the potential for a much closer interaction between parents and teachers. The founding parents clearly intended that a new type of relationship should be established and one in which the balance of influence between the two groups would be tilted towards the parents. Both parents and teachers raised a number of issues which cause concern. The period of transition from the founding phase, during which the parents have very direct inputs, to the running phase, where the teachers move to a more central position, has been difficult for both groups. 'Our parents are really involved - if we've got stuff on out of school they're always invited.' Parents participate in debates and discussions about education, and use their own skills to contribute to school improvements.</paragraph><paragraph parID="618">Parent representatives are involved in school development groups, working parties and committees. They also represent the school's views in wider educational debates. A wide range of parents are involved in social and educational activities, in supporting trips and activities and in assisting the school in sharing its achievements at special events and concerts. Pupil Transformational Grid A school is good to the extent that... A school is excellent to the extent that...</paragraph><paragraph parID="619">It invites parents into the school to attend social activities, school shows and prize giving. Parents work with staff and pupils to raise funds for the school. It takes active steps to involve adult helpers in contributing to the life of the school. Some parents help the school promote effective partnerships with other parents and with employers. For example, they provide career/vocational role models for young people. Parents talk about their work, culture or lifestyle as part of the curriculum, and contribute to careers guidance. They offer opportunities for mock interviews and discussions about employability skills.</paragraph><paragraph parID="620">It offers some support to parents in developing their own skills and knowledge, particularly in relation to parenting and supporting their children's learning. Staff find out what parents want to know and co-ordinate information, events, classes and support groups for parents. The school enables groups of parents who have particular needs to support each other and their children. It brings together parents with specific needs and interests, working with partner agencies. They form support groups and forums which benefit both parents and their children, focusing on learning as well as common interests. (Macbeth, 1988). This is a more difficult level to sustain than the first, perhaps because the relevance is less apparent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="621">All Parents&#65533; Councils expressed anxiety about numbers of parents attending meetings. Business was repetitive and obsessed with trivia, such as endless discussions about uniform&#65533; or &#65533;they went round in circles and would have turned your head&#65533;. A founder parent put it this way &#65533;some parents found it easier to volunteer for specific tasks like cleaning and painting which are patently positive rather than the more vague format of sitting at meetings and talking. Why was this so? The one most often cited had to do with the perception that they lacked the expertise which they believed a governor would require. I would not feel qualified to take part in the actual running of the school. That should be left to professionals&#65533;, or &#65533;I would rather leave that kind of thing to those who can do it&#65533;.</paragraph><paragraph parID="622">Importantly, even given the strong parental representation on Boards of Governors, one parent still had misgivings, &#65533;I prefer to remain in the Parents&#65533; Council because there I am always with parents. This would not necessarily be the case with the Board of Governors or Directors, some of whom would not be parents&#65533;. An example of this came from one parent who had been made a governor to replace a parent who had not been able to complete their term in office. Beyond this stage, parental involvement comes to mean something rather different. Finding an acceptable role for themselves at this level would appear to be an ongoing process. They take part in the activities of parents Councils, act as teacher-helpers in the classroom, assist with transport on outings, raise funds for the school. The first meetings were often &#65533;off-putting and a waste of time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="623">There were a number of possible reasons for this small number, the most important being the strong element of personal contact. But if others believe that educating children in segregated schools is not in the long term conducive to community harmony, then they should have the option of settling for a school system which reflects this position. This sense of caution was also a reflection of the number of initiatives which have been tried over the years and which have fallen by the wayside. All this is clearly linked to why parents have chosen to send their children to integrated schools and an attempt is made to analyse this in the next section. If the integrated schools in Northern Ireland are to be viable in the long term, considerable numbers of parents have to choose to send their children there. Understanding the determinants of parental choice is, therefore, crucial in assessing the future of integrated schools. So trying to understand what factors parents take into account in selecting a school, and how they evaluate these different factors, was one of the central aims of this research.</paragraph><paragraph parID="624">Perhaps the most striking finding was the diversity of reasons given as the basis of choice. This was partially to ensure comparability and also because she built up a network of contacts which enabled parents and teachers to have confidence in her. A small number of trial interviews were carried out to establish the best conditions and format for respondents and to get some idea of the time needed. General background about the parent&#65533;s own family history, upbringing, schooling and employment. How the parent became aware of the integrated school movement. When, how and why they decided to become involved with integrated schooling. What made them actually decide to send their child or children to an integrated school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="625">What they hope will be the benefits of this decision for the child, for themselves and for the wider community. What aspects of the management, organisation and curriculum of the school they feel most concerned to be involved in, and why they regard these as legitimate areas of parental concern. General background about the teacher&#65533;s own family, upbringing, schooling and employment history. How they initially became aware of the integrated school movement and their initial reactions to it. Any other issues they want to raise about integrated schooling. On the basis of the trial interviews it was decided that the outline was appropriate but that it was necessary to allow considerable flexibility in the order in which questions and issues emerged or were raised. In a few cases the parents preferred to come to the integrated school for the interview and in these cases an office or the staff room was made available.</paragraph><paragraph parID="626">The teachers were all interviewed at school, in the staff room, in their classroom or in the school office. At this stage a certain amount of factual information about the integrated schools themselves seems necessary. This again raises questions both for the future development of the schools and for wider issues relating to parental involvement in education. At the same time the very strength of commitment of some of the pioneers of integrated education could itself be problematic. In the integrated schools the contribution of such individuals was crucial in the initial stages but it may now be posing some problems. This clearly echoes some of the debates currently surfacing in Britain about the place of religious education in multi-ethnic schools Another aspect of the impact of individuals with strong commitments and views is the tension between long term and short term policy making.</paragraph><paragraph parID="627">The integrated schools and official bodies The churches, the political parties and government agencies did little to help the original groups who campaigned for integrated education and in some cases put obstacles in their way. There has also been a problem for the 'establishment' institutions in that although they may disapprove of integrated schools it has been quite difficult to focus opposition. It is hard to object to parents' wish to influence their children's education or to condemn an organisation which has as one of its central aims the desire to improve community relations and end sectarian violence. This ambivalence is clearly seen in the attitude of the churches, particularly the Roman Catholic church, which on the one hand supports the right of parents to choose the appropriate education for their children but on the other seeks to ensure that all Catholic children are educated in Catholic schools. Throughout the development of the schools one of the strengths of the movement has been that it has been very difficult to 'tie' the integrated schools to any faction in the community conflict. A common way of defusing cross community movements and peace initiatives in Northern Ireland has been to try to link them to the political aspirations of one faction and hence to undermine their credibility with other elements in the community and destroy their effectiveness as reconciling agents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="628">This may have changed with the Education Reform Order, since this does give a measure of government support to integrated schools. This has clear advantages for the integrated school movement but it does alter their perceived position in the community. In many contexts this could simply be interpreted as government policy reflecting the wishes of the governed in the best traditions of democracy. But in a situation of civil unrest, such as exists in Northern Ireland, it can also be interpreted as government taking over and using an initiative for political ends. The structure of the integrated school 'movement' During its early phases integrated education developed in a very 'ad hoc' fashion. Groups of interested parents met in private homes to begin discussing the issues, planning campaigns for change and eventually organising the establishment of schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="629">ACT and BELTIE subsequently developed as umbrella organisations to try to co-ordinate the campaign for integrated schooling and exert pressure on government for support, but they have not developed a clear structure and policy nor can they claim to represent all the schools. The effective control on the opening of the next school has usually been the availability of finance, in the form of either grants or loans from the major foundations Both would like some central body through which negotiations could be carried on. NICIE would seem to be the natural organisation to take on this role but this is currently proving problematic for a number of reasons. Some of those early pioneers are averse to any suggestion that there is an integrated schools 'movement' for them there are just individual integrated schools which may have no more in common with one another than they have with any other schools in Northern Ireland. At the same time integrated schooling may well now have reached a stage where some thought will have to be given to the development of a medium term strategy for coordinated planning for the opening of new schools and the growth of existing ones. The wider issues tend to be seen through rather specific concerns.</paragraph><paragraph parID="630">The teachers see the growth in the number of schools as giving them more flexibility in terms of promotion and career development, whilst the parents are interested in seeing more schools open so that travel will be less of a problem and secondary schooling will be available outside Belfast. Alternatives to the present process of opening completely new schools also have to be considered in any future planning. The Education Reform Order sets out procedures through which existing schools can change their status to become integrated. In the present social and political climate of Northern Ireland such changes currently seem fraught with difficulty but it is conceivable that in the future they may be more acceptable. This would raise a whole new set of questions for the parents and teachers involved in the original integrated schools, as they would have to consider their relationship with a set of schools approaching integration with a completely different history and possibly totally different underlying aims and values. This raises the further question of whether in the long term the main contribution of integrated schools will be through the establishment of a new structure which will run in parallel with the two existing sets of schools or whether the main effect will be through subtly changing the educational climate and the relationships and expectations of both parents and teachers in the controlled and maintained schools. With this range of possibilities and the current uncertain but relatively open agenda, there is an urgent need for some more detailed analysis of the possible patterns which may emerge over the next 10 or 15 years.</paragraph><paragraph parID="631">If the integrated schools can develop an effective organisational structure, such an analysis might be one of its priorities but at present there does not seem to be a forum through which such questions can be addressed and this may have damaging consequences in the medium or long term. This research has tried to examine a social and educational phenomenon which is at a relatively early stage of development and which is changing rapidly. This means that we can only provide a snapshot of where the integrated schools were at a particular moment. During the two years of the project there were major changes, the provisions of the Education Reform Order and the introduction of the Common Curriculum altered the framework within which the schools operate, four new schools opened, new parents and teachers became involved with the schools and long established figures moved out. At the same time in retrospect we believe even more firmly than we did at the outset that it was essential to carry out an investigation at this stage. To have delayed in the interests of 'letting the situation settle' or 'letting the schools find their feet' would have meant that many of the formative early experiences of both teachers and parents would have been forgotten and lost. The central impression which comes out for us is one of complexity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="632">The phrase parental involvement' is used so often and so glibly in many educational contexts today, as if everyone knew what it entailed and as if its benefits were obvious. The reality is much more clouded. The potential is there, but both parents and teachers are struggling towards a definition of what they mean by and want from involvement. The study had both a specific contextual remit to examine the integrated schools in Northern Ireland and also a wider aim of illuminating the general area of parent-teacher interaction. Against this background the main conclusions are in two groups, those relating directly to the situation in Northern Ireland and those which are pertinent to integrated schools but also have implications for schools throughout the United kingdom. Specific Issues for the Integrated Schools In Northern Ireland It is clear that the integrated schooling sprang from a real grass-roots' initiative which had no links with any of the established religious or political factions in Northern Ireland.</paragraph><paragraph parID="633">There is uncertainty about whether the parents' councils are fulfilling their function of involving all parents and providing a clear channel for contact with staff. Liaison between the schools could be assisted if there was a forum which all the schools felt able to use to exchange experiences and co-ordinate future planning. Government agencies and the funding bodies are also putting on pressure for the establishment of a structure through which they can interact with the schools collectively. In all these areas structures are needed but there is a clear tension between the high levels of individual initiative characteristic of the founding period and the new demands for more corporate action. The outcomes are still very unclear but one danger is that if the parents and teachers themselves do not evolve structures they may be imposed from outside in formats which might well be at odds with the philosophy of those directly involved. (b) Moving from primary to secondary school The primary-secondary interface is a crucial area which is likely to affect the development of integrated education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="634">As an issue it is only just beginning to surface as it is only now that considerable numbers of children are reaching the end of an integrated primary education and their parents are having to decide where they should go for their secondary education. Outside Belfast this is a difficult and sometimes distressing experience for parents and children. The possibilities which must be considered include, the setting up of at least some integrated secondary schools outside Belfast. weekly boarding or negotiation with existing secondary schools to see whether some of them could make any specific provision for an intake of pupils from an integrated primary background. If some thought is not given to this transition it could be that anxiety about what is to happen when the child is 11 could be a factor which might deter some parents from using the schools. From a research perspective it would be very valuable if information could be collected about children leaving integrated primary schools who go into each of the secondary sectors - integrated, catholic, Protestant, grammar, intermediate and comprehensive. Such an investigation merits a research study in its own right.</paragraph><paragraph parID="635">(c) The career patterns of teachers The effect of teaching in an integrated school on the medium and long term career patterns of the teachers also needs to be analysed. Most of the teachers came from the segregated school sectors into the integrated schools but there is as yet little evidence that moves in the reverse direction will become common. If in the future teachers do move freely it could have a considerable effect on the whole profession but if the teachers in the integrated schools are isolated they may become frustrated and disillusioned. Again this is an area which should be monitored over the next few years. (d) Integrated education and parents in mixed marriages One group of parents for whom the schools have particular importance are those in 'mixed Roman Catholic/Protestant marriages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="636">When we began this research we knew that there was anecdotal evidence that many parents in mixed marriages were involved with the schools. As the study progressed the evidence clearly supported this view and it also became apparent what importance these parents attached to the availability of the schools. People in mixed marriages can feel isolated and vulnerable in a polarised society such as Northern Ireland. Support from their families may be at best qualified and many social contexts can be awkward. In the integrated school movement they seem to find a setting in which they are not only fully accepted but their particular experience is valued. A connection with the schools therefore seems to have a wider significance for this group and would be very valuable if a more detailed study could be made of in this area. At present there are studies of the demographic aspects of mixed marriages, their incidence, geographical distribution etc. but there is very little information about the social implications.</paragraph><paragraph parID="637">Our second set of conclusions raises a number of wider questions relating to parent - teacher interaction which we believe have significance for schools through out the United kingdom. The issues have been analysed in detail in the main sections of the report but to reiterate the central conclusions:- (a) There are considerable difficulties in sustaining parental involvement after the initial period of innovation. A new initiative generates enormous enthusiasm and commitment, individuals and groups are prepared to give very large amounts of time and expertise in order to achieve a clearly defined objective such as opening a school by a specific date. It is less easy to sustain on-going enthusiasm and interest in the running of an on-going institution. This appears to be true even when there is strong ideological and religious motivation as is the case with the integrated schools in Northern Ireland. In contexts where the issues are less emotive it may be even more difficult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="638">(b) The formation of actual or perceived cliques is very difficult to avoid. Such groups may well be seen by others as wielding power and influence and also as 'closed'. This perception of exclusiveness seems to be worrying since it may inhibit the process of ensuring that 'new' parents continually come forward to sustain an ongoing but evolving relationship between parents and teachers. (c) It seems clear that individuals or small groups with strong opinions can exert great influence. This can significantly affect school policy and have far reaching implications. The potential effects this could have if particular social, political or religious groups gained control of schools raises fundamental questions about society's views on the formulation and direction of educational policy. (d) The evolution of structures which allow a range of levels of interaction between and amongst parents and teachers without any group feeling under threat is crucial This covers mechanisms for strengthening individual parent teacher interactions, and provision of contexts in which discussion within the parent group and amongst the staff group can be facilitated as well as strengthened structures for the two groups to exchange views and co-operate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="639">(e) The general labels 'parental involvement' and 'parent-teacher co-operation' are oversimplified. Both processes are multi-layered and there is an urgent both to investigate these layers further and also try to support parents and teachers as they try to develop structures to make interaction at all levels more productive. This material is copyright of the Centre for the Study of Conflict and the author(s) and is included on the CAIN web site with the permission of the publisher. We are also grateful to ESRC for funding the work, and to the principals and staffs, and many of the parents, associated with the integrated schools of Northern Ireland. The Centre for the Study of Conflict in the University of Ulster was initially established to record and investigate all aspects of local social conflict. These covered aspects of the founding and management of the school; the involvement of teachers, parents and other groups (such as the churches) in their development; the evolution of the curriculum; and the effects of integrated education on the attitudes of the pupils. what aspects of the organisation and running of the schools parents feel most concerned to be involved in and why they regard these as legitimate areas of parental concern;</paragraph><paragraph parID="640">the reasons why teachers choose to move into the integrated school sector, including the relative importance of positive factors like the perceived attractiveness of the new schools, and negative factors like dissatisfaction with the types of schools in which they previously worked; This has meant that new factors, such as the impact of the provisions relating to integrated schools in the Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, had to be incorporated into the investigation and subsequently included in the report (DENI, 1988; DENI, 1990; HMSO, 1989). The final structure of the report represents an attempt to organise the data collected in a way which reflects what we believe are the central issues concerning the involvement and interaction of parents and teachers in the integrated schools. From the early days of the &#65533;troubles&#65533; in the late 1960&#65533;s questions had been asked about whether the segregated education system contributed in any way to community division. At a slightly later date more empirical data, relating to the actual levels of interaction between schools across the community divide, were collected and analysed in a series of studies based in the Centre for the Study of Conflict (Darby, 1977; Dunn, 1989a; Dunn &amp; MulIan, 1984; Dunn &amp; Smith, 1989; Smith &amp; Dunn, 1990). Out of this growing general awareness informal pressure began to be exerted by groups of parents who felt instinctively that separation must be damaging to their children. There was a sense of regret that they had not had the opportunity to mix or be &#65533;aware&#65533; during their own childhood and that they now saw this as a loss which their children might be able to avoid.</paragraph><paragraph parID="641">Precisely how this was to be achieved and how it would be possible to detect whether or not it was being achieved, they, in common with everyone else, found difficult to evaluate. There was also a feeling that it was very important that &#65533;staunch&#65533; Protestants and Roman Catholics were choosing to send their children to the schools. It seems that improved community relations and child centredness are both important for parents. Some parents place emphasis on one and some on the other, but most see both objectives as being furthered partially through the overt curriculum and partially through the hidden curriculum. This is an interesting perception, particularly in terms of LMS, of parent governors and the national curriculum. This was not seen as a problem since parents felt that pupils would be old enough to handle any problems that might arise, and also that the schools they would be going to would not be very sectarian, especially at sixth form level. Like some of the parents they felt that the separation of children was alien to the spirit of Christianity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="642">To an extent quite unfamiliar in most educational settings the schools have been &#65533;parent driven&#65533;. They had to find suitable buildings for a school, negotiate all the details of purchasing, finance and renovation and oversee all stages of preparation up to painting the walls and arranging the desks. It was often only at quite a late stage, perhaps only two or three months before the school opened, that the first teacher was appointed. This was usually the principal and he or she was appointed by a panel on which parents formed the majority. The principal and teachers during the first year or two of each school&#65533;s existence were employed by a trust which was in effect made up of parents. However, even when complex structures have been established, translating the new relationship into reality proves a complex and difficult process. In the primary schools the teachers seem to be on the defensive.</paragraph><paragraph parID="643">They are anxious that parents may be making too many inroads into areas which they see as their province. They seem to feel that they do not have the competence to make valid inputs into the decision making process. This is true especially with reference to classroom practice, and perhaps reflects the raised level of academic difficulty of the curriculum material. This remains an area where negotiation will be needed and individual integrated primary schools will have to evolve a pattern which respects the views of both groups. The curriculum is seen as a much more specialised area in which &#65533;expert&#65533; knowledge is needed. The secondary schools are also considerably larger than the primary schools, so there may be more practical difficulties about parents and teachers meeting and this in itself may necessitate more formal structures. The problem in the integrated secondary schools does not seem to be that parents will &#65533;interfere&#65533; but that, unless new patterns are firmly established, the reality of parental involvement may come to mean little more than the typical activities of a parent teacher group in any other school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="644">In two of the integrated schools there was a change of principal just at the start of the life of the research project. Similarly there must be uncertainty about whether large numbers of parents can be expected to input so much time and skill indefinitely. For more information on the research summarized in this digest, please contact the author at the address below . Adolescence is an intriguing stage of development filled with many physical, cognitive, social, and emotional changes. Because parent involvement has been shown to be a very important positive force in a child's life (Patrikakou, Weissberg, Redding &amp; Walberg, in press), one would expect that during such a critical and demanding phase the two most important environments in child development, home and school, would increase their collaboration. The opposite though is true: As children progress through school, parent involvement declines dramatically (Zill &amp; Nord, 1994). Several factors contribute to this paradoxical decline: the more complex structure of middle and high schools, the demanding curricula that can be intimidating to parents, and the fewer school outreach efforts to involve parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="645">Or, is this decline of parent involvement just an indication of an underlying decline of parent influence over adolescents? Data for this investigation were drawn from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS), an extensive longitudinal study, which has been constructed to follow a cohort of students from the eighth grade through high school, college, and into the workforce. The model consists of three blocks of influence: first, background factors such as gender and prior achievement, and parent involvement factors such as parent expectations and parent-child communication; second, the adolescent's perceptions of the parent involvement factors; and third, student characteristics such as time spent on homework and the student's own academic expectations. The model was tested using structural modeling, a statistical procedure which estimates both direct and indirect effects that different factors have on the outcome under investigation. Several of the parent involvement factors measured when the adolescents were in eighth grade had significant and lasting effects on the academic achievement in later grades in high school, as well as on post-secondary attainment. Some of the paths influencing both academic achievement in high school and post-secondary attainment involve parent expectations and include the following: The further in school parents believed their adolescents would go, the higher the adolescents' academic achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="646">Parent Expectations Perception of Parent Expectations  Student Expectations  Achievement The further in school parents believed their adolescents would go, the clearer the adolescents' perception of such expectations, the higher their own academic expectations, the higher their academic achievement. The further in school parents believed their adolescents would go, the clearer the adolescents' perception of such expectations, the more time they spent on homework, the higher their academic achievement. In agreement with findings from other studies (Catsambis, 2001), high educational expectations constitute a powerful way through which parents can encourage continuously the educational attainments of their adolescents in high school and beyond. Implications for Teacher Preparation and School Practice The long-lasting effects that parent involvement variables have on the academic achievement of adolescents and young adults indicate that parent involvement during high school and beyond still remains an important source of guidance and support for the developing individual. Often, both parents and school personnel misinterpret the adolescents' desire for autonomy as a developmental barrier to family involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="647">However, studies have indicated that such a desire for autonomy serves as a moderator of preferences for certain types of involvement over others, rather than as a barrier to any type of parent involvement (Xu, 2002). Secondary education students believe that they can do better at school if they know that their families are interested in their schoolwork and expect them to succeed, thus challenging the prevalent view that adolescents do not want their parents involved at all. Also, parent involvement should not be viewed and defined in too narrow terms, such as direct involvement in homework completion, because the increasingly complex demands of the high school curriculum would prohibit many parents from being involved in that way. However, findings reported in this digest indicate a strong form of parent involvement is expectations. Parents who hold high expectations for their teens, communicate them clearly and encourage their adolescents to work hard in order to attain them, can make a difference in students' success. Teacher Preparation in Family Involvement Robust teacher preparation for the schools of the 21st century should reflect the multitude of research findings pointing to the importance that parent involvement has in all stages of the educational process. However, only a few teacher preparation institutions have reported offering a course on family involvement, and even then as an elective.</paragraph><paragraph parID="648">Several institutions report having some topic-usually parent-teacher conferences-relevant to parent involvement integrated into another course (Chavkin, in press). Infused in some other course, or taught separately, preservice teachers should have a comprehensive picture of the many benefits of a broadly defined parent involvement, as well as be aware of key areas that can make them more effective when working with students and their families (Epstein, 2001; Shartrand, Weiss, Kreider &amp; Lopez, 1997). Especially making teachers who will teach in middle and high schools-where parent involvement is not an expected part of the educational process-aware of the influential effects of parent involvement is essential. For example, required courses about adolescent development should debunk long-standing myths and inform prospective middle and high school teachers of the power that parent involvement has to positively affect achievement. Empowered teachers will empower parents to be involved and expect more from their adolescents. Empowered parents can inspire their teens to do better at school and in life. School Practices and Family Engagement Sometimes we take things for granted or we consider them self-evident when we should not.</paragraph><paragraph parID="649">Many parents might be surprised to learn that research shows that they have a strong influence on their teenagers. Simply letting them know is an important first step. Among other things, schools can encourage parents to (a) keep open lines of communication with their teens by maintaining family time to discuss things and share common activities; (b) enforce consistent rules that help adolescents learn the relationship of independence and responsibility; and (c) show that education is important by encouraging homework and reading, knowing the student's teachers, and supporting post-secondary education planning. In addition to these general recommendations, it is important for schools to provide specific information and suggestions that are aligned with the broader curriculum framework and expand learning from the classroom to home and beyond. In order to further foster better communication between home and school, teachers should encourage parents to be aware of school policies and the curriculum. Letting parents know about the best ways to communicate with their teen's teachers will also promote communication as it lifts some of the confusion that the structural complexity of secondary schools creates. In addition to printed communications, there are many fora through which such information can be communicated or reinforced: parent mentoring programs (especially during times of transition to middle and then to high school), family resource centers, the school website, brown bag meetings, or parent-teacher meetings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="650">We should also recognize that school-initiated communication for specific students tends to take place when adolescents misbehave or face academic problems. It is critical to expand child-specific communication to include positive news. Such a strategy will foster a positive climate and make parents more involved and responsive to future school outreach. Parent involvement continues being a positive and powerful source of influence for the achievement of adolescents and young adults. By encouraging parents to be involved in developmentally appropriate ways, schools can maximize the benefits for all students by gaining an important ally in their effort not to leave children behind. A family involvement program can serve as a forum for discussion and a conduit for change. Based on information from ongoing family-involvement programs, it's important to keep in mind the following points:</paragraph><paragraph parID="651">Remember, there is no "one size fits all" answer to partnerships. Identify, with families, the strengths, interests and needs of families, students, and school staff and work from there. Set clear and measurable goals based on family and community input. Develop a variety of outreach mechanisms to inform families, businesses, and the community about family involvement policies and programs. These can include newsletters, flyers, personal contacts, slide shows, videotapes, local newspapers and cable TV, web sites, and public forums. Provide a varied menu of opportunities for participation geared to the diverse needs of families, including working families. Schedule programs and activities flexibly.</paragraph><paragraph parID="652">Recognize that effective family involvement takes many forms that may not necessarily require parents' presence at a workshop, meeting, or school. Ensure that families and students have complete information about the standards students are expected to meet, examples of student work that meets these standards, and understanding of how students will be assessed. For example, hold curriculum nights to feature the standards and exhibit student work. Provide workshops about the state's testing program, with a chance for parents to take the test. Ensure that families and students have access to information about nutrition and health care, after-school programs, and community service agencies. Recognize how a community's historic, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural resources can generate interest in family-community participation. Hire and train a family coordinator to act as a liaison between families and schools and to coordinate family activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="653">This coordinator should be bilingual as needed and sensitive to the needs of families and the community, including the non-English speaking community. Use creative forms of communication between educators and families that are personal, goal-oriented, and make optimal use of new communication technologies. One idea might be telephones in every classroom with voice-mail capacity. Find positive messages to send to all families about their child on at least once a month. In addition to parent-teacher conferences, offer regular opportunities for families to discuss their children's progress, raise concerns, and work as partners with school staff to solve problems that arise. To promote student success, create a support team for each student and include a family member. Make sure that family members acting as volunteers in the school have opportunities to help teachers in meaningful ways such as assisting with instructional tasks and administrative functions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="654">In addition to being tutors and classroom aides, family members might speak to students about their careers, explain customs from their cultural traditions, or demonstrate a special skill. Provide professional development opportunities for educators and families to enable them to work together effectively as partners in the educational process. Involve families in evaluating the effectiveness of family involvement programs and activities on a regular basis and use this information to improve them. A Compact for Learning : gives parents, educators and other interested members of a school community overall guidance and specific worksheets to identify their school's need and strategies for high achievement by all students and the compact or agreement that parents and educators can sign which describes how they will work together. While parents are mentioned over 300 times in various part of the No Child Left Behind act, this Action Brief will concentrate on Section 1118, Title I of the Act. It is the only section in the Act devoted solely to parental involvement, and if implemented effectively, provides the core elements that incorporate many of the other parental involvement provisions of NCLB. As you become familiar with NCLB through the various other PEN/NCPIE Action Briefs, you will find parental involvement roles defined throughout.</paragraph><paragraph parID="655">These are important for you to know as well, but Section 1118 provisions are the core around which all of the other parental involvement provisions revolved. More specifically, Section 1118 requires that every school district and every schools receiving Title I dollars must have a written parent involvement policy, as well as build school capacity to effectively implement the parent policy provisions. This policy must be developed jointly with, approved by, and distributed to parents of participating children and the local community. It must ensure that strong plans for parental involvement are in place in every Title I school, and should be designed to encourage and sustain active parental involvement. The policy is the "plan," and requires both parents and schools to write down procedures and elements believed to constitute the most effective partnership between the school and families. Since Section 1118 does not contain enforcement provisions (for instance, nothing happens to a school if it does not have a policy, follow the provisions of the law, or fails to implement the polices), school districts and schools often over look this provision, or fail to make it an educational priority. In that case, parents need to take the lead in assuring the development of an effective parental involvement policy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="656">This Action Brief will help you do just that by providing a review of Section 1118 and what the law requires. Did You Know... That parents must be consulted by their state in developing their Title I plan. The plan must indicate how each level of the school system in the state will support parental involvement, and how Title I parental involvement is coordinated with other programs under NCLB, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998, the Head Start Act, the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, and the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. That a school district does not qualify to receive Title I funds until it implements the parent involvement requirements found in Section 1118, but very few schools lose their funding if found to be in non-compliance with Section 1118 provisions. That every Title I school district and Title I school is required to have a written parent involvement policy develop jointly with, and approved by parents. That NCLB provides funds for Title 1 schools to use to help parents better understand standards, assessments, and report cards.</paragraph><paragraph parID="657">That Title 1 schools are responsible for holding meetings to discuss parent involvement policies, programs and activities with flexible hours designed to accommodate working parents. Parents must be involved in deciding how Title 1 funds are allotted for parent involvement programs and activities. That monies from Title 1 schools can be used to provide support to parents for transportation, childcare, or home visits, in cases where these things prevents a parent from becoming involved in their child's school. Defining Parental Involvement and Building School Capacity and Leadership Defining Parental Involvement For the first time in the history of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) the law contains a definition of parental involvement. This definition should guide the development and implementation of parental programs in your school and school district, but should not limit additional parental involvement initiatives that may exceed the NCLB definition. The carrying out of other activities such as those described in section 1118 of the ESEA" Section 9101(32).</paragraph><paragraph parID="658">Building the Capacity for Parental Involvement Section 1118 also requires that school districts work in cooperation with their Title I schools to build the capacity of parents and school staff for strong parental involvement, which in turn will improve academic achievement. This section recognizes that not all schools have the same experience, expertise, resources and training in building school-parent-community partnerships, and is designed to address those "capacity" needs. Do not overlook the importance of this provision: it is a key requirement for those school districts and schools that do not have the school structure, teacher or principal expertise, leadership, or understanding in how to develop effective school-family connections and partnerships. What the Law Says About School District Parent Involvement Policy Statements Every school district receiving Title 1 funds is REQUIRED to: Develop, for the school district at large, a written parent involvement policy jointly with parents, agreed on with parents, and distributed to parents and incorporated in the school district's Title I plan that it must submit to the state in order to qualify for Title I funding under section 1112*. Submit to the state at the time that the school district forwards it Title I plan, any comments of parents who find that in their view, the school district's Title I plan is not satisfactory.</paragraph><paragraph parID="659">Include parents in the development of the school district and individual school improvement plans. Conduct an annual evaluation and review of its parent involvement programs that involves parents in an organized, ongoing and timely way that will lead to the: Evaluation of the content and effectiveness of parental involvement policies, Assessment of their effectiveness at improving the academic quality of schools served under Title 1, Identification of barriers to increased participation in activities that are provided for parents paying close attention to parents who are economically disadvantaged, disabled, have limited English ability, with limited literacy, or are of any racial or ethnic minority background, and, Designing more effective strategies for parental involvement, based on the results obtained by the evaluation, which should lead to the revision of the current policy. Provide coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary to assist participating schools in planning and implementing effective parent involvement activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="660">Assist individual schools in building greater capacity and expertise in developing strong parent involvement programs. Coordinate and integrate parental involvement strategies under this part with the parental involvement strategies of other programs such as Head Start, Reading First, Even Start, Parents as Teachers, and other school programs. Reserve no less than 1% of its Title I allocation for the implementation of parent involvement programming, which includes the promotion of family literacy and parenting skills. However, if 1% of the agency allocation under the written policy for the fiscal year will be $5,000 or less, then no money is required to be reserved. Note: Section 1112 pertains to the requirement related to local school district development of Title 1 plans, which stipulates that parents must be consulted in the development of the plan Title I School Districts and Title I Schools are Jointly REQUIRED to Ensure Effective Involvement of Parents by: Supporting partnerships among each Title I school, parents, and the community to improve student academic achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="661">Providing assistance to parents of Title I children served by the school or local educational agency in helping them to understand such topics as: The state's academic content standards and state student academic achievement standards, State and local academic assessments, and How to monitor a child's progress and work with educators to improve the achievement of their children; Providing opportunities for full participation of parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities, and parents of migratory children, including information and school reports, to the extent practicable, that parents can understand.

If the SEA already has a plan, find out who represented the community and parents in its development. After it has been disseminated, find out if it meets the needs and concerns of the parents in your community. Ask the SEA to appoint local representatives to the state committee of practitioners. Organize a statewide effort, in conjunction with representatives from community service agencies and parents, to help the broader community understand the state's curriculum content standards, student performance standards, accountability and assessment system, and student achievement requirements.</paragraph><paragraph parID="666">Ask to see what criteria and what process the SEA will use to review district parent involvement policies, to determine whether LEA plans are adequate, and to enforce LEA parent involvement requirements. Determine what recourse is available should LEA noncompliance occur. Ask the LEA to consult with community-based leaders as it develops its Title I plan. Work with parents and school leaders to develop model district- and school-level parent involvement policies that can be used as guides for LEA compliance with NCLB requirements. Offer to provide the following services to SEAs and LEAs either on a voluntary or a contractual basis: Professional development training for teachers in working effectively with parents Training in ways that schools and parents can work together more effectively</paragraph><paragraph parID="667">Training and skill-building activities for parents, e.g., how to negotiate with schools when adopting parental involvement policies, how to monitor compliance with policies, how to understand and analyze achievement and report card data distributed by SEAs and LEAs, and how to use the data to increase student achievement.

Potential Challenges to Parent Involvement</paragraph><paragraph parID="668">Many parents face obstacles in becoming involved with their schools. In developing parent involvement programs, school, parent and community leaders need to take these barriers into consideration: Differing ideas among parents and teachers on what constitutes involvement, Language barriers Find out and suggest what types of technical assistance will be provided to schools that are having trouble implementing parent involvement practices. Find out how the state will use education technology and innovative approaches to foster parent involvement. ACTION OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENT LEADERS</paragraph><paragraph parID="669">This requirement allows parents to be at the table with school administrators and educators to help write a policy that addresses how every school, through partnership with parents, will promote the social , emotional , and academic growth of children . It should be specific and should articulate how parents will be assured adequate and meaningful involvement. Disseminate the plan to community members and parents. If there does not appear to be any assistance available, work with your LEA and other community agencies to develop them. Determine if your school has a meaningful parent involvement policy and if one exists, volunteer to become part of the team to help implement and evaluate it. If a policy does not exist, become an active participant in its development, implementation and evaluation. Make sure that the parents included in its development represent the school community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="670">Make sure the parental involvement policy includes a school improvement monitoring team that serves as a watchdog to ensure that the Title I strategies and activities in the school's Title I application are being implemented. Be sure to collaborate with and utilize the services and expertise of your state parent information resource center (www.pirc-info.net). Ask as many questions as you need to find out whether your district and school are doing what they say they will do to involve parents. Find out how Title 1 dollars are being used to support parent involvement and also find out if there is other money available to support parent involvement. The law requires that parents and school personnel write each parent involvement policy statement together . Parents are now required to be a part of the discussion about how schools will help all children meet the state's challenging content and student performance standards. This policy is the beginning of the formation of home-school partnerships and should address the full range of family and student needs that impact learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="671">Below are some actions steps and questions you can ask to ensure that your policy statement meets the needs of your community. Find out how the state plans to review LEA parental involvement policies to determine whether LEA plans are adequate. Find out what assistance the state is ready to provide to LEAs and schools having difficulty implementing parental involvement policies. Work with the LEA to educate parents about state curriculum content standards, student performance standards, accountability and assessment system, and student achievement requirements. Provide translators, if needed. Survey the families in the school community to assess their needs and expectations for parent programs that the policy can reflect. And then follow up to make sure these programs are implemented and effective.</paragraph><paragraph parID="672">The team should include community representatives and should meet with teachers and school staff on a periodic basis to identify areas of progress and need. Feed information back to parents and school staff. Find out what, if any, professional development activities are planned to strengthen the partnership between families and schools. Assist the administration or staff in determining the resources and programs available for such training. Ask the LEA to go beyond the NCLB parental involvement requirements and include the following options in their plans: A review committee, including parents and community representatives, to monitor LEA parental involvement plans and their implementation Approval criteria for LEA parental involvement policies; specific assistance to help parents, schools, and communities develop their programs and a complaint process parents can employ if the LEA does not comply with the law</paragraph><paragraph parID="673">A coalition of parent organizations representing a diverse cross section of the school district and the student community to work with the LEA in developing the parental involvement plan A model parental involvement policy to give schools and parents a guide for tailoring a policy suited to their needs Model parental involvement programs and practices; a parental needs assessment; professional development to help teachers and principles engage parents more effectively; LEA and school plans to evaluate the success of LEA and school policies A parent resource center at the district and school level to ensure that parents become full partners in their child's education PARENT INVOLVEMENT CHECKLIST Title I parents and community leaders must be attentive to their school and school district parent involvement policies, which should be aligned with Section 1118 of the NCLB law. This checklist nvolvement requiremis designed to serve as a tool to help you determine whether schools and school districts are on the right track when it comes to involving parents, in the way Section 1118 of NCLB requires.</paragraph><paragraph parID="674">TIPS FOR DEVELOPING A SCHOOL FAMILY INVOLVEMENT POLICY What is a Policy? A policy commits a school to certain goals and actions. A family involvement policy describes what effective partnership between the school and its families looks like, and lays out how and when that will happen, and who will do what. A vision statement that says what the school community believes about the importance of family-school partnership to high student achievement. Specific steps that the school and families will take to work as partners to improve achievement, such as a school-family compact, family learning activities, personal learning plans, and student support teams. Terms of engagement - such as times for parents to observe in classrooms, availability of interpreters and translation, principal office hours, opportunities for parent-teacher communication, and so on.</paragraph><paragraph parID="675">Information about standards and assessment, and how to monitor student progress. Who will be responsible for carrying out the policy, including school staff, parents, and community members. Resources, such as funding, space, equipment, and staff time and positions. The policy also needs to lay out how it will be developed, promoted and assessed: How parents, school staff, community members and students will be involved in developing and approving the policy. Guidelines for measuring whether the policy is working, such as increased parent involvement in school activities and improved student attendance. How parents, school staff, and community members will learn about what the policy says.</paragraph><paragraph parID="676">Steps to Develop a Policy Bring together an action team that represents the people who will carry out the policy, including parent leaders who reflect the diverse families in the school. Find out how families and school staff want to work together to improve achievement. What they are interested in doing and learning about? What supports do they need? Focus groups, surveys and interviews are good ways to do this. Revise the existing policy to respond to current needs and interests.</paragraph><paragraph parID="677">Focus on action - what needs to happen and when. What Should a Policy Cover? The research on family involvement and student achievement strongly suggests the following: A school that is family-friendly: warm, helpful, and welcoming to families of all backgrounds. Activities and programs for families that are clearly linked to improving achievement. (Checklist: How will they help families understand what their children are learning, what good work for their children's age and grade level looks like, and how to help their children at home?) Close, personal relationships between staff and families, through one-to-one and small group contact.</paragraph><paragraph parID="678">Information, workshops and other activities for families on how to help their children's learning, Bridging cultural differences, by understanding families home cultures, identifying their strengths and assets, making sure all have chances to contribute. Opportunities for families to volunteer or contribute both at home and at school. Building the capacity of teachers, parents, and other school staff to work together through training and professional development. Vision: Parents are their children's first and most important teachers. Research tells us that parent involvement makes a big difference. When schools welcome families, establish personal relationships among families and staff, help parents understand how the system works, and encourage family-staff collaboration to improve student achievement, students do better in school -- and the schools get better.</paragraph><paragraph parID="679">supporters of our school and of public education advocates for their own and other children, and To be fully family-friendly, our school will provide: Friendly signs welcome visitors and explain how to get around the building. Visitors and callers are greeted politely and right away and can get information easily. A comfortable family resource room is a place for parents to meet, and lends books, games, and educational information for families to use at home. Current student work is displayed throughout the building, so that visitors can understand the purpose of the work and the high standards it is to meet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="680">Programs and activities help families understand what their children are learning and promote high standards. Workshops, learning kits, and other activities show families how to help their children at home -- and respond to what families say they want to know about. The school reports to parents about student progress and how teachers, parents and community members can work together to make improvements. Bilingual speakers are available to help families. Teachers or advisors make personal contact with each family at least once a month. A family liaison helps teachers connect to families and bridge barriers of language and culture. The school is open and accessible - it is easy for parents to meet with the principal, talk to teachers and counselors, and bring up issues and concerns.</paragraph><paragraph parID="681">Parents develop school improvement projects and do action research - survey other families, observe in classrooms, review materials, and visit other schools and programs. Professional development for families and staff on how to work together productively Families learn how the school system works and how to be effective advocates for their children. Teachers learn about successful approaches to working with families of diverse cultural backgrounds. Families and staff can learn together how to collaborate to improve student achievement. The school reaches out to identify and draw in local community resources that can assist staff and families. This policy was developed by a committee of parents, teachers, support staff, and community members.</paragraph><paragraph parID="682">They conducted focus groups with families, staff and community members, and did a school climate survey to find out what was important to them. They drafted a policy and distributed it widely for comment. They revised the policy using the comments and had it ratified by the school council, the parent organization, and the faculty. The policy should be reviewed every year and updated or revised as needed using the process described above. Parents are notified of the meeting through notices in English and Spanish sent home with children as well as the PTO newsletter, the school marquee and public postings. The school parental involvement plan School-parent compacts</paragraph><paragraph parID="683">Offer a flexible number of meetings, such as meetings in the morning or evening. Our first meeting will be on Parenting Day, October 19 th . Involve parents, in an organized, ongoing, and timely way, in the planning, review, and improvement of programs under this part, including the planning, review, and improvement of the school parental involvement policy and the joint development of the school wide program plan. Parents are included on our school wide committee, which meets throughout the year to develop, as well as, modify our Title I plan. Parents are also asked to serve on a Parent Advisory Committee, which helps formulate our Parent Involvement Policy, school/parent compact, and plan activities for parents. Parents are informed of these meetings through the use of our weekly communication folder so that they may provide input. The Parent Involvement Policy is evaluated each year, and any necessary changes are made.</paragraph><paragraph parID="684">The policy was in need of revision due to new state requirements. In May, the plan was begun and was finished in November due to the transition of administration. The school parent compacts were also revised for this school year to comply with all requirements from the state. Parents had input on all of the above. Provide parents of participating children --- Timely information about programs under Title I A description and explanation of the curriculum in use at the school, the forms of academic assessment used to measure student progress, and the proficiency levels students are expected to meet.</paragraph><paragraph parID="685">If requested by parents, opportunities for regular meetings to formulate suggestions and to participate, as appropriate, in decisions relating to the education of their children, and respond to any such suggestions as soon as practicably possible. Parents are informed of our school wide status, our AYP status, and what measures were used to compute AYP. Our school wide goals and curriculum used to implement these goals are reviewed with parents. Parents of students receiving intervention will be brought in for conferences and meetings so that everyone may have input on how best to help the child meet the state&#65533;s standards. If the school wide program plan is not satisfactory to the parents of participating children, submit any parent comments on the plan when the school makes the plan available to the local educational agency. If parents do not find the school wide program to be satisfactory, they may first contact the parent representatives on the committee so that their concerns may be brought before the committee during the planning phase. Parents are notified of the planning phase through Wednesday folders.</paragraph><paragraph parID="686">Parents may review the school wide plan at any time. If, after the school wide plan is written, parents may submit written comments to the principal, who will then submit these concerns to the Central Office Title I Supervisor. Develop with parents for all children served under this part a school-parent compact that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share the responsibility for improved student academic achievement and the means by which the school and parents will build and develop a partnership to help children achieve the State&#65533;s high standards. Parents and teachers were involved in the planning of the compacts for the 2006-07 year. Each parent receives a list of the standards that will be covered throughout the year in all grade levels. If parents have questions or concerns, they may contact their child&#65533;s teacher and set up a conference to discuss their concerns. After the general session, parents return to their child&#65533;s classroom for specific information on what assessment (reading, math, English) will be used to monitor progress throughout the year, how the assessments will be administered, and how to interpret the results.</paragraph><paragraph parID="687">Teachers give parents strategies on how to best help their child at home. Provide materials and training to help parents to work with their children to improve their children&#65533;s achievement, such as literacy training and using technology, as appropriate, to foster parental involvement. Montevallo holds literacy nights where kindergarten parents are trained on reading and writing with their child. An interpreter will be available to assist Spanish speaking parents. Parents of second grade students will be offered intensive instruction in the area of mathematics. Students and teachers will present this information to our parents. Childcare is provided also.</paragraph><paragraph parID="688">Parent Project night is held in spring for grades 3 &#65533; 5. Students, together with their parents, have access to the computers, resource materials and poster boards needed to begin their science/social studies projects. Various topics are discussed at the PTO/Parent Brunches quarterly. Parents of ELL students are invited to a meeting for their specific needs. Guest speakers are provided, as well as translators. All teachers at Montevallo Elementary are aware of the importance of parental involvement. The environment is friendly and inviting so that parents feel welcome when they arrive.</paragraph><paragraph parID="689">New teachers are trained on how to work with parents at New Teacher Orientation. The training focus on building and maintaining ties with parents so they are made to feel as equal partners in the educational process. If parents do not speak English, our school will find staff available that can communicate in their language so that they will feel welcome. To the extent feasible and appropriate, coordinate and integrate parent involvement programs and activities with Head Start, Reading First, Early Reading First, Even Start, the Home Instruction Programs for Preschool Youngsters, the Parents as Teachers Program, and public preschool and other programs, and conduct other activities, such as parent resource centers, that encourage and support parents in more fully participating in the education of their children. Montevallo has both a Head Start and Eclipse preschool program. Eclipse is actually housed in the building. These students&#65533; parents are invited to participate in all activities that other parents have access to.</paragraph><paragraph parID="690">Ensure that information related to school and parent programs, meetings, and other activities is sent to the parents of participating children in a format and, to the extent practicable, in a language the parents can understand. Information, parent notices, etc. is sent to parents of these children in Spanish. A community meeting is held each year specifically for these parents. Childcare is provided as well for these meetings. In addition, we have one bilingual teacher who assists with these meetings and in verbally communicating with these parents as needed. Our ELL committee meets with each child&#65533;s parents individually to discuss student achievement, test scores, and to formulate a plan tailored specifically for their child. At MES, we value parents as partners in education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="691">We survey parents to determine needs and plan activities accordingly. Last year, surveys indicated that many parents did not have use of a computer or Internet at home so the main form of communication with parents is still through weekly folders and phone calls. Parents were given a magnet at the beginning of school noting important dates to put on their refrigerator. To the extent practicable, provide full opportunities for the participation of parents with limited English proficiency, parents with disabilities, and parents of migratory children. At MES, we provide notices and all other documents in a language the parents can understand to the extent practical. Our bilingual teacher is available to assist in verbal communication with these parents as necessary. We have a fulltime License Practical Nurse and a Sign Language Instructor.</paragraph><paragraph parID="692">She assists one student with a speech and hearing impairment. A wheelchair is assessable for those needed student and faculty members as needed. Within reason, we comply with requests from parents that need special accommodations.

At the same time, the increase in academic demands and the complexity of the school structure make the task of academic success for adolescents even more difficult. This digest will explore paths by which parental involvement impacts achievement in high school and beyond.</paragraph><paragraph parID="693">The first wave of data were collected in 1988 when participants were in eighth grade and they have been resurveyed four times (in 1990, 1992, 1994, and 2000). The model used to explore parent involvement influences was constructed using theoretical and empirical elements in the broader area of parent influences and academic success. The two primary outcomes tested were academic achievement in high school (measured by standardized scores) and post-secondary attainment (measured by a 6-point scale ranging from some post-secondary education but no degree attained to Ph.D. or a professional degree attained ). Parent Expectations Achievement Parent Expectations Perception of Parent Expectations  Time Spent on Homework  Achievement Research states that children are more successful in school when parents are involved in their children's education. Our goal is to continue to strengthen communication between school staff and parents to improve students' academic achievement; build capacity for increased parental involvement; and provide opportunities for parents to become involved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="694">The Title I LEA-level parental involvement policy is developed jointly with Title I parents, agreed on by the Title I parents, and distributed to Title I parents. It describes how the LEA: 1) involves parents in the joint development of the LEA plan and in the process of school review and improvement; 2) provides coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary for effective parental involvement at schools to improve student achievement and school performance; 3) builds school and parent capacity for strong parental involvement; 4) coordinates and integrates Title I, Part A parental involvement strategies with parental involvement strategies of other programs; 5) conducts, with the involvement of parents, an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of the parental involvement policy;</paragraph><paragraph parID="695">6) involves parents in activities of schools served by Title I. The LEA conducts, with the involvement of Title I parents, an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of the Title I LEA-level parental involvement policy in improving the academic quality of Title I schools. This is achieved through the Annual Parent Planning Night which is usually held in October.

To learn more about the research summarized in this digest, please contact the author ar the address below . Parent involvement is linked to children's school readiness. Research shows that greater parent involvement in children's learning positively affects the child's school performance, including higher academic achievement (McNeal, 1999; Scribner, Young, &amp; Pedroza, 1999; Sui-Chu &amp; Willms, 1996; Trusty, 1998; Yan &amp; Lin, 2002) and greater social and emotional development (Bredekamp &amp; Copple, 1997; Fantuzzo &amp; McWayne, 2002). Simple interactions, such as reading to young children, may lead to greater reading knowledge and skills (Snow, Burns, &amp; Griffin, 1998). And, children with richer home literacy environments demonstrate higher levels of reading knowledge and skills at kindergarten entry (Nord, Lennon, Liu, &amp; Chandler, 2000).</paragraph><paragraph parID="697">Parent involvement outside of home, such as participation in extracurricular activities (e.g., concerts, sports, scouts), relates to their reading, general knowledge, and mathematics knowledge and skills (Reaney, Denton, &amp; West, 2002). However, more information is needed to examine what specific types of parent involvement are related to kindergartners' early literacy and how the relationship varies for children from diverse backgrounds. The purpose of the study is to contribute to an increased understanding of the relationship between different practices of parent involvement and kindergarten children's early literacy. &#185; The ECLS-K data include items that represent the components of school, family, and community connections, and therefore is appropriate to answer questions in this study. The dependent variables are children's early literacy skills-reading, math, and general knowledge achievement at the end of the kindergarten year. The independent variables, made up of five parent involvement composites, are grouped into three dimensions: (1) involvement at home, including home literacy environment and home cognitive stimulation; (2) involvement at school; and (3) involvement outside of the home, including extracurricular activities and use of community resources. A series of Ordinary Least Squares Regressions were conducted to examine the relationship between the parent involvement practices of 16,083 first-time kindergartners and early literacy, while controlling for background variables such as child gender, family SES, and family type.</paragraph><paragraph parID="698">Among the five parent involvement composites, school involvement was significantly associated with early literacy (reading, math, and general knowledge) for almost all children (except for Asian children's reading achievement). Next were home resources, which predicted almost all kindergartners' early literacy skills, except for Asian children's reading and math. The third was extracurricular activities, which were positively associated with the early literacy achievement for whites, Hispanics, and above-poverty-level children, and for the achievement of Asian children in reading and math; however, it was not significant for African-American and low-income children in early literacy, and for Asian children in math. The most important finding is that, among all the parent involvement practices, the percentage of variance explained was greater for minority children than for European-American children and for poor children than for the non-poor children. Although educational resources at home were highly circumscribed in both low-income and minority (especially black and Hispanic) families, the good news is that a stronger relationship was found among school involvement, home resources, and early literacy for these children. The findings support the literature that a positive working relationship between home and school appears important for all children, particularly for children whose families are socially or economically disadvantaged (e.g., Comer &amp; Haynes, 1991; Dauber &amp; Epstein, 1993; Nord, Lennon, Liu, &amp; Chandler, 2000; Reaney, Denton, &amp; West, 2002). Implications for Preservice and In-Service Teachers</paragraph><paragraph parID="699">The above findings suggest that training and practice need to focus on creating school involvement opportunities and an awareness of the impact of home resources, extracurricular activities, and ethnicity on parent involvement and child outcomes. Because home-school involvement is important for young children, particularly for children from disadvantaged families, teacher education programs should promote preservice teachers' awareness of the bidirectional interactions of home-school partnership. In-service teachers also may benefit from training that focuses on reflective practice. Communities can contribute to home-school partnership by promoting awareness of parent involvement in school and supporting school efforts to reach families. Linkages between community resources and schools can also be strengthened to create continuity across the informal and formal learning environments of children through extracurricular activities. This research presents preliminary evidence that parents' involvement at school, particularly among children from socially or economically disadvantaged families, may be related to their higher literacy skills at the end of the kindergarten year. The study suggests that educators work with parents to organize opportunities for their involvement in school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="700">In this process, educators are wise to understand parents' needs and views of education, and to reflect on their own motivation and desired outcomes for home-school initiatives. &#185; This is an ongoing national data collection effort by the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Beginning in the fall of 1998, 22,000 kindergartners were sampled to participate in the study and are being followed through spring fifth grade (spring 2005). Guided by an ecological perspective, the study provides detailed information on children's early school experiences, in which the child's physical, cognitive and socio-emotional development is considered across multiple contexts, including the home, classroom, school, and community. Two research questions guided the study: What types of parenting practices are related to children's early literacy in reading, math, and general knowledge performance at the end of the kindergarten year? How does the relationship between parent involvement and early literacy vary for children from different racial/ethnic and income backgrounds? Data for this study came from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999.</paragraph><paragraph parID="701">Parent involvement in schools: An ecological approach.

As a Boston Pilot School, BAA has autonomy over its budget, governance, curriculum and assessment, staffing, and schedule. Boston Arts Academy was chosen as a case study school because it enrolls a diverse population. Of the 381 students enrolled in 2002-2003, there were 50% African-American students, 24% White students, 25% Latino students, and 1% Asian students; and 56% were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. This case study of parent involvement focused on the following question: What has made Boston Arts Academy successful in engaging a majority of parents who have varied prior school experiences and levels of engagement?</paragraph><paragraph parID="702">In separate interviews, we talked with 24 of the 26 students whose parents we interviewed. We also interviewed three teachers, three staff members, and one administrator. We observed 10 parent/family events over 2 school years at BAA, including orientation, parent council meetings, student assessments, and performances. The Vision of Parent Involvement at BAA Parents have been an integral part of the BAA community since the school opened in 1998. There is little difference between the rates at which parents in either group are involved at the school in terms of events related to student work. Examples of these types of activities include serving as a room parent, participating in the Parent Council Board, and volunteering to provide support at performances and exhibitions. High-involvement parents were more likely than medium-involvement parents to participate in activities not directly related to student work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="703">Although BAA's Pilot status provides unique advantages for implementing a parent engagement strategy, other schools may learn from the model, even if they do not have autonomy or are not small. Ask any parent around and most will agree that being involved in your child's school is important and can make a difference in your child's academic and social success. Too often, however, the involvement ends up being one-sided - with moms tending to know more about what is going on at school. Both stay-at-home dads and career dads are getting involved; as a result, there is also an increased awareness about the powerful, positive impact dads can make. Whether your home is a two-parent home or you live apart from your child, your interest, enthusiasm and involvement with your child's education is important. Research shows that children of involved fathers are more likely to enjoy school, have better grades and more positive peer relationships, have fewer behavior problems, and become more responsible adults. When you are involved with your child's education, you send your child an essential message - school is important.</paragraph><paragraph parID="704">It is not only the kids who benefit from their dad's involvement. Research also finds that men who are involved fathers feel more self confident and effective as parents, find parenting more satisfying, and feel more intrinsically important to their children. Obviously, the time you need to be at work can place limitations on how you can get involved at school, but with creative planning you can be a dad involved and interested in your child's educational life. By doing this you also get to know who your child's peers and friends are, making it less likely that your child will get picked on or bullied. You get to know your child's teacher, making communication of issues much more likely and more frequent. All great benefits! 10 Simple Ways to Get Involved</paragraph><paragraph parID="705">Below is a list of simple ways for dads to volunteer and get involved at school: Volunteer to drive or chaperone during field trips. Coordinate a time with the teacher to read to the class or be involved with class projects or unit studies. Together with your child, prepare snacks for special class celebrations. If you aren't one for the kitchen, you can sign up to bring drinks or paper products. Plan an outing with your child to purchase the items. Set up or clean up after a class party.</paragraph><paragraph parID="706">Come in and have lunch with your child once a month or however often you can swing it. Drive your child to school or pick him/her up after school. Join a PTA committee. If you're handy with the computer, volunteer to set up a class website. Don't forget that being involved with your child's education includes providing support at home - help your child set up a good homework area that is free of distractions, review homework, help your child prep for an upcoming test, call out spelling words, read and respond to paperwork that the teacher sends home, etc. Fathers can make a positive impact in their child's educational experience. Families' involvement in children's education takes a variety of forms, including involvement in the home (e.g., help with homework), involvement in the school (e.g., attending open houses), parent-teacher communication, and parent-to-parent communication.</paragraph><paragraph parID="707">Reviews of family involvement research indicate that, on average, children whose families are more involved display higher levels of achievement than children whose families are less involved (e.g., Jeynes, 2005). Most family involvement research, however, has been based on comparisons between children whose families display high levels of involvement versus those whose families display low levels of involvement. There exists little research looking at changes within families to determine if increases in involvement are associated with improvements in child achievement. Moreover, until recently, we have known very little about the developmental consequences of family involvement for low-income children-the very children who are at exceptional risk of developing academic problems and who are often the focus of public policy aimed at increasing family educational involvement (e.g., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2005). With these limitations in mind, our team has been investigating longitudinal associations between family educational involvement and low-income children's development during elementary school. In this digest, we provide an overview of findings from our most recent study (Dearing, Kreider, Simpkins, &amp; Weiss, 2006), in which we examined associations between changes in family educational involvement in their children's schools and changes in literacy achievement between kindergarten and fifth grade for approximately 300 low-income families and their children. We were particularly interested in activities in which families participated within their children's schools-such as attending open houses, parent-teacher conferences, and other school organization meetings, as well as visiting and volunteering in the classroom.</paragraph><paragraph parID="708">We believe that two primary findings from this study have important implications for educational policy and practice: Increases in family involvement in the school predict increases in literacy achievement . Between kindergarten and fifth grade, increases in family involvement were associated with improvements in low-income children's literacy achievement. In other words, if families who were initially uninvolved in the school became more involved, their children's literacy improved. Importantly, our results indicate that even one or two additional involvement activities per year were associated with meaningful improvements for children. We found that increased family involvement in school had greater implications for children's literacy than did family income, maternal level of education, or child ethnicity. Family involvement in school matters most for children at greatest risk .</paragraph><paragraph parID="709">Between kindergarten and fifth grade, high levels of family involvement were most strongly and positively associated with the literacy achievement of children whose families were low-income and whose mothers had very low levels of education. For children with the exceptional risk of having low income and low parent education, there were exceptional achievement rewards associated with high family involvement. Although there was an achievement gap in average literacy performance between children of more and less educated mothers when family involvement levels were low, this gap was nonexistent when family involvement levels were high. Recommendations for Practice Our results support the usefulness of family involvement in schools as a means of improving the achievement of children living in low-income families, especially those who face the additional challenge of low parent education. In light of our findings, we recommend that schools view family involvement over the long term, ideally creating an educational environment that increases the involvement of families who are less involved and that helps sustain that involvement across elementary school. Our Study</paragraph><paragraph parID="710">We recommend that practitioners also consider research indicating that increases in family involvement are most likely to occur among lower-income families when schools not only reach out to families and invite them to become involved, but also when schools help these families overcome barriers to involvement such as child care and transportation needs (for a review, see Henderson &amp; Mapp, 2002). Although this is a tall order, our study adds to an increasing body of evidence that family educational involvement is vital for promoting the life chances of low-income children and provides exceptional benefits for the very same low-income children who face exceptional challenges. Telpochcalli, a small school of 250 students located in a poor, predominantly Mexican neighborhood of Chicago, developed as a bilingual, biliterate community school with an emphasis on Mexican arts and culture. First, it examined the impact of PWTW on individual workshop participants as well as on their relationships to their families, school, and community, and more generally on family-school relations. The research focused in particular on the interrelated ideologies of gender, ethnicity, and class in these processes. At the time of this report we have begun to analyze the data and produce an evaluation report. The following research findings are based on preliminary analysis of data collected over the past two years:</paragraph><paragraph parID="711">The writing workshop directly affects participants' self-perceptions and identities. Over time they come to see themselves as thinkers, writers, artists, and community leaders, and to incorporate these roles into their identities as mothers. Given that the participants had previously viewed the social role of motherhood in narrow and culturally conventional terms, this development is quite profound and has lifelong implications for themselves and their children. Although the workshop method contributes to these changes in the women's self-understanding in and of itself, it is clear that the publication and dissemination of the writers' work in the magazine Real Conditions , and the continual flow of stories and praise about the magazine that comes back to the writers from the community and beyond is equally crucial to this process. Just as the writers come to see themselves in new ways, so do their family members, other parents, and teachers at the school. This dynamic can be exciting, but also challenging. For instance, where some of the women writers' spouses admire their wives' literary activity and have asked to have their stories included as well, others disparage the activity as a waste of time, and others challenge their wives' increased extra-domestic activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="712">The children develop a greater interest in reading and writing, as they witness their parents do their own writing. Extensive and creative use of the magazine by teachers at various grade levels motivates students to write stories about their own lives, and increases their pride and interest in their family histories and cultural heritage. Participants have begun to examine prevailing views about parent involvement in education, and develop a range of critical perspectives and responses. Audiotapes and workshop notes suggest a relationship between various social and subjective factors, including: participants' increased confidence in the value of their writing and the stories they share in the group (and thus about their lives and knowledge), their contribution to group discussion as well as the workshop process, their involvement in their children's literacy and other school activities, and their inclination to explore additional classes and take on leadership roles in the school and community. The success of PWTW cannot be attributed exclusively to the writing program. In the case of PWTW, this includes the organizational support TCEP provides by: directing parent participants toward the writing project; drawing on the writers' work, enthusiasm, leadership, and communicative skills to encourage their participation in other school-community related efforts; and using the magazine as a cultural artifact when representing the school and its residents to other parents, schools, and (mostly immigrant) communities. The writing project has enhanced teacher-parent relationships and understanding.</paragraph><paragraph parID="713">Also, teachers have indicated that reading the parents' stories has given them a greater understanding of the backgrounds of their students' families, and insights into the social and economic issues the parents confront on a daily basis. Next year we will initiate a "parent-teacher writing collaborative" because many teachers have expressed an interest in participating in a parallel writing group for teachers. Implications for Professional Development and School Practice The contribution of Telpochcalli School and TCEP to the success of PWTW suggests that parent programs, no matter how well designed, cannot succeed by themselves, but must be located in a wider school and community context that supports and is consistent with the goals of that program. Research findings on teachers' responses to the writing program have several implications. One implication is that the writing workshop method used by PWTW may be adapted to a range of school settings. For instance, it may be adapted by teachers for classroom use as a way to develop student writing, foster a sense of community among students, and engage students in creatively exploring and writing from their experiences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="714">The findings also attest to the importance of fostering teacher-parent-community understanding. Although integrating teachers and parents into a single program might be challenging, in poor and immigrant schools, where there are often wide cultural and class disparities between teachers and parents, programs offering parallel parent-teacher programs can go a long way toward fostering communication between those two groups, while supporting parents' role in their children's educational community. Research findings offer a critical contribution to the literature on culturally relevant pedagogy and lesson content. They suggest that there may be an educationally meaningful distinction between curriculum and teaching materials that refer to the students' culture or cultural background in a generic sense, and curriculum and materials (such as a magazine of parent writings) that draw on concrete stories, traditions, knowledge, and experiences of people who are identifiable to the students. That these individuals are also adults and have a leadership role in the community is another quality that imbues such material with meaning, import, and motivation to the students. This research was supported by a Spencer Foundation small grant and by a Faculty Scholarship from the University of Illinois at Chicago's Great Cities Institute. Critical Issue: Creating the School Climate and Structures to Support Parent and Family Involvement</paragraph><paragraph parID="715">ISSUE: Evidence shows a strong connection between parent and family involvement in schools and children's academic achievement, attendance, attitude, and continued education (Henderson &amp;amp; Berla, 1994; Hickman, 1996). But families may not become involved if they do not feel that the school climate --the social and educational atmosphere of a school--is one that makes families feel welcomed, respected, trusted, heard, and needed. Research (e.g., Comer &amp;amp; Haynes, 1992; Epstein &amp;amp; Dauber, 1993) suggests a connection between the school climate and the extent to which parents and families are involved in their children's education. When schools create a positive school climate by reaching out to families and providing structures for them to become involved, the result is effective school-family partnerships . Frequent and positive school-to-home communication (in the form of phone calls, progress reports, conferences, personal notes, newsletters, and home visits) helps parents feel more self-confident, more comfortable with the school, and more likely to become involved. The Center on Families, Communities, Schools, and Children's Learning (1994) reports that parents are more likely to participate in schools if they receive information from teachers about classroom activities, the progress of their children, and how to work with their children at home. Epstein (1995) points out that the involvement of families in schools leads to overlapping spheres of influence between the home, school, and community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="716">Thinking of the school as an extended family can help to create a positive school climate. Even the simple use of language --such as saying "children" instead of "students"--can make a difference in making families feel welcomed and accepted in the school. Educators also contribute to a school's positive climate when they demonstrate openness, enthusiasm, and understanding toward all students, and when they show respect for parent diversity . Epstein (1995) points out the need for teachers and schools to increase their understanding and respect for student and family diversity, creating a more caring school climate. Letting parents know that they are valued and acknowledging their time constraints and familial obligations are other key elements of school climates that are conducive to family involvement. Interviews with educators (Nathan &amp; Radcliffe, 1994) indicate that educators recognize the importance of improving skills needed to work effectively with parents and families . Educators who are skilled in working with families can make a significant contribution to the positive climate of a school and the development of partnerships with families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="717">To formalize their commitment to accepting mutual responsibility for children's learning, some schools and families have developed a family-school compact for learning . Such compacts or agreements affirm the importance of school-family partnerships by defining goals, expectations, and responsibilities of schools and families in educating children. Bonds between families and schools also can be forged or solidified if ways are found to involve families directly in the ongoing work of the schools. Comer (1988) describes structures for involvement --parent participation on governance and management teams, as classroom assistants, and as organizers of school events--used to increase parent participation and promote positive interaction between families and schools. Davies (1991) suggests three ways that schools can promote parent involvement : establishment of a parent center, a home visitor program, and action research teams that examine methods for involving parents. Exceptional parent-involvement programs use these and other structures to develop two-way communication between school and home, and to involve parents in decision making, planning, assessment, and curriculum development. By creating a climate in which parents and families are regarded as partners in learning , schools can make parent and family involvement a reality.</paragraph><paragraph parID="718">The school climate is conducive to involving parents and families in their children's education. Teachers and administrators understand the importance of a positive school climate in relation to family involvement. Teachers and administrators know how to create a positive school climate and are consistent in their approach. Family members feel welcome in the school. They know that they are valued and supported in their efforts to become more involved. Break down barriers and establish trust by reaching out to families through home visits, having meetings in less formal and intimidating settings, and using written communication that all parents can understand. Make parents feel welcome in the school by providing opportunities for parents to visit the school, observe classes, and give feedback.</paragraph><paragraph parID="719">Consider building a parent center for parents to use while at school. Engage parents in decision-making practices of advisory groups (such as local school-improvement councils), school reform committees, and other school restructuring efforts. IMPLEMENTATION PITFALLS :  Inconsistencies in individual interactions between families and school personnel in various situations can undermine a positive school climate. Cultural differences also can bring about mixed or wrong messages affecting how families feel when they participate. Therefore, cross-checks must be made to ensure the consistency of the school's atmosphere across all types of families and situations. Some parents are reluctant to engage in their children's education and may never perceive schools as friendly, accepting places. Schools must make numerous and continuous attempts to reach reluctant families through a variety of means.</paragraph><paragraph parID="720">Some parents may try to use their influence to control what goes on at school (for example, in classrooms when they volunteer) and what decisions are made in school committees. Such parents overstep their boundaries by using an "I know best" attitude instead of a "we" concept. To prevent such situations, schools can designate a parent volunteer coordinator to inform parents about school policies and philosophy and to keep a close check on parents as they participate in school activities. Some administrators, school board members, and teachers may have difficulty relinquishing their decision-making power. Although they may give the appearance of encouraging parent involvement, they prefer to remain in total control of making all decisions. Such educators also may be suspicious of parent motives for involvement. By promoting the participation of many different groups of parents and by providing numerous forums in which parents can voice their opinions, schools can prevent one person from becoming omnipotent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="721">DIFFERENT POINTS OF VIEW :   Despite encouragement from teachers and administrators, some parents may be reluctant or unable to become involved in their children's school. They may view education as the business of only the people who work in schools. Although many teachers relate family involvement with student success, better teaching, and a positive school climate, some think they cannot improve the level of family involvement in their classrooms (Epstein, 1992). Some principals and administrators may wish to limit parent involvement to bake sales and PTA meetings, thereby excluding parents from decision-making and governance roles in the school. They may believe that they have a better perspective of what is necessary and helpful for their school. ILLUSTRATIVE CASES Such partnerships connect families and schools to help children succeed in school and in their future.</paragraph><paragraph parID="722">GOALS : They may feel confused about typical school procedures and intimidated by the school staff. Others parents may believe that school provides hope for their children's future but are uncertain how to become involved.

Parents move from being school volunteers and/or advocates for their own children to become sophisticated critics of school reform and resourceful change agents whose actions benefit all educational stakeholders. The program begins with a 3-month-long sequence of workshops that introduce Fellows to their rights to know about and gain access to school operations; key elements of Kentucky's reform legislation and policy; where to go and whom to contact for information about educational and community resources; and specific ways to act as advocates for school reform. Upon completion of the training, each Fellow undertakes a project designed to have an eventual effect on student achievement, involve other parents, and be sustainable in subsequent years. From an initial 3-year evaluation of CIPL, we learned that Fellows significantly increased their knowledge about schools and school reform, built their confidence to work in those settings, and expanded their willingness to act for the betterment of all students in their community. 2 Recently, we investigated the experiences of all Fellows subsequent to their "graduation" from CIPL to see if their training continued to have ramifications in their children's schools, their local districts and communities, and the state. In summer 2007, we conducted interviews with nearly 60 parents chosen from a list of 100 parents provided by CIPL.</paragraph><paragraph parID="724">The obvious bias toward "activist" parents was intentional, to allow us to bring to the surface a rich and deep collection of experiences. We asked parents about their project's sustainability, their continued engagement in educational activities, and the facilitators and barriers to their engagement. Out of these interview responses, we developed a survey, which we mailed to all 1,200 CIPL graduates across the 10 years of the program. Survey items measured continued networking with CIPL and other Fellows, ongoing project activity, further knowledge acquired about educational issues, the impact of CIPL experiences on Fellows' current engagement in schools, ability to promote CIPL goals, and the effect of CIPL on personal and professional lives. From interview and survey results, we found four main themes: a) Fellows became more concerned with promoting the best interests of all children, not just their own; b) fellows sustained their involvement post-training and broadened its scope beyond schools; c) fellows felt empowered to act because they felt more knowledgeable, confident, and competent; and d) fellows become more influential in their schools and communities. Related Resource Commissioner's Parents Advisory Council.</paragraph><paragraph parID="725">The missing piece of the proficiency puzzle: Recommendations for involving families and communities in improving student achievement. Final report to the Kentucky Department of Education . Frankfort, KY: Kentucky Department of Education. In this report, the Kentucky Commissioner's Parent Advisory Council (CPAC), the majority of whose members have completed the Prichard Committee's CIPL training, recommends that Kentucky become the first state in the nation to set standards for family involvement focused on improving student achievement. The report includes six objectives for increasing family and community involvement in education and a rubric for rating family and community involvement in the schools. www.education.ky.gov The interview data richly illustrated these themes, as nearly every interviewee offered examples of how CIPL training influenced his or her life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="726">The most obvious impact was parents' realization that they could make a difference. One parent described voicing her opinion at a local school board meeting. Before CIPL, she said, "I absolutely would not have been there to speak up." Fellows also acquired the ability to understand educational jargon, which led to greater comfort and a sense of empowerment in advocating for school reform. One parent said, "I can now talk with teachers comfortably, understand their vernacular, and am better able to evaluate what they are telling me." New knowledge and skills spurred parents' willingness to tackle broader issues. Many said they joined a school committee or attended school board meetings after discovering that they knew state regulations governing the operation of school-based decision-making councils as well as or better than some school administrators.</paragraph><paragraph parID="727">Some used their knowledge to force school officials to comply with formal guidelines and procedures and to inform other parents about their rights. The Fellows continue to play a variety of active and visible roles in their communities and the state. In these capacities, Fellows have had a direct hand in shaping curricula, consolidating schools, and hiring superintendents. Beyond the local school systems, Fellows lobby the state legislature about increasing educational funding and tailoring policies to better meet students' needs, serve on various state commissions or advisory councils, and speak to teacher education students around the state about parents' perspectives. The study's data point to the conclusion that a program such as CIPL can be effective in prompting some parents-perhaps those already inclined toward activism-to become keenly involved in schools and school reform. The cumulative weight of what we have learned so far is best summed up by one parent's exclamation: "I didn't know I could do that!" 2 Our report, I Didn't Know I Could Do That: Parents Learning to be Leaders Through the Commonwealth Institute for Parent Leadership , was prepared in 2000 with support from The Pew Charitable Trusts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="728">Parents as Educational Leaders Quick Links Some are members of local, site-based decision-making councils, while others have won seats on local school boards. Latino Parents' Involvement: Effects on Students' Math Achievement in Kindergarten Dr. Claudia Galindo, Postdoctoral Research Scientist with NNPS, used a national database (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten or ECLS-K) to study whether parental involvement and family-school partnerships helped reduce Latino students' educational disadvantages in kindergarten. She analyzed Hispanic parents' patterns of parental involvement and family and school partnerships and their effects on math learning for 14,297 students, including 2,858 Latino students. Variables included: parental involvement at school, parental involvement in educational activities at home, parents' educational expectations for their children, and parents' perception of school outreach efforts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="729">Patterns of Parents' Involvement and Family-School Partnerships Galindo found important differences among racial/ethnic groups. On average, Latino parents had higher educational expectations for their children and more positive perceptions of school outreach than did White parents, but lower levels of involvement in educational activities at home and at school. Also, there were statistically significant differences among Hispanic subgroups. Cuban parents and South American parents had the highest educational expectations for their children, more positive perceptions of school outreach, and the highest levels of involvement. By contrast, Central American parents had the lowest ratings on these indicators. Influence of Involvement on Math Achievement</paragraph><paragraph parID="730">All parental involvement variables, except educational activities at home, were related to students' math scores. Students had higher math test scores if their parents reported more positive school outreach efforts, higher levels of involvement at school, and higher educational expectations. The lack of association between involvement at home and math achievement could be due to the nature of the measures in the ECSL-K data base. The measures were reading-related (i.e., read books to child, look at picture books outside of school, and child reads or pretend to reads). The survey did not refer to math-related involvement activities at home. As Epstein (2001) showed in previous studies, positive effects on student learning are most likely to result from subject-specific and content-related involvement activities. Thus, future studies should include family involvement activities in math for questions about math outcomes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="731">Standardized Testing The No Child Left Behind Act is up for renewal this year, so Katie Couric wonders whether standardized tests truly measure how kids do in school and life.

Parent involvement in elementary school and educational attainment. This Research Brief was produced for release at the Raising Student Achievement, 2006 National PTA Legislative Conference. Family involvement promotes school success for every child of every age. The evidence is clear: Family involvement helps children get ready to enter school, promotes their school success, and prepares youth for college. This Research Brief presents findings from HFRP's ongoing, in-depth review of research and evaluated programs that link family involvement in children's education to student outcomes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="750">Family involvement helps children get ready to enter school. Research Findings: &#8226; Children whose parents read to them at home recognize letters of the alphabet sooner than those whose parents do not. &#8226; Children whose parents teach them how to write words are able to identify letters and connect them to speech sounds. &#8226; Children whose mothers use complex sentences in their everyday conversations achieve high scores on literacy-related tasks in kindergarten. Evaluated Program: Raising a Reader Raising a Reader is a program that provides books for children from birth through age 5 and encourages parents to read to their children every day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="751">When parents establish a reading routine with their children, they provide more family bonding time and an opportunity for their children's vocabulary and preliteracy skills to grow. Six independent evaluations show that Raising a Reader improves reading behavior and kindergarten readiness, especially for low-income, non-English speaking families. Begun in California, Raising a Reader has spread to 24 U.S. states and three countries. Family involvement promotes elementary school children's success. &#8226; Children in grades K-3 whose parents participate in school activities have high quality work habits and task orientation. &#8226; Children whose parents explain educational tasks are more likely to participate in class, seek help from the teacher when needed, and monitor their own work. Families and Schools Together (FAST) Families and Schools Together (FAST) is a program designed to build relationships within families and between families and schools to address childhood problems such as school failure, violence, and delinquency.</paragraph><paragraph parID="752">Five experimental studies found that the program made a positive impact on elementary students' health, social skills, behavior, and academic competence and on parents' parenting skills. Family involvement prepares youth for college. &#8226; Adolescents whose parents monitor their academic and social activities have lower rates of delinquency and higher rates of social competence and academic growth. &#8226; Youth whose parents are familiar with college preparation requirements and are engaged in the application process are most likely to graduate high school and attend college. &#8226; Youth whose parents have high academic expectations and who offer consistent encouragement for college have positive student outcomes. Parent Institute for Quality Education (PIQE) PIQE's 9-week training course for parents has successfully reduced high school drop out rates and college participation for Latino youth living in California. Specifically, the children of parents who graduated from PIQE in one region of California achieved a high school graduation rate of 93%, compared to the national high school graduation rate for Latinos of 53%.</paragraph><paragraph parID="753">10 Moreover, nearly 80% of the Latino youth whose parents participated in PIQE enrolled in college. &#8226; Low-income African American children whose families maintained high rates of parent participation in elementary school are more likely to complete high school. &#8226; Low-income African American children with mothers involved in their education showed more self-control in unruly and disorganized classrooms than children whose parents did not provide supportive relationships at home. &#8226; Latino youth who are academically high achieving have parents who provide encouragement and emphasize the value of education as a way out of poverty. Chicago Child-Parent Centers (CPC) The CPC program served low-income preschoolers through third graders and promoted parent involvement through home visits, classroom volunteer opportunities, workshops and courses, and parent-teacher meetings. Low-income children who participated in CPC were more prepared for kindergarten and less likely to be referred to special education. They also tested higher in eighth grade reading, were more likely to finish high school, and had lower rates of grade retention.</paragraph><paragraph parID="754">14 Family involvement in the CPC program during the early years was associated with greater parent involvement in the elementary school years, which in turn was related with positive student outcomes in high school.

Harvard Family Research Project (HFRP) at the Harvard Graduate School of Education delivers research evidence and information to a national audience of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Journal of Adolescent Research, 16 , 511-529; Rankin, B., &amp;amp; Quane, J. M. (2002). The Culpeper County School Board recognizes that the education of each student is a responsibility shared by the school and the student&#65533;s family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="756">The Culpeper County School Board endorses the parental involvement goals of Title I (20 U.S.C. &#65533; 6318) and Title III (20 U.S.C. 7012(e) and encourages the regular participation by parents of all children including those eligible for Title I and Limited English Proficiency (LEP) programs in all aspects of those programs. In keeping with these beliefs, it is the intention of the Culpeper County School Board to cultivate and support active parental involvement in student learning. The Culpeper County School Board will: provide activities that will educate parents regarding the intellectual and developmental needs of their children. These activities will promote cooperation between the division and other agencies or school/community groups (such as parent-teacher groups, the Head Start program, the Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) and private/community-based teacher training) to furnish learning opportunities and disseminate information regarding parenting skills and child/adolescent development; implement strategies to involve parents in the educational process, including:</paragraph><paragraph parID="757">-           keeping families informed of opportunities for involvement and encouraging participation in various programs; -           providing access to educational resources for parents and families to use with their children; -           keeping families informed of the objectives of district educational programs as well as of their child&#65533;s participation and progress with these programs; enable families to participate in the education of their children through a variety of roles.</paragraph><paragraph parID="758">For example, family members may: - provide input into district policies - volunteer time within the classroom and school programs. provide professional development opportunities for teachers and staff to enhance their understanding of effective parent involvement strategies; perform regular evaluations of parent involvement at each school and in the district; provide access, upon request, to any instructional material used as part of the educational curriculum; if practicable, provide information in a language understandable to parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="759">In addition, for parents of students eligible for LEP programs, the School Board will inform such parents of how they can be active participants in assisting their children: to learn English; to achieve at high levels in core academic subjects; and to meet the same challenging academic content and student academic achievement standards as all children are expected to meet. Parental Involvement in Title I Plan The Culpeper County School District encourages parents of children eligible to participate in Title I, Part A, programs to participate in the development of the District&#65533;s Title I plan.</paragraph><paragraph parID="760">Parents may participate by: Filling out parent surveys to be used to improve the instructional program. Providing input through PTO, SACS (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools), PAC (Parent Advisory Council), other school-based advisory teams and committees at each school. Accessing the Title I parent web page. Volunteering to assist with transition activities of students in Culpeper Public Schools, such as preschool, LEP, and community-based schools. Attending parent workshops on requested topics/needs. (The Title I teachers will offer four workshops per year and the Lead Teacher/Parent Liaison will provide four additional workshops at each Title I school.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="761">Reviewing materials and technology used to supplement classroom instruction. Offering translation services for LEP parents (translate forms/translate at meetings). Attending parent conferences at least twice a year. Reading monthly Title I newsletters. Providing the Title I office with input on needs (ISPs), meeting times, and program evaluation. Using the Summer Book-By-Mail program. Continuing to use the Writer&#65533;s Box program.</paragraph><paragraph parID="762">Parental Involvement in School Review and Improvement The Culpeper County School District encourages parents of children eligible to participate in Title I, Part A, and LEP programs to participate in the process of school review and, if applicable, school improvement as implemented by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.S.C. &#65533; 2316. Becoming a member of the School Planning Team to develop a school improvement plan. Being involved in the SACS (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) which promotes school excellence. Becoming an active member of PAC (Parent Advisory Committee). District Responsibilities The Culpeper County School District, and each school which receives Title I, Part A, funds, will :</paragraph><paragraph parID="763">provide assistance to parents of children served by the school or district, as applicable, in understanding topics such as Virginia&#65533;s academic content standards and student academic achievement standards, state and local academic assessments, and how to monitor a child's progress and work with educators to improve the achievement of their children; provide materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their children&#65533;s achievement, such as literacy training and using technology, as appropriate, to foster parental involvement; educate teachers, pupil services personnel, principals, and other staff, with the assistance of parents, in the value and utility of contributions of parents and in how to reach out to, communicate with, and work with parents as equal partners, implement and coordinate parent programs, and build ties between parents and the school; to the extent feasible and appropriate, coordinate and integrate parental involvement programs and activities with Head Start, the Home Instruction Programs for Preschool Youngsters, and public preschool and other programs, and conduct other activities, such as parent resource centers, that encourage and support parents in more fully participating in the education of their children; ensure that information related to school and parent programs, meetings, and other activities is sent to the parents of participating children in a format and, to the extent practicable, in a language the parents can understand; and</paragraph><paragraph parID="764">provide such other reasonable support for parental involvement activities as parents may request. The Culpeper County School District, and each school which receives Title I, Part A, funds, may : provide necessary literacy training from Title I funds if the district has exhausted all other reasonable available sources of funding for such training; adopt and implement model approaches to improving parental involvement; School Parental Involvement Policies Each school served under Title I, Part A, shall jointly develop with and distribute to parents of participating children a written parental involvement policy, agreed on by</paragraph><paragraph parID="765">such parents, that shall describe the means for carrying out the following: convening an annual meeting, at a convenient time, to which all parents of participating children shall be invited and encouraged to attend, to inform parents of their school&#65533;s participation in Title I, Part A, and to explain the requirements of Title I, Part A, and the rights of parents to be involved; offering a flexible number of meetings, such as meetings in the morning or evening, and may provide, with funds provided under this part, transportation, child care, or home visits, as such services relate to parental involvement; involving parents, in an organized, ongoing, and timely way, in the planning, review, and improvement of Title I, Part A, programs including the planning, review, and improvement of the school parental involvement policy and the joint development of the schoolwide program plan under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.S.C. &#65533; 6312(b)(2), except that if a school has in place a process for involving parents in the joint planning and design of the school&#65533;s programs, the school may use that process, if such process includes an adequate representation of parents of participating children; providing parents of participating children: -              timely information about Title I, Part A, programs; -              a description and explanation of the curriculum in use at the school, the academic assessments used to measure student progress, and the proficiency levels students are expected to meet; and</paragraph><paragraph parID="766">-              if requested by parents, opportunities for regular meetings to formulate suggestions and to participate, as appropriate, in decisions relating to the education of their children, and respond to any such suggestions as soon as practicably possible; and if the schoolwide program plan under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U.S.C. &#65533; 6312(b)(2) is not satisfactory to the parents of participating children, submitting any parent comments on the plan when the school makes the plan available to the District. Parental Involvement in Allocation of Funding Parents of children receiving services under Title I, Part A, shall be involved in the decisions regarding how funds provided under Title I, Part A, are allotted for parental involvement activities. Policy Review The content and effectiveness of this policy will be evaluated annually with regard to improving the academic quality of the schools receiving Title I, Part A, or LEP funds.</paragraph><paragraph parID="767">This evaluation will identify barriers to greater participation by parents (particularly by parents who are economically disadvantaged, have disabilities, have limited English proficiency, have limited literacy, or are of any racial or ethnic minority background) and use the findings of that evaluation to design strategies for more effective parental involvement, and to revise, if necessary, this policy. In schools across the nation, teachers frequently point to the lack of parent involvement in their children's schooling as a major obstacle, particularly at the elementary and middle school levels. Educators in the Northwest Region are no exception. In the 2007/08 Schools and Staffing Survey, half (51 percent) of Northwest public school teachers rated "lack of parental involvement" as a moderate or serious problem, which was close to the national rate (52 percent). Eleven percent of Northwest public school teachers strongly disagreed that they "receive a great deal of support from parents" for the work they do, and 24 percent somewhat disagreed. REL Northwest Studies This report addresses the fact that although the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 spells out parent involvement requirements for schools in need of improvement, the majority (54 percent) of the 84 percent of the Northwest Region school improvement plans reviewed by REL Northwest researchers failed to include such provisions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="768">The researchers found that many schools rely on communication as the primary way to involve parents-despite the wide range of parent involvement practices discussed in the literature. Featured Products From Other RELs Examining American Indian Perspectives in the Central Region on Parent Involvement in Children's Education This study examines American Indian parents' perceptions of parent involvement in their children's education and factors that may encourage or discourage involvement. Discouraging factors included feeling unwelcome or intimidated at the school, which was accompanied by perceptions of racism and discrimination; experiencing scheduling, transportation, childcare, and financial difficulties; and having prior negative experiences with their own or their children's education.

Parents and Schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="769">Parent involvement is critical in facilitating children's development and achievement and in preventing and remedying educational and developmental problems. Declining achievement scores, rising educational costs, and distrust of bureaucratic institutions are among the factors which have refocused attention on the rights, responsibilities, and impact of parents. BENEFITS TO CHILDREN Substantial evidence exists to show that children whose parents are involved in their schooling have significantly increased their academic achievement and cognitive development (Andrews and others 1982; Henderson 1981; and Herman and Yeh 1980). The parent-child relationship is improved and parents more frequently participate in the child's activities. Parents also increase the number of contacts made with the school and their understanding of child development and the educational process. Another effect of parent-school cooperation is that parents become better teachers of their children at home and use more positive forms of reinforcement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="770">EFFECTS OF PARENT INVOLVEMENT Research reports indicate that parents involved in child care and educational programs develop positive attitudes about themselves, increase self-confidence, and often enroll in programs to enhance their personal development. EFFECTIVE APPROACHES TO PARENT INVOLVEMENT Parent visits to the center, school, or classroom, parent meetings and workshops, and parent-teacher conferences are effective in encouraging parents' participation in their children's education. Written and verbal information from teachers on the program and the children's progress is also helpful (Herman and Yeh 1980; Meighan 198l; Seginer 1983). Parents most enjoy participating in classroom activities, parent meetings, and policy planning sessions (McKinney 1980). They are most interested in meetings dealing with educational concerns or personal growth and development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="771">Of less interest are meetings dealing with careers, job training, and social services. Somewhat surprisingly, social and fundraising activities were listed by parents as the least popular form of parent involvement. Researchers found that teachers are sometimes reluctant to encourage parent involvement because they --Are uncertain about how to involve parents and still maintain their role as specialized "experts" --Are uncertain about how to balance their concern for the group of children against a more personalized concern for each individual child, which they believe would be expected if parents were more involved (McPherson 1972) --Believe parent involvement activities take too much planning time, turn responsibility for teaching over to parents, and are disruptive because parents do not know how to work with children --Are concerned that parents may use non-standard English or demonstrate other undesirable characteristics</paragraph><paragraph parID="772">--Question whether parents will keep commitments, refrain from sharing confidential information, and avoid being overly critical On the other hand, parents complain that the bureaucracy of the schools discourages their involvement and their expression of concerns, complaints, and demands (Wagenaar 1976). CHARACTERISTICS OF SUCCESSFUL PARENT INVOLVEMENT PROGRAMS Despite difficulties, the proven benefits of parent participation result in continued interest in developing these programs. The following characteristics are a basis for developing, implementing, and evaluating successful parent involvement efforts. Included are assumptions about parents held by teachers and principals who operate successful programs as well as principles for implementing such programs. Assumptions Made about Parents</paragraph><paragraph parID="773">Successful programs emphasize the contributions parents already make to their children's development and education. As a result, parents feel good about themselves and the program and are more willing to become actively involved. In the belief that parents can make additional contributions, successful programs help parents identify other skills they can share. Parents have important perspectives on their children and can provide the teacher with information about their child's relationships, interests, and experiences outside of the school or center. Successful programs recognize these differences when suggesting home activities and view processes and activities from the perspective of the parents rather than from that of the staff. Successful programs recognize that most parents really care about their children but may feel it is more important to spend an evening at home than to attend a meeting only distantly concerned with their child. Staff also believe parents are interested in learning parenting, developmental, and educational techniques.</paragraph><paragraph parID="774">Effective programs understand that parents have many reasons for their involvement, that they may have good intentions but may not understand how to help. The staff takes care to clearly state objectives and ways for parents to work well with their child. Principles for Implementing Successful Programs --Match goals, purposes, and activities --Recognize variations in parents' skills --Respond to parent needs with flexible and creative program activities --Communicate expectations, roles, and responsibilities</paragraph><paragraph parID="775">--Involve parents in decision making and explain administrative decisions to encourage parents to respond to decisions rationally --Expect problems but emphasize solutions. Because problems are anticipated, policies and procedures for resolving them are developed and communicated to parents. "Failure" is not blamed on the parents --Seek optimum versus maximum involvement. Parent involvement takes time, effort, and energy. If staff or parents become overextended, they may feel drained and resentful</paragraph><paragraph parID="776">CAUTIONS AND CONCERNS Responsiveness to the following concerns may help to justify increasing optimism that parent involvement can improve education and educational opportunities for children. --Continuous and increased emphasis on the crucial role of parents in facilitating intelligence, achievement, and educability can place excessive pressure and responsibility on parents --Little attention is given to the role of the father --The focus of educational responsibility should not shift toward the parent so much that schools, programs, and teachers fail to examine the ways in which they might change to more fully enhance children's development, education, and achievement --Parent involvement programs may antagonize teachers who already feel overwhelmed by responsibilities beyond the direct instructional role Successful parent involvement programs benefit parents, children, and teachers and, therefore, have significant impact on children's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="777">This information enhances the teacher's understanding of the child and contributes to more effective teaching. Whereas parent-child relationships are personal, subjective, and long-term, teacher-child relationships are objective, impersonal, and short term. Nancy Hill : The most important findings to date include the consistent evidence that parents and families matter for children's achievement across developmental levels from preschool through college; identification of the multiple dimensions of family involvement, such as involvement in academic activities at home, volunteering at school, and participating in school governance and communication between parents and teachers; and socioeconomic and ethnic variations in family involvement in education and its impact on achievement. A recent study found that, across socioeconomic status (SES) levels, parental involvement in seventh grade was positively associated with students' educational and occupational goals in eleventh grade. &#185; However, the mechanisms of this relationship differed across SES levels. For the higher SES families, family involvement in the seventh grade was associated with eleventh- grade educational and occupational goals through its influence on school behavior and academic performance. In contrast, for the lower SES families, while there was a strong direct relation between family involvement and educational and occupational goals, family involvement was not associated with academic behavior or achievement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="778">These findings suggest that while parents from all backgrounds may understand the importance of involvement, and may indeed become involved, they vary in their effectiveness across SES. The research on ethnic differences in parental involvement demonstrates differences among Whites, African Americans, and Hispanics on the types of involvement strategies engaged in, their mechanisms of influence, and their effectiveness. These findings across demographic backgrounds are important for translating research to programs and policies. Website to Watch The newly created Family Strengthening Policy Center (FSPC), a program of the National Human Services Assembly, seeks to make family strengthening a priority among human services organizations. Funded by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, FSPC is also a part of the Foundation's Neighborhood Transformation/Family Development and Making Connections initiatives. A series of FSPC policy briefs includes articles on the role of parent involvement in education and on child well-being, as well as on the connections among families, schools, and community resources brought about through school-linked services.</paragraph><paragraph parID="779">www.nassembly.org/fspc Additional research is needed to identify mechanisms that explain ethnic and socioeconomic variations in family involvement in school. Although the literature is consistent about mean-level differences in involvement and about differences across SES and ethnicity in the effectiveness of involvement, we still need a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these differences that would inform intervention programs. Additional research also is needed to better understand developmental variations in appropriate family involvement between elementary and middle schools. Although some research finds that parental involvement declines between elementary and middle school, family involvement still matters for adolescents. Much of the research, theory, and program development for family involvement in education are based on elementary-school based models, including a single teacher with whom to develop a relationship and a welcoming environment. Current theory and research do not include aspects of family involvement that are unique to middle school, such as involvement in course and track placement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="780">It is these types of involvement strategies-those unique to the middle school level-that open or close doors of opportunity for adolescents when they graduate from high school. With regard to evaluation, scientists and practitioners need to pay particular attention to the effectiveness of programs for families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnic minority backgrounds. Impoverished families are less likely to become involved in schooling than wealthier families, and schools in impoverished communities are less likely to promote family involvement in education than schools in affluent communities. Disadvantaged families need more information than their more affluent counterparts. Intervention programs, therefore, may be more effective in promoting and enhancing parental involvement for more affluent families than for lower SES families. Differential effectiveness of an intervention program for enhancing family involvement could, consequently, result in an increase in demographic gaps in achievement. It is therefore important for intervention studies to investigate how to reach out to disadvantaged families in order to promote involvement among families from all backgrounds.</paragraph><paragraph parID="781">Amy Baker : Decades of developmental theory and basic research have documented that parental involvement in children's social, emotional, and cognitive development is of paramount importance for children's well-being and attainment of positive long-term outcomes. Nonetheless, applied evaluation research has been much less successful at making the case for the effectiveness of specific parent involvement programs and practices. Although this "evidence gap" is generally attributed to the inability of educational and evaluation researchers to employ random assignment designs, other methodological limitations are equally problematic. These include the use of nonobjective measures and inconsistent definitions, and failure to isolate the effects of parental involvement from other components of intervention programs or parenting practices. It is likely, for example, that the effects of parental involvement are mediated by ecological and contextual factors, such as the quality of the parent-child attachment relationship, educational philosophy of the school, practices of specific teachers, children's individual learning styles, and variation within parent involvement programs and practices. However, too often evaluation research is insufficiently theory driven to measure these contextual variables. Moreover, the small samples typical of evaluation studies tend to prohibit a thorough analysis of within-group differences on outcomes due to preexisting characteristics or intervening experiences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="782">The multisite evaluation of Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters is illustrative. &#178; The impact of the program's parent-child educational activities on children's academic achievement was found to vary both within and across sites. However, the significant intervening factors could not be identified, because the sample size did not allow for analysis of interaction effects and mediating processes. A further challenge for the field is that although policymakers call for increased parental involvement, practical and valid guidance is generally not available to help schools, teachers, and parents realize this goal. Qualitative research has demonstrated that, despite sharing the belief that parental involvement is a worthy objective, parents, teachers, and school administrators have very different ideas about what parental involvement means in the day-to-day life of schools and families, and about how to achieve it. Far too little attention has been paid to facilitating this process on the front line. Parent involvement research needs to take better advantage of evaluation science, be more theory driven in selection of measures and testing of hypotheses, and be more willing to incorporate the perspectives of children, parents, and teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="783">Only with the combined strengths of scientific rigor and practical applicability can the promise of parental involvement be achieved. Kevin Marjoribanks : Research and evaluation suggest that parents have a major role to play in their children's learning and in creating educational opportunities. We know that an academically oriented family environment for elementary school children tends to be one where parents have high aspirations for their children, provide stimulating reading and other learning experiences, have an understanding of the importance of schooling, and have knowledge of their children's schoolwork. We also know that high school students benefit when parents provide, or are assisted in providing, a family setting in which they encourage their children to stay on at school, talk about the importance of schooling, praise children for schoolwork and homework, show interest in what their children are doing at school, and have high aspirations for their children. However, we also know that for some families, supportive learning environments do not translate into children's school success. Students from certain cultural and social groups receive fewer rewards for their interactions with parents and other adults than do students from other groups. School organizational and academic structures can create constraints on the educational opportunities of students, depending on family background.</paragraph><paragraph parID="784">Although programs may be developed to assist parents with the enrichment of learning experiences in the home, it may be just as important for parents to be actively involved in decisions that schools make about their children. The placement of students into certain schools or in ability groups within schools, for example, may relate as much to family- -background considerations as to children's academic potential. Parents may need to become more socially and politically active to ensure that their children receive school experiences that are related to meaningful educational outcomes. Family involvement research and program practice have tended to concentrate on individual-family factors, such as encouragement, support, opportunities, and aspirations. It is likely, however, that for children from certain family backgrounds there exist group-family factors, such as group sharing of economic resources for children's education, the premium placed by the group on education, and group solidarity, that are of major importance; these factors must be better reflected in research and practice. Parent involvement programs are unlikely to reduce substantially family-background inequalities in educational outcomes until they enhance individual-family factors, incorporate group-family factors, and involve parents meaningfully in school decisions about their children's educational experiences. As such, intervention studies need to consider parent involvement programs in light of those family-background characteristics that influence children's life chances.</paragraph><paragraph parID="785">Parent academic involvement as related to school behavior, achievement, and aspirations: Demographic variations across adolescence.

Make a chart showing when chores need to be done and when assignments are due. Volunteer. Build a sense of community and caring by giving your time. Choose projects in which children and teens can take part, too. When homework time comes, establish a specific time and place for doing it. Include the child in establishing the time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="787">(See Figure 4.5) Find a place where the student can easily access any resource materials or get parental assistance if needed. Help your student develop a system for organizing materials, assignments, worksheets, etc. Periodically check the system to make certain it still provides a logical framework for the child. Check homework for completion and accuracy to your best ability. Some teachers want to see the mistakes a student makes on homework so they know what the student is learning and what they are struggling with. Assist your child with studying for tests by reviewing text information. Create a homework contract, an agreement regarding homework responsibilities, with your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="788">It can save a parent from one of those nasty battles referred to earlier. Remember: Homework is given to the child, not the parent. The parent is responsible for providing any needed assistance. Parents encourage good study habits by establishing homework routines early. Agree together on a regular time and place for homework. Try to schedule homework time for when you or your child's caregiver can supervise. Make sure your son or daughter understands the assignment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="789">Sign and date your young children's homework. Teachers appreciate it when they know that the parents are interested enough to check over their children's homework and see that it is finished. Follow up on homework assignments by asking to see your children's homework after it has been returned by the teacher. Look at the teacher's comments to see if your children have done the assignments correctly. Discuss teachers' homework expectations during teacher-parent conferences. Don't do your children's homework. Make sure they understand that homework is their responsibility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="790">Be sure to praise your children for a job well done. Encourage the good work that your children do and comment about improvements they have made. Teachers can help parents win the homework battle too. Being an ally with the parents and supporting them in their efforts is immeasurably important for success in this area. How involved the teacher decides to be may vary a great deal. Some of the following suggestions require very little time or energy on the part of the teacher. Others hint of a whole new way of looking at homework and what its purpose should be.</paragraph><paragraph parID="791">Initiate a "Homework Hotline" that parents and students can access to get homework assignments, test dates and other important information. Remember to carry the information in multiple languages to suit the school's population. Provide parents with suggestions on how to help with homework. If a child has special needs, homework may be a particularly stressful time. Information on how to work with their child is invaluable to many parents who struggle to understand their child's learning style. * Provide parents with a homework chart similar to those used by Perry Local Schools in Massillon, Ohio. Have parents sign the sheet and allow space for any comments or questions they might have.</paragraph><paragraph parID="792">Not all parents know what constitutes good study habits. Providing them with some guidelines to review with their child can give them the insight they need to help their child develop good study habits. Interactive homework--where the students must involve a parent or other adult to complete the assignment--is gaining in popularity. It can be used at all levels of education and usually includes communication from the parent as to how the student did with the project. You can learn many things from children. How much patience you have for instance. The TIPS process (Teachers Involve Parents in Schoolwork) is one example of interactive homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="793">Provide parents with suggestions for in-home resource libraries. What type of reference books will the student in your class need? Suggest computer software to parents who have a home computer. For those who do not, perhaps arrangements could be made to allow access to the school's computer lab after regular school hours or on weekends. Note: For many parents, it may be beneficial to provide some computer education opportunities. There are still a large number of parents who are not computer literate even if they have a computer at home. Parents--The Key To Success</paragraph><paragraph parID="794">When parents make an effort to be involved with their child's school work, the child realizes that education is important to the parent. A life-long love of learning can emerge through the support of a parent. Children tend to work harder at their studies when parents are involved. Parents should set high standards for their children and encourage them to work hard to reach their full potential. As a child advances to secondary education, parents need to encourage their child to enroll in courses that challenge him/ her. They should discuss career paths and opportunities. It is important to continue to be as involved as possible in all aspects of their child's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="795">Above all, parents should always believe that their child can learn and that they, as parents, have an important role to play in that learning. Benefits when parents can better help their children learn at home: Good communication and a teacher-parent "team" philosophy are the foundation of successful parent involvement at home. Parents, across all groups studied by the Institute, said they wanted to be involved in their child's education. Perhaps by understanding the prejudices and stereotypes that can get in the way of genuine partnering, schools can reduce the negative effects they might have. If, as research indicates, a high level of parent involvement is critical to a child's educational success, schools must involve parents in the process as early as possible. Showing parents how to create a home environment that supports their child as a student is a good place to start.</paragraph><paragraph parID="796">Benefits when schools facilitate better parenting: For Students; Awareness of family supervision and caring. Development of positive personal qualities, habits, beliefs, values, taught by the family. Awareness of the importance of school. For Parents; Understanding and confidence about parenting, child and adolescent development, and changes in home conditions for learning as children proceed through school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="797">Awareness of own and others' parenting challenges. Feeling of support from school and other parents. For Teachers; Understanding families' backgrounds, cultures, concerns, goals, needs, and views of their children. Respect for families' strengths and efforts. Understanding of individual student diversity. Awareness of own skills to share information on child development.</paragraph><paragraph parID="798">School Self-Assessment on Parenting Do we sponsor parent education workshops and other courses or training for parents? Do we provide families with information on child or adolescent development? Do we provide families with information on developing home conditions that support learning? Do we lend families books or tapes on parenting or videotapes of parent workshops? Do we ask families for information about children's goals, strengths, and talents? Do we sponsor home visiting programs or neighborhood meetings to help families understand schools and to help schools understand families?</paragraph><paragraph parID="799">Key points to remember: Address classroom diversity: Provide interpreters, if needed. Make sure videotapes and phone messages meet the needs of parents who may not speak English. Include all parents. Parents of students with identified learning needs should be included in parenting workshops, videos and other communications. Hold all parenting workshops and meetings in accessible locations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="800">By focusing on ability-level, at the grade level, students with identified learning needs may be more fully included. Demonstrations make videos more interesting and informative for parents who may have learning needs. Don't forget the three F's: fun, food and family. Be sure people will have some fun in the parenting workshops you plan. Provide some food, pizza... to... pretzels. The more important the workshop, the more important the food. Keep families a focal point.</paragraph><paragraph parID="801">Invite grandparents or other significant family members. Offer childcare for all children and schedule events early enough for younger children to meet bedtimes. Use humor and a casual tone in producing the videos. Having videotape production areas set up in a permanent location may allow teachers a more immediate use of the equipment. No one likes to be lectured to. Get parent input when you begin thinking about your workshop. Parent input is a great resource to ensure that topics are relevant and timely for parent needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="802">Ask what topics they need help with. Find out how the parents can most effectively get the information you would like to share.

Haack and M. Haldy in Making It Easy Anne Morrow Lindberg, "Gift from the Sea", 1955</paragraph><paragraph parID="803">"Communication is the most important skill in life," according to Stephen R. Covey, author of the bestseller, "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (1989 p. 237)." He feels it is so important that he lists it as one of the seven most effective habits. As school personnel and parents seek to understand one another, they will form a relationship that is interdependent and leads to shared responsibility. Evolving ethical and legal philosophies, societal changes, and increased expectations for schools cause many schools to seek to establish collaboration between home and school. This collaboration necessitates the meaningful involvement of parents. The plan should be meaningful, effective, and specific, rather than haphazard and sporadic. It should be dynamic, ongoing, and reflective of the collaborative relationship.</paragraph><paragraph parID="804">The style and climate are different for each school, and the communication plan will reflect this. (See Figure 2.1) A commonality of purpose and expectations between school and home motivates a child. And when schools listen to and value parents they show that they are trying to meet the needs of their students. Although communication between home and school is important for all students, it is vital and indeed mandated when a child has special needs. These special needs may be related either to a disability or to unusual abilities. In those instances where the family has succeeded in meeting the child's needs within the family context, parents can share information and attitudes about the child with the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="805">This information is often valuable and could contribute to the child's being successfully included in an educational setting as well. Written and oral communication should incorporate person first language, according to the Axis Center in Columbus, Ohio. Person first language identifies a person's name, qualities, characteristics or abilities rather than identifying a person's disability. Communication should avoid phrases such as "the special education students" or "the disabled" because these phrases imply a group identity that denies individuality. By speaking and writing about people appropriately, schools will help create a mind-set and an atmosphere that emphasize the value and uniqueness of everyone. Communication to all households in the community has the potential to broaden support for schools. People who do not have children in school but who see the need to share responsibility may become involved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="806">Community relationships and an information sharing process benefit schools when levies are on the ballot. Schools that communicate with the entire community gain the support of classroom volunteers and long range planners. "The key, of course, is in the hands of parents themselves. If school systems are to recover their lost quality, if the United States is to survive as an economic leader, parents--and all stakeholders--must accept responsibility for the performance of their local school system. They must offer themselves as part-time teachers and teaching assistants. They must work with local political leaders to raise school budgets to pay teachers for performance (merit pay) and with school administrators to see that funds are used to promote effective classes in the core subjects. Above all, they must make certain that their own children understand the importance of a good education and have the support required for the difficult job of learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="807">In the years to come, more and more people will accept this challenge. The trend has clearly begun." Written Communication The newsletter provides an opportunity for parents to be aware of and respond to school information. The following guidance will be useful in creating a school newsletter: Be consistent by distributing the newsletter on a regular, expected schedule. Be sure that all students, regardless of their classroom placement, receive newsletters.</paragraph><paragraph parID="808">Junior high and high school newsletters reach parents more often if they are mailed. One sheet of paper will ensure greatest readership. Besides informing the reader of school special events and programs, include tips from teachers and other parents. Write at a reading level that will accommodate the abilities of all the parents. Include a book report written by a parent on a book of interest to parents and teachers. Have copies of the book available at the local library or at the school's parent/ professional resource center. Encourage parents to submit reviews of movies, videos, and excursions that they would recommend to other families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="809">Have an area of special interest in the newsletter devoted to student writing, art, computer scanned photos, or other graphics. Remind readers of the many options available to them for involvement with the school. Although this communication may seem one-way, recognize that parental involvement will change from year to year as lives and responsibilities change. Even parents who may not participate appreciate being informed about school matters. To increase readership, some schools send home classroom and school newsletters on an alternating basis. Offer translations of the newsletter to parents who are in the process of learning English. Parents can create opportunities for their children to develop responsibility as part of their daily routine.</paragraph><paragraph parID="810">Schools recognize the importance of character education and can assist parents by providing suggestions of activities that build responsibility. Loomans and Kolberg (1993) advise teachers to maintain a sense of humor while building responsibility in their students. Parents could find this activity valuable when dealing with the excuses children present when they fail to perform a required activity. Too often, we give children answers to remember rather than problems to solve! Use a simple cardboard box to help a child be responsible for school belongings. When he/she comes home from school, all belongings should be placed in the box. When homework is completed, it goes in the box.</paragraph><paragraph parID="811">The box is the last stop before the child heads out the door in the morning. Give a child responsibility for growing a small plant. The positive and negative results of carrying out responsibilities will be very clear. * The "Parents as Partners " committee from West Elementary School in Celina, Ohio held a workshop entitled "Let's Get Organized--On the Right Track" for parents of elementary school children. The workshop was presented in the fall of the school year. Held in the evening, the school provided childcare for parents who needed to bring children with them. Scheduling the workshop after the first grading period permitted parents, whose students were identified as needing organizational skill development, to be informed of the opportunity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="812">* Southwest Local School District, in southwest Ohio, offered parenting classes on a number of topics. Child development classes addressed infants through school-age, with workshop topics that included: a) Know what to expect from children at different ages. d) Learn new communication skills. e) Perform infant CPR and infant massage. f) Develop ways to stimulate your child's intellectual and emotional growth. g) Find ways to catch children being good. h) Identify effective time-out strategies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="813">i) Train children to comply with parental requests. j) Reduce or eliminate difficulties with tasks assigned for home completion. k) Set up intervention plans for home. Flyers were sent home with students, distributed through local agencies and advertised via press releases. Broadcast information about school events that require student assistance on school-access TV channels. Encourage parents to view the information as a student-volunteer bulletin board. Explain, as part of the broadcast, how a student's participation as a volunteer can build responsibility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="814">This explanation would enrich the bulletin board concept so it becomes a parent learning opportunity. * St. Bernard Elementary and Elmwood Place Elementary, near Cincinnati, Ohio, have minimal bus transportation. congregate and wait for their children's dismissal. The school takes the opportunity to show videos about how children learn. The videos include information about multiple intelligences and teaching strategies for children with special learning needs. * Southwest Local School District, in southwest Ohio, offers an annual workshop for parents of 4th, 5th and 6th grade students about "How to Talk to Your Kids About Sex. " They provide coffee and donuts and schedule the workshop during the school day while their children are occupied.</paragraph><paragraph parID="815">A school nurse is a teaching resource. The workshop could be videotaped for use by parents who were unable to attend. Now in its sixth year, the program has expanded from four to six sessions, offered three times a year, once in the fall, winter and spring. The workshops are presented by counselors and psychologists on topics identified through parent surveys and by previous parent evaluations. * Tri-Village Elementary School, in Ohio's Darke County, uses ten-minute videos to show parents what teachers are doing in the classrooms regarding curriculum. * Crosby Elementary School, in Hamilton County, holds a "Learning to Learn Mini-Workshop" for parents to "contribute to the understanding that a child's academic success is a shared responsibility with teacher-student-parent working in partnership." (See Figure 1.5)</paragraph><paragraph parID="816">Epstein's framework differentiates between parent training that teaches parents specific skills for classroom use and training opportunities that add to the general education of the parents. She says that after schools provide basic parenting training for parents, and after they provide appropriate grade-level training for parents, schools should provide parent training that makes parents all-around better educated people. - Sir Francis Bacon, 1597 Parents are a valuable resource in the classroom. Schools should be sure workshop presenters and trainers collaborate with special educators so that workshop materials include all students. Suggest that parents use a calendar to keep track of important events related to their child's grade level. Try day-long parent training programs with short repeated workshops on grade-level topics such as learning to read, discipline alternatives, talking with kids about sex, etc.</paragraph><paragraph parID="817">That same concept could be applied to parenting topics for individual grade levels. Circulating video libraries that increase parenting skills are as important as those that address classroom instructional techniques. The handouts used for the How to Read with Your Child workshop are provided as a sample. Parent Education and Training Parents could choose activities that personally interest them and achieve a personal goal (e. g., completing a GED, receiving credit toward a certificate or degree, or career placement opportunity). The National PTA Board of Directors has adopted a parent involvement position that promotes parent participation in "every facet of the education and development of children from birth to adulthood." This position further recognizes that parents are the principle influence in children's lives.</paragraph><paragraph parID="818">Parent involvement, according to the PTA, takes many forms. Parents are a key component in the field of education, from shared responsibilities for decisionmaking for their individual child's education, health and well-being, to parent participation in organizations that address community-based needs for all children. The Ohio Parent Involvement Law, Sec. 3313.472, effective July 1, 1992, requires that each Board of Education, located in the state of Ohio, adopts a policy to provide parents an opportunity to be "actively involved in their children's education." The law also states that parents must be informed of: a) the importance of parental involvement in directly affecting the success of their children's educational efforts; b) how and when to assist their children in and support their children's classroom learning activities; c) techniques, strategies and skills to use at home to improve their children's development as future responsible adult members of society. The Education Systems Change Project (ESCP), a collaborative effort between the University of Dayton and the Ohio Developmental Disabilities Planning Council, reiterates the importance of parent involvement espoused by the National PTA and the State of Ohio. As part of the project's commitment to having parents involved in the education process, this "parent handbook" has been commissioned.</paragraph><paragraph parID="819">Parent Involvement: Strategies for Success is intended to assist schools in their attempts to create opportunities for meaningful parent involvement in the education of all children. Encouraging a team approach, the project recognizes that the family is the first line of support for all children. While this lack of "parental belonging" creates a diminished educational environment for all children, it can be devastating for children with identified learning needs (typically referred to as "disabilities"). This work is a response to those who have indicated that they need more information about how to involve parents in their children's education. Materials and ideas used in this work came from administrators, teachers, parents, and students who were part of the Education Systems Change Project. Acknowledging that meaningful parent involvement is not a "one-size fits all" exercise, this work offers a variety of examples and suggestions that have been successfully used by diverse groups across the state of Ohio. The writers, ESCP Grant/ Parent Consultants, are parents of children with identified learning needs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="820">They are involved in the educational process of their children and, as such, have included additional information and insight from their own personal experiences. Research demonstrates that parent involvement improves student achievement, attitudes, homework, report card grades and aspirations according to Dr. Joyce Epstein (1995), from the Johns Hopkins University, Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning. Epstein's framework of Six Types of Involvement and Sample Practices provides the foundation for the organization of this material. The concepts presented as challenges in Epstein's framework are included in "Things to Remember" in this document. The definition of "parent," from the National PTA, includes other adults (grandparents, aunts, uncles, stepparents, guardians, etc.) that may carry the primary responsibility for a child's well-being. So, any reference to parent involvement includes the adults who play an important role in a child's family life. It is reprinted, with permission from Dr. Joyce Epstein, as Appendix B.</paragraph><paragraph parID="821">Figures are referred to throughout the text and indicate authentic examples that demonstrate an idea or strategy discussed in a particular section - if the "figures" are images, they do not appear in this text only version. They are identified by section number and placement, so "See Figure 1.1" is the first example in the first section. The "figures" that are included are found at the back of each section. Help all families establish home environments to support children as students. The single most significant factor in predicting whether a child will be successful in his or her educational process is the level of involvement of his or her parents in that process. According to the National PTA, the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning, the Parent Institute, and the US Department of Education, research shows that when parents play a positive role in their child's education, their child does better in school. Children whose parents are involved in their education are more motivated to learn.</paragraph><paragraph parID="822">Motivated students tend to be more involved in class, more concerned about homework, and more successful academically. A common problem, as indicated on parent surveys, is that parents often don't feel they know what they can do to create the environment that supports their children as students. This section, entitled PARENTING, is designed to identify and describe concrete examples that schools can implement to help all parents establish home environments that support all children as students. Following the framework of Dr. Joyce Epstein, schools can help parents develop better parenting skills by: 1) Providing suggestions and ideas for home conditions that support learning. 2) Providing grade level opportunities for parents to learn about parenting and child-rearing through workshops, videotapes and computerized phone messages. 3) Providing parent education and other courses or training for parents (e. g., GED, college credit, family literacy). 6) Initiating neighborhood meetings to help families understand schools and to help schools understand families.</paragraph><paragraph parID="823">These six areas will be addressed in more detail below. An asterix* indicates authentic examples of what parents, schools and communities are presently doing in a particular area. Conditions for Learning: Schools can help parents establish home conditions that support learning. The suggestions and ideas listed below are provided, with permission, from The Parent Institute's, Forty-Four Proven Ideas Parents Can Use to Help Their Children Do Better in School (1995). Not all forty-four of the proven ideas are listed here. Those that apply more directly to what parents can do in establishing a student-centered home environment, have been selected.</paragraph><paragraph parID="824">Time is a critical factor when it comes to parenting. Today's busy parents need to schedule time for their children and to make the most of the time they have. Schools could suggest the following as strategies to help parents make time count. Plan to eat certain meals together as a family. Mark specific times on the calendar each week when parents will spend time with their children. During that time, parents will focus love and attention on their children. Use "car time" to talk with children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="825">No one can get up and leave. Look for things to do together as a family: Get children involved in choosing how to spend "together time." A home environment that supports children as students will build their self-esteem. Schools can teach parents activities that build self-esteem in their children. Some activities could include: Look for ways to tell children what is likable about them, and that they are loved. No age limit applies to this one</paragraph><paragraph parID="826">Children model what they see, shouting or screaming, even when angry, reinforces inappropriate behavior. Use role playing to eliminate fighting and arguing between siblings. Have children present the other's point of view for five minutes. A compromise solution may be the result. Children, as well as adults, have a need to feel some control over their lives (Salomon 1989). This control is linked to the basic desire to be perceived as competent. It is particularly important for children identified as "disabled" or "underachieving," as they are permitted fewer opportunities to demonstrate a "typical" level of competency.</paragraph><paragraph parID="827">Parents can contribute to a child's sense of competence in many ways. Schools can help by providing parents with information about competence-building. This information could include suggestions such as: Children need the 4 "A's": Attention, Appreciation, Affection and Acceptance, as well as the 3 "R's. Believe every child is gifted. Helping a child see his/her giftedness is very motivating. Encourage children to read biographies about very successful people.</paragraph><paragraph parID="828">Learning about traits that made others successful can motivate imitation. Responsibility is a characteristic of personal growth. It occurs in developmental stages related to knowledge, emotion and environment (Knowles and McLean, 1986). Parent Involvement: Strategies for Success Development and publication of this document was made possible through Grant #92-1/97 which was funded under P.L. 104-183 in accordance with goals established by the Ohio Developmental Disabilities Planning Council and administered by the Ohio Department of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities. Each of the sections is followed by a brief description of the "benefits" (Epstein calls them "results") that students, parents and teachers typically experience when schools successfully implement strategies to involve parents in the educational process. PARENTING by Sue Bitsko</paragraph><paragraph parID="829">Knowledge and use of local resources by family and child to increase skills, talents or obtain needed services.

We provide information to families on how to monitor and discuss schoolwork at home. We provide information on how to assist students with skills that they need to improve. We have a regular schedule of interactive homework that requires students to demonstrate and discuss what they are learning with a family member. We ask parents to listen to their child read or read aloud to their child. We provide calendars with daily or weekly activities for families to do at home and in the community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="833">We help families help students set academic goals, select courses, and plan for college or work. Include families as participants in school decisions, and develop parent leaders and representatives We have an active PTA, PTO, or other parent organization. Parents are represented on the school's advisory council, improvement team, or other committees.

We involve parents in selecting school staff. We involve parents in revising school/ district curricula. Coordinate resources and services from the community for families, students, and the school, and provide services to the community. We provide a community resource directory which gives parents and students information on community agencies, programs, and services. We provide information on community activities that link to learning skills and talents, including summer programs for students. We work with local businesses, industries, and community organizations on programs to enhance student skills.</paragraph><paragraph parID="835">We offer after-school programs for students, with support form community businesses, agencies, or volunteers. Be sure parents understand concepts being taught to their children. Offer opportunities for parents to familiarize themselves with classroom materials and discuss grade-level curriculum. Healthy self-esteem is critical to learning. Regardless of age, the self-image makes or breaks the learning process. Schools can help build the self-esteem of parents as learners by adhering to the following guidelines: School personnel need to help parents realize their ability to learn and provide encouragement that enhances rather than diminishes self-esteem.</paragraph><paragraph parID="836">Help parents develop an "educational ladder" complete with defined goals. Courses and training will fit a purpose and self-esteem will grow whenever a goal is met. Help parents educate their children. Avoid experiences that can damage self-esteem. Schools need to be mindful of these experiences when developing courses and training sessions for parents. Ross Van Ness (1995), writing for the Phi Delta Kappa Educational Foundation, has identified experiences that damage self-esteem for all learners: Repeated negative evaluation by others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="837">Words like dumb, slow and stupid can undermine any learning opportunity. When they come from significant people, they become part of the self-image. Severe or repeated criticism. Negative humor, put-downs and humiliating kidding. These tactics are still criticism and are designed to draw negative attention to the efforts of the learner. Embarrassment. The embarrassment of a "learner" may not even be obvious to the "teacher," but it can cause severe self-blame.</paragraph><paragraph parID="838">Interpreting the learner's efforts as mistakes, errors or failures. This interpretation of less-than-completely-successful learning efforts can become an indicator of low ability, which may translate into low self-confidence. Internal messages that other people determine a person's self-worth. Because people "see" themselves reflected in the "eyes" of others, self-talk that indicates a low self-worth often lowers self-esteem. Seldom does a damaging self-esteem experience occur by itself. Most often they occur in combinations of the above. Schools need to remind adult learners that the choice of interpretation and assignment of meaning to negative events is a personal, internal process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="839">The difference between adult learners and child learners is what Van Ness identifies as a "larger reservoir of shaping experiences." Recognizing that accumulated experience may be positive or negative, Van Ness states that successful learning requires adults to frame their knowledge of themselves, as learners, in a positive light. School workshops and training sessions need to reflect the life-lessons adult learners bring to educational settings. Workshops should provide activities that emphasize "What I Do Well" and identify talents and abilities of the parent participants. All men (and women) who have turned out worth anything have had the chief hand in their own education. - Sir Walter Scott (parens added) By drawing on parents' successful accomplishments in personal and work-related areas of endeavor, trainers can translate those accomplishments to formal learning strategies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="840">Some ideas for a workshop might include: Describe the organizational skills that are needed to plan a party and compare them to the organizational skills needed to complete an educational goal. Identify the problem-solving activities utilized to solve a personal or work-related problem and identify the similarities for problem-solving activities in a workshop or training experience. Discuss goal-setting for "life" events and include educational goals. * Washington Local Schools' Student Services Department invited the chairperson of the Special Education Department of the University of Toledo to present an in-service on Increasing Self-Advocacy. The in-service was intended for, and open to, special and general educators, administrators and parents. While a critical topic for parents of students with identified learning needs, it was a relevant topic for all parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="841">Sharing in-service resources with parents capitalizes on the costs of offering in-service programs. * William Patrick Day Early Childhood Center invited all Marion Sterling Elementary School parents to a Discipline Series and Discussion Group. The six sessions were held on Friday afternoons from 1: 30 p. m. until 3: 00 p. m. The County Board of Mental Retardation/Developmental Disabilities school psychologist and a Head Start program family service worker presented the sessions. Refreshments, childcare and transportation were provided. A certificate was awarded to participants who attended at least five of the six sessions. This type of certification process could apply to the "educational ladder" referred to previously.</paragraph><paragraph parID="842">* Three Rivers Local School District held workshops on computer technology alternatives for students identified with specific learning needs. Teachers, administrators and parents were educated regarding the use of technology as a learning tool. Parents had an opportunity to familiarize themselves with state-of-the-art computer programs, while increasing their understanding of ways they can establish a home environment that more effectively supports their child as a student. By opening a workshop to parents of all students, more parents could benefit from computer training. Support Programs for Families Epstein's framework looks at how schools can help parents by directing them to needed support services, in their area. Schools should include a list of area service providers in school handbook materials.</paragraph><paragraph parID="843">Be sure to explain, in simple terms , what each provider addresses. Have service agency representatives set up displays and answer questions at pre-kindergarten assessment time so parents can access support as soon as possible. Hold a school "health fair" and invite service providers to set up booths and displays. Encourage parents to attend and to visit exhibits. * Annuciation -St. John School, in Akron, Ohio, holds a Health Fair for parents and families of the school community. As an incentive to have family members actually visit provider exhibits, they award door prizes based on a prescribed number of visits to different booths and exhibits. (See Figure 1.6)</paragraph><paragraph parID="844">The transition process is recognized as critical when it concerns a student with identified special needs. Parents should be fully involved in that collaboration and coordination. A positive, supported transition between preschool and elementary school can extend the benefits of preschool programs into the early elementary grades. Nancy Berla (1992), Director of the Help Line and ACCESS Clearinghouse of the National Committee for Citizens in Education, cites research indicating that parent involvement in a child's education during the middle years (ages 10 -14) is as important a factor in every child's success at school as it is in earlier years. Parent involvement may be more difficult, due to the middle school structure. In middle school, each student has five or six teachers and each teacher has as many as 150 students. While the teacher can light the lantern and put it in the student's hand, it is the student who must walk into the dark.</paragraph><paragraph parID="845">- William H. Armstrong Student independence is another issue that affects parent involvement in middle and high schools. Transitions to middle school, and especially high school, need to emphasize a greater degree of independence on the part of the student. One way to encourage a positive, supported transition is by involving the parent in the transition process. Collaborating with parents to identify strategies that support the student, while nurturing independence, will increase the potential for successful transition. Interpersonal (person-to-person) communication is regarded as the preferred method of communication when information is important. In addition, the communication environment is also critical to the success of the communication interaction.</paragraph><paragraph parID="846">The communication environment refers to the setting in which the communication exchange actually occurs. When people are called to the principal's office for some type of communication, they typically assume that the communication will be official and most often negative. When critical transition information needs to be communicated, the communication environment should be considered. Ensuring a positive communication environment could be as simple as finding a familiar, non-threatening place, with an opportunity for face-to-face exchanges. Since a typical, non-threatening place for most parents would be in their own homes, it seems logical, in many cases, to make home visits to address the factors related to transitions. Home visits are useful tools for gathering information about the student and the family as partners in education. See the section on COMMUNICATION for examples of forms that can help obtain needed information.</paragraph><paragraph parID="847">Berla (1992) states that, in addition to providing specific transition information, school personnel should offer the following tips to parents: Parents should let the students know that they are expected to do well in their new school situation. Parents should introduce themselves to the school principal at the first opportunity rather than waiting for a problem to arise. The school representatives making home visits should provide some suggestions as to how that meeting could occur. Parents should stay in touch with school counselors. Counselors are usually the school contact when problems develop. Parents should encourage their children to stay in touch with counselors too.</paragraph><paragraph parID="848">Parents should know how to access information on school policies and curriculum. They should know that they have the right to examine their child's records. This can be very important for reviewing information that passes on with the child at transition points. Parents should be informed about parent-teacher conferences and other meetings that may be scheduled. Home visits can alert school personnel to any communication needs that parents may have (e. g. not English speaking, transportation problems, etc.). Make sure the home visit reinforces the family members' appreciation of their role as partners in the educational process. Neighborhood Meetings to Build Understanding</paragraph><paragraph parID="849">Reiterating Epstein's words regarding the importance of neighborhood visits, the National Association of Elementary School Principals says that going into the communities is an effective strategy for involving parents. The key factor in successful programs is to take the schools to the community. - National Association of Elementary School Principals In 1955, some 60 percent of families in America included a "bread winner" father, a "stay-at-home" mother and two or three children. Don Davies (1991), of the Institute for Responsive Education, examined the relationship between poor families --often identified as more difficult to reach-- and teachers and principals. Some perceptions that would produce barriers to parent involvement were: Children whose families don't conform to middle class norms were perceived as having trouble in school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="850">Since parents of poor children were only contacted when their children had trouble, communication was viewed as negative. School personnel appeared to focus on the family weaknesses and did not look for family assets. School personnel indicated that, when it came to lack of involvement, the parents were the problem, not the schools. Who's Helping Whom? Learning begins at home. From the moment a child is born, he/she begins to learn from his parents and whether parents intend it or not, they become educators. They guide their children in learning communication skills, self-help skills, social skills and other skills that will help prepare them for school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="851">A recent "Principal" study, cited by researcher Joyce Epstein (1995) at Johns Hopkins University, says that American mothers and fathers spend very little time talking or reading to their children. What can schools do to support parents? So academically speaking, the parent becomes a support person. The role is to reinforce or enhance what is being initiated in the classroom. But without the appropriate information and support, how can a parent know what it is they should be reinforcing? Poor communication between the school and the parent can rob a student of the support he needs to be successful. Teachers and parents must form a partnership based on excellent communication to take full advantage of family involvement at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="852">Families need to know how to help at home. We know that parent involvement improves student achievement, but studies also show that when teachers guide the involvement, more parents become involved and they are involved to a greater extent with other aspects of the school. American mothers spend less than half an hour a day talking or reading to their children. Fathers spend less than 15 minutes! Principal cited by Epstein How can schools begin? Teachers can provide helpful information to parents in a variety of ways.</paragraph><paragraph parID="853">Welcoming letters to parents of kindergarten students can include activities for parents to do with their child at home to prepare them for school. Information can be very specific and tailor-made to an individual student or class. General information and suggestions can be distributed at the school level. (See Figure 4.1) As a rule, the more specific the information is to the student, the more likely it is to be used. * Parents should be made aware of the many experiences their children can learn from quite naturally. Central Elementary, in Coshocton, Ohio, encourages parents to look for "learning activities" rather than homework for their children especially for the summer months.</paragraph><paragraph parID="854">Setting the Stage Parents are partners in their child's success at school and in life. Children with concerned parents learn more quickly, enjoy school more and achieve more than children who lack that support and care. Joan Dykstra President, National PTA Administrators and teachers must know their school community before they can determine how best to get information about learning at home to parents. Every school has its "hard to reach" parents. Often they are the parents of students who could benefit from the support and involvement of their parents the most.</paragraph><paragraph parID="855">Creative techniques have been used by many schools in order to assist as many parents as possible. The following are some that have had great success. Many different types of learning activities can be placed into a "kit." These kits may contain simple learning games, videos, easy science or math activities or reading materials. Easy to read instructions or suggestions for how to use the materials are included in the kit. Clever names such as "Super Science," "Shoebox Science," and "Math Made at Home" lend the activities an air of fun rather than seeming like homework. The key is that they are projects that involve the student and the parent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="856">(See Figure 4.3 and 4.4) Expand on the above idea by including a list or brochure of community resources that are related in some way to the activity. This may be a helpful resource to parents. If the school has a lending library, include a current listing of available materials. Also, for students who are struggling, try to create goal-related activities and reference materials for the parents. Host a specific grade-level-only family night to expose parents to the curriculum for that grade or to provide suggestions to parents to help them reinforce skills related to proficiency testing. Formal student-parent workshops can be held.</paragraph><paragraph parID="857">Topics including study skills and test taking, time management, organizational skills and understanding different learning styles are especially effective when presented to the student and the parent. Encourage discussion of the impact these skills may have on homework time. A presentation on "Good, Bad and Ugly" television programs can be particularly relevant. Parents and students alike need to be aware of the benefits of educational channels and school access programming. Many also need to be reminded of the drawbacks to excessive television viewing--lack of exercise, reading practice, play and study time. Fun, informal activities held in a community setting may interest parents who typically are hesitant to attend school functions. This is especially true if the parent's own school experiences were less than ideal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="858">Those parents are often more inclined to attend a community function rather than one that is school related. Many schools offer parent workshops but often they are not well attended. Those students may also show more interest in what their parents learned at the meeting if a few written comments from the parent are part of getting the pass. Make the session topic something the parents need to know but also something the student can relate to. For example, most parents know they should read with their children at home. Help parents expand on that premise by encouraging them to talk with their child about the pictures, discuss the plot, identify the main characters or question the motives of a certain character's actions. It can never hurt to simply send suggestions home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="859">This can be done as a few comments on a weekly class newsletter, handed to a parent during conferences or sent home with the students as part of the school newsletter. * Southwest Local School District in Harrison, Ohio, sponsors an annual program in April called "Celebrate Southwest." The idea is to involve parents in educational activities with their children. Events such as "Read-Ins," family puppet shows, community tree plantings, and a district-wide road rally scavenger hunt have been successful. * Trimble Elementary, located in southeastern Ohio, sponsors family evening programs. These programs may include a speaker or several brief sessions on different topics of interest.</paragraph><paragraph parID="860">If a speaker is included, remember to offer child care and have activities for the children. The focus should remain on interactive activities for parents and children. "Make-it / Take-it" games and activities are ideal. These are easy to assemble projects that parents can do with their child. * William Patrick Day Early Childhood Center in Cleveland, Ohio, invited parents and their children to the school to assemble boxes of supplies (crayons, glue, scissors, pencils, etc.) that went home with the children. In addition to the materials, the parents had the opportunity to meet and "network" with each other. * Napoleon City Schools in Henry County held a 'Literacy Launch.</paragraph><paragraph parID="861">" Children heard a storyteller read a book at school. Then the school sent home "reading packets" that included a copy of the book with questions for parents to discuss with their child. The packet also included a couple of books on areas of interest generated by the original book. Packets are circulated throughout the student population on a rotating basis. The program is very well received and establishes guidelines for parents to help their children learn at home. Homework-Help or Headache? "I hate homework!"</paragraph><paragraph parID="862">Many students have said it. Many parents have thought it. It is the subject of many family arguments and unfortunately some parents eventually decide it is an argument not worth pursuing. They are right ... and wrong! Parents can minimize and even prevent the hassles over homework. Parents need to establish some basic rules and routines for their children and the earlier they start, the better. Turn off the television during homework time.</paragraph><paragraph parID="863">Parents should not expect their child to focus on math if the rest of the family is laughing and enjoying a favorite sit-com in the next room. Keep in mind that children are in school a long time--let them play, watch television or a video, talk with friends and relax. This is especially true for young children but all ages can benefit from a little time for unorganized activities. Learning Begins at Home Parents can set the stage for learning in everyday activities at home. Here's how: Set a good example by reading.</paragraph><paragraph parID="864">Read to your children, even after they can read independently. Set aside a family reading time. Take turns reading aloud to each other. Take your children to the library regularly. Let them see you checking out books for yourself, too. Build math reasoning skills together. Have young children help sort laundry, measure ingredients for a recipe or keep track of rainfall for watering the lawn.</paragraph><paragraph parID="865">Involve teens in research and planning for a family vacation or a household project, such as planting a garden or repainting a room. Regulate the amount and content of the television your family watches. Read the weekly TV listing together and plan shows to watch. Encourage discussions. Play family games. Show good sportsmanship. Helping parents to understand the role of "educator at home" may be a good place to start.</paragraph><paragraph parID="866">A school-age child's primary academic educator is typically the classroom teacher(s). Try a new twist to encourage students to remind mom and dad to attend. "No Homework Passes" get the attention of most students. Once the project is complete, it can be taken home and used by the family. Parents need to be involved in their student's homework but it should not be a source of tension or ill feelings. Parent involvement in school work increases student academic success and builds self-esteem. It is not as difficult as one might think.</paragraph><paragraph parID="867">Whitten, P. and Rice, J. (1996) "Parents and Schools Working Together for Students' Success." This inventory will help you identify your school's present practices for each of the six types of involvement that create a comprehensive program of school, family, and community partnerships. At this time, your school may conduct all, some, or none of the activities listed. Not every activity is appropriate for every school or grade level. You may write in other activities that you conduct for each type of involvement. The Action Team for School, Family, and Community Partnerships should complete this inventory, with input from the teachers, parents, the School Improvement Team or Council, and others as appropriate. These groups have different knowledge about all of the present practices of partnership in your school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="868">After you complete the inventory, you will be ready to write a Three-Year Outline and One-Year Implementation Plan to show how you will increase, improve, or maintain activities for each of the six types of involvement in your school. These forms are in section 5 of the "Partnership-2000 Schools Manual". Check the activities that you conduct and circle all of the grade levels presently involved. Write other activities for each type of involvement that your school conducts. However, it is useful in working on a specific goal with any child because the school and home can then reinforce each other's efforts. Provide parents with a preview of coming topics and assignments so that they can help their children be ready for that learning or activity. Create a welcoming space in the school that contains materials for parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="869">It may include books, brochures or videos on any topics in which parents have expressed an interest. Parents see school bulletin boards. They are an opportunity to share information about school projects. Photographs of children are eye-catchers. Keep a scrapbook or file throughout the year on each child containing art, photos, and written materials. Send it home at the end of the year to show progress and uniqueness. The teacher can compile the scrapbook from daily or weekly portfolios that he or she sends home to show the ongoing progress of the student.</paragraph><paragraph parID="870">Returned and signed by the parents, the samples provide accurate communication about the child's progress and upon review make preparation for conferences and report cards easier for the teacher. Responses to parental surveys, done on at least a yearly basis, reveal needs, concerns, and accomplishments. Surveys allow the school to learn how the community perceives it, can point the way to improvement, and be the basis for celebration. Notes for students to take home, when they have achieved or tried hard, provide immediate reinforcement from school and communicate the child's accomplishments to the family. Decorated postcards mailed from school to home to mark attainment of goals are a special way to make the child feel proud and to receive communication from school. Businesses may agree to redeem these recognitions for food or merchandise. Similarly, schools can favorably recognize parents who show responsibility in helping their children achieve in school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="871">Notes and computer generated awards are inexpensive ways to do this. The school or a parent can regularly send press releases, preferably with photographs, to the local newspaper to inform the entire community of the school's programs and individual accomplishments. This task could become an established volunteer position. Ensure that messages from school look inviting, non-threatening, and attractive. * Some schools in Ohio use a "child discovery form" to help parents share information that can lead to better education. * Centerville High School staff surveyed parents whose children had been in a regular education class after having been in segregated special education classes. * Huber Ridge School in Westerville, Ohio, informs parents about programs and proposed changes and seeks parent feedback, even if the program does not directly affect their own children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="872">* West Elementary School, in Celina, Ohio, communicates on school and parenting topics with books, videos, booklets, and audio tapes in a parent library. Parents receive a complete list of all the material so that they know what selections await them. Action without vision just passes the time. Vision with action can change the world. Face-to-face communication between school personnel and parents incorporates the added value of gestures, expressions and posture which all add depth to words that are spoken and listened to. Here are some examples of communications that schools have found successful. School staff and parents can improve communication by developing better listening skills.</paragraph><paragraph parID="873">We indicate acceptance and respect for one another by silently listening to the other person and creating a warm atmosphere for discussion. Phrases such as, "Tell me more about it," "I'm interested in what you think," or "Let's discuss it," indicate a desire for a working relationship based upon mutual respect. We indicate acceptance and respect for one another by silently listening to the other (Attending a workshop together on communication and listening could be an opportunity for school staff and parents to enhance their relationships.) Honor the preference of some parents for face-to-face communication over written communication. School personnel should make an effort to become well versed in oral communication styles of parents from other cultures regarding distance, volume, silences, and eye contact. Schools could provide information to their teachers about the body language signals of the sender and receiver of oral communications. Seating and room arrangement influence communication and the impression with which parents leave.</paragraph><paragraph parID="874">Assume honorable intentions and convey respect for opinions orally and visually. Provide interpreters for parents who are not fluent in English or for parents who are hearing impaired. Inform parents in advance that this service is available to them. Be sure that someone answers the school telephone promptly and in a friendly, helpful manner. Return all phone calls from parents as soon as possible and do what is necessary to ensure that parents do not feel they are getting the "run around." Teachers should try to reach each student's parents a couple of times throughout the school year (not only to discuss problems) for a brief telephone conversation. Keep a record of these calls to ensure that the teacher reaches each set of parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="875">If appropriate, teachers can make arrangements for home visits to share school information and to inform parents of ways to support their children in school. This can be an opportunity for the teacher to learn how to accommodate any special needs a child may have. Since opinions frequently differ, always look for common ground and seek a win-win outcome. There are many publications in the popular press that schools can obtain that offer guidance in negotiating. * Parents appreciate an opportunity to meet other parents. At Harrison Junior High School in southwestern Ohio, parents of returning students greet parents of new students when they come to pick-up their child's class schedule in August. * On a district and school level, planning for communication is essential.</paragraph><paragraph parID="876">William Patrick Day School developed a Classroom Family Involvement Program that includes plans for communication, building involvement, and development of rapport. Words mean more than what is set down on paper. It takes the human voice to infuse them with shades of deeper meaning. Meetings and Other Interactions Many schools are discovering that it is increasingly difficult for busy parents to attend school events. However, parent interest and attendance increase when their own children perform or when something is especially interesting to them. Establish a Parent Advisory Committee within a school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="877">Describe membership roles and their importance to all parents. This is a forum for parents to share their perceptions and expectations as well as solutions to challenges. Meet regularly to maintain communication and encourage other parents to attend. Schedule Saturday morning breakfasts for principals, teachers, and coaches to meet informally with parents. An open agenda allows for communication and feedback on all kinds of topics. Invite parents to professional development meetings. In this manner everyone receives the same message and acquires a shared foundation upon which to build in helping children succeed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="878">Provide parents with schedules of workshops and classes offered at the local Instructional Resource Center or Special Education Regional Resource Center (SERRC). Schedule meetings and conferences at convenient times for parents, based on information gathered from a feedback questionnaire, and provide child care. Allow adequate time and show respect for parental schedules by accommodating them. Hold meetings and distribute agendas to share information about the school and extra-curricular programs. Topics may include sports, child care, inclusion, support services, testing, team teaching, peer tutoring, transitions, summer opportunities, or other topics mentioned on feedback forms. Allow time for discussion and questions. Show what has been going on in art, science, or industrial arts classes by exhibiting projects at school or in exhibits that go to banks, malls, post offices, etc.</paragraph><paragraph parID="879">Obtain media coverage before and after school events. Besides academic information, provide parents with social information about their child. Conferences provide an opportunity for parents to hear about such things as their child's friends, classes, and the atmosphere of the school. Conferences should allow time for parents to share information about their children and their family culture that will help the teacher be more effective with the child. Emphasize the value and strengths of each child when communicating with parents. * Ross Middle School near Hamilton, Ohio, requests that parents pick up their child's report card during a scheduled time during the evening. * Coshocton Schools host meetings for parents to introduce teachers and parents to one another and to describe grade level and school programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="880">* Annunciation-St. John School in Akron, Ohio, offers student and parent incentives, such as no homework coupons, for parent attendance at informative meetings. (See Figure 2.6) * Trimble Elementary in Glouster, Ohio, offers a free spaghetti dinner for families, followed by a program for parents while their children are taken care of elsewhere in the school. People are held together by information and communication. James Boswell Electronic Communication</paragraph><paragraph parID="881">More people now have access to electronic equipment. Schools can utilize this in order to establish effective communications with parents while being sensitive to the absence of equipment in some homes. Parents come to learn what computer programs students use in the classroom and how they can help to follow up or individualize the activity at home. If parents have an electronic mail address, students and teachers can learn to use this method of communicating with home. Parental insights into children's needs, especially when those children have special identified needs, are invaluable to help children maximize learning. Parents need to know that the schools find them important and that they have valuable and necessary contributions to make towards the education of all children. Parents should be made aware early in the school year of the many options for volunteering available to them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="882">Some schools have a sign up sheet at an open house or at kindergarten registration where parents can sign up for activities that will take place throughout the school year. This allows parents the opportunity to plan ahead and adjust busy schedules as necessary. A survey sent to potential volunteers is a good tool for two reasons. It informs parents what volunteering options are available to them. It also is a way for schools to collect valuable information on when and in what ways parents will be able to volunteer. Parent volunteers are recognized for their work and enjoy dinner at a local restaurant. Often parents are looking for ways to contribute to the schools and be involved but the traditional avenue of participating during the school day may no longer be an option.</paragraph><paragraph parID="883">This is especially true for families where both parents work outside the home or in single parent families. Finding ways to engage these parents is a challenge facing many schools today. Asking parents to work on activities at home that will support the school and do not require large investments of time is a volunteer opportunity that can fit the schedules of many busy families. Schools can share information and programs when they host a computer night at school. * Tri-Village Local Schools create video and audio tapes to share teaching techniques and information about subject areas with parents. They send the tapes home periodically with updated information and invite recorded responses from parents. They have found this attention-getting technique to be both effective and less threatening to some parents than written materials might be.</paragraph><paragraph parID="884">Benefits when schools communicate better: Discussion can lead to a collaborative approach for improved education for all children. Effective communication can produce community support and responsibility for good schools. Students benefit when there is a unified approach and awareness about their education. Through communication, the stakeholders develop better sensitivity to the respective roles of school and home and the expectations each has of the other. School Self-Assessment on Communication Do we have formal conferences with every parent at least once a year?</paragraph><paragraph parID="885">Do we provide language translators to assist families as needed? Do we provide clear information about report cards and how grades are earned? Do we provide clear information about choosing schools, and selecting courses, programs, and activities within schools? Do we send home folders of student work weekly and monthly for parent review and comments? Do we have a homework hotline for students and families to hear daily assignments and messages? Communication is a vital skill based upon understanding the other person's frame of reference. Be inclusive, not exclusive, by genuinely welcoming all students and parents into the school culture and by using person first language.</paragraph><paragraph parID="886">Parents have an ethical and legal right to be informed and to participate in their child's education. Establish a spirit of open communication by inviting parents into the school for visits and meetings. Be creative in using electronics to communicate. For many the term "volunteer" used to mean parents (usually the mother) participating in narrowly defined jobs. These could include activities such as helping out in classrooms with holiday parties, going on field trips, or perhaps working on a school fundraiser. When volunteering did occur it was usually limited to elementary schools. For some schools and families this definition still applies and is effective and meaningful.</paragraph><paragraph parID="887">In some communities, schools and parents are re-examining the role between volunteers and the schools. Schools are beginning to recognize they can't adequately educate children without community support. Many children bring additional stresses with them to school every day. They are growing up in homes witnessing parental drug and alcohol abuse, violence, dysfunctional family systems and divorce or re-marriage. One teacher alone cannot address these societal needs. Having volunteers from the community present and active in the schools helps promote positive school activities and creates a sense of shared ownership throughout the community. Volunteers, with their range of interests, time and abilities can offer the schools assistance in meeting these increased expectations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="888">Because school volunteers have a wide range of skills to offer, this new view of volunteerism should offer a full spectrum of options for volunteers to express their talents. These opportunities may range from doing work at home to participating on school-wide or district-level policy committees. In some schools a climate of "we know best" has been created by the professionals working there. Some parents may be hesitant to challenge this attitude. * In Elyria, Ohio, Eastgate Elementary school has designated an empty classroom as the parent room/resource center for its "Helping Hands" volunteer program. The Parent Institute advises schools to remember the "one-third rule"-- if you can get one-third of a school's parents involved, you can begin to make a significant improvement in student achievement. Avenues for volunteering will be looked at through three distinct environments:</paragraph><paragraph parID="889">In the home In the classroom In the school at large In the Home Volunteers can: Prepare science materials Review text books</paragraph><paragraph parID="890">Cut out laminated materials Send in cookies, treats, etc. for parties Make phone calls through a telephone "tree" network Assemble handouts, packets, etc. Plan and arrange field trips. Some parents are hesitant to come into the school building, tentative in their role, or unsure of their skills and how they might be able to help. Working on classroom projects at home is a good way to engage these parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="891">For some volunteers this may be the most they will be able to offer the schools. For others, however, if they gain confidence in these activities, it could lead to a more direct participation in their child's classroom or the school building at large. Oftentimes parents are invited to visit the school by the teacher only as a result of something their child has done that the teacher would like to see changed. Arranging for parents to volunteer in the classroom can help create a more positive relationship. Then, when issues do need to be discussed with parents, meetings can be conducted in a climate of mutual respect and understanding. Parents also gain firsthand appreciation of the many demands placed on teachers in a typical school day. Some examples of opportunities for volunteering in the classroom are:</paragraph><paragraph parID="892">Invite the parent of a child with special needs to come into their child's class and share insights and answer classmates' questions about the child. The identified child might or might not be present, depending on the appropriateness. This type of activity can help make teachers and students more comfortable with diversity and help make the child and family feel more a part of the school community. Volunteers can work one-on-one with a child to review academic skills, reinforce concepts already taught by the classroom teacher or present materials using a different approach. * At Mason Heights Elementary, in Mason, Ohio, "The Bucket Brigade" has been created for volunteers to use in one-on-one learning opportunities. (See Figure 3.4) In this program the classroom teacher has a schedule posted stating the child's name and what area needs to be worked on between the volunteer and student. A "bucket" of materials is then utilized to address the individual needs of the student.</paragraph><paragraph parID="893">A classroom teacher can invite parents into the classroom to share their knowledge on a hobby they have, their career, or a trip of special interest. This activity can be a good way to involve fathers and working mothers who may have limited time to give to the school. Volunteers can be involved in a variety of reading activities. They can read material to students for whom the content is appropriate but the reading level is too difficult. Stories can be read to small groups of children or to the class as a whole. Students can practice their reading skills by reading to a volunteer. Using a teacher-developed checklist as a guide, volunteers can reinforce math, spelling and/ or reading skills either with small groups of students or individually.</paragraph><paragraph parID="894">* Shawnee Elementary School in the Lakota School District, West Chester, Ohio, has a second grade teacher who recruits parents and community members as story tellers. She requests that the volunteers read a specified book at home, address key ideas or concepts, and read the book to the class in an appropriate costume designed and developed by the volunteer. The teacher includes a brief list of her ideas and concepts relevant to the story when she sends the book home to the storyteller. Classroom teachers continue to rely heavily upon parents to chaperone field trips and co-ordinate class parties. * At Britton Elementary, in Hilliard, Ohio, parents are used in the school to make brief tape recordings of students reading. These tapes are sent home to update parents on their child's progress. They are also used to provide documentation of progress for the classroom teacher.</paragraph><paragraph parID="895">Further along the "continuum" for involving parents is to utilize them in school wide activities, not just in their child's classroom. Schools have used parent volunteers in the following ways: Volunteers are often eager to share a hobby, or talent with students through an after school enrichment program. Academic tutoring in an after school setting is another opportunity for volunteers. Volunteers can be utilized to coordinate and actually build lasting school projects such as constructing playground equipment, maintaining athletic fields, grounds beautification, etc. This is a particularly nice mechanism for involving grandparents in a school. * Harrison Elementary, in the Southwest School District, has a volunteer program called "6th Grade Partners."</paragraph><paragraph parID="896">This program matches adults with children who have been identified "at risk" by teachers or counselors in the school. They get together for an hour on Thursday evenings for food, projects and positive adult-child interactions. * A school-wide parent volunteer program called Helping Hands has been organized and implemented by parents at Eastgate Elementary school in Elyria, Ohio. Volunteers in this program commit to a regular period of time each week (preferably at least two times a week) that they can come into the school. A schedule of volunteer times is posted and teachers then sign up for when they would like to have a volunteer. Activities can include helping with bulletin boards, working with students on the computer, reading tests, and reinforcing academic skills. Appropriate training occurs before a volunteer begins.</paragraph><paragraph parID="897">(See Figure 3.5) School-wide activities such as fund raisers, book fairs, teacher appreciation lunches and school fun fairs are still primarily coordinated by parent volunteers. Some schools have a Volunteer Coordinator position, with a parent filling the role. A small stipend may be available ($ 500 or so), but is not always necessary. Some parents have the desire to make a difference in their child's education by volunteering in ways that impact building or district policies. * In Westerville, Ohio, at Huber Ridge Elementary parents of children on an IEP have the opportunity to do public speaking as a part of a team. The team is comprised of administrators and regular and special education teachers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="898">This team has spoken to the Board of Education, the Parent Teacher Organization as well as made district-wide presentations on the topic of inclusion. This provided a fun-filled opportunity for parents and children to participate in an activity together that had real consequences for others in the district. It also served to prevent future complaints about the cafeteria. It is becoming increasingly more evident that schools cannot effectively educate students without support and involvement from the student's home. Parents can no longer abdicate their responsibilities by not playing an active role in the life of the school community. The goal is mutual--every child getting the supports they need to be successful. The challenge lies in how to utilize the strengths both parents and professionals have in ways that are most meaningful, effective, and beneficial for students.</paragraph><paragraph parID="899">The checklist that follows this section may be of benefit as you expand your resources and capabilities and engage volunteers in your school. Benefits when schools have better volunteering programs: For Students: Gain skills in communicating with adults Increase awareness of skills and talents from a variety of adults Develop greater understanding between generations Receive more individual attention</paragraph><paragraph parID="900">For Parents: Observe ways in which teachers work with their child and learn successful techniques Appreciate and understand responsibilities of teachers and other school personnel Increase self confidence Gain understanding of own child by seeing them in relationship to and with peers Learn skills that could apply to a job such as punctuality, dependability, filing, or operating office equipment Help in meeting increased demands</paragraph><paragraph parID="901">Strengthen teaching skills Create more opportunities for communication with parents Establish rapport between teacher and parent Enrich curriculum with additional projects School Self-Assessment on Volunteering Do we conduct an annual survey to identify interests, talents, and availability of volunteers? Do we have a parent room or family center for volunteer work, meetings and resources for families?</paragraph><paragraph parID="902">Do we encourage families and the community to be involve at school by: - assisting in the classroom (e. g., tutoring, grading papers, etc.) - helping on trips or at parties - giving presentations (e. g., careers, hobbies, extracurricular events) - checking attendance - monitoring halls, working in the library, cafeteria, or other areas - leading clubs or activities - other school-specific opportunities? Do we provide ways for families to be involved at home or in the community if they cannot volunteer at school? Do we have a program to recognize school volunteers? Do we schedule plays, concerts, games, and other events at different times of the day or evening so that all parents could attend some activity? Just as students with special needs want to be included with typical peers, parents of children with special needs want to be included in typical parent settings. Don't hesitate to involve parents of children with special needs as volunteers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="903">Enroll students with special needs in their neighborhood school where siblings attend, so that a parent's time will not be spread out between buildings and districts For some parents of children with special needs, there may be additional time demands spent with doctors, therapists, tutoring, thus limiting the time they may have to give to the schools. Offer a variety of volunteering options matching volunteer time and talents with school, teacher and student needs. The degree of volunteering will vary. Recognize the value and importance of any and all volunteer contributions. Don't forget to give volunteers training when necessary concerning both job duties as well as policy/procedural issues. Areas such as confidentiality, school policies, appropriate language and dress code may all need to be addressed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="904">DON'T HESITATE TO ASK! Volunteers can be invited in to share their cultural heritage, language, and customs. In one district the Food Services Director requested volunteers, both students and parents, to taste test and rate possible new food items for the school lunch menu. Involve families with their children in homework and other curriculum-related activities and decisions. Parent and family input in this area is not only critical, it is required by law. Let them know exactly how those skills are being reinforced in the classroom so the parents can follow the same type of process at home. Share successes and "failures."</paragraph><paragraph parID="905">Include parents in school decisions, developing parent leaders and representatives. The nature of decision-making implies that at least four conditions exist for a decision to be made. The first condition is the indication that there is indeed some choice to be made. The educational environment, including school issues, is full of opportunities for parents, families and community members to contribute to the decision-making process. Even the people who have a vested interest in school decisions, namely parents, don't feel welcome in the decision-making process, according to Mathews, because they view their role as "unacceptable to professionals." Epstein addresses a fifth way to involve parents in the educational process by looking at decision-making. She stresses the importance of opportunities for parent participation in decision-making at the individual, school and district levels.</paragraph><paragraph parID="906">The following are specific categories Epstein cites as possible alternatives for using parents and families in a decision-making capacity: Create active PTA/PTO or other parent organizations, school advisory councils, or committees (e.g., curriculum, safety, personnel, and other committees) for parent leadership and participation. Promote independent advocacy groups to lobby and work for school reform and improvements. Creating opportunities for parent involvement in decision-making, for schools, requires organizations, councils, school committees and building-specific advisory and advocacy groups. The "Institute for Family-Centered Care"has developed guidelines for parent and family participation at the policy and program level. Have a basic philosophical belief in the value of parents' and families' expertise and knowledge. Have the money up front to pay for parents' and families' expenses and to provide consulting fees if that is appropriate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="907">Be aware of and open to cultural differences between parents/families, and staff. Keep families apprised of project happenings through personal phone calls and mailings. Sometimes, a mentoring one-to-one relationship between a professional and a parent works best. Show appreciation for parents' and families' roles. Maintain a feedback loop--as some parents succeed, it becomes a natural motivator for other parents. In addition to the guidelines for family participation at the policy and program level, "The Institute for Family-Centered Care" looks at parents and families as advisors. Acknowledging that there are numerous ways to receive advisory input from parents and families, "The Institute's" suggestions, listed below, may offer some new ideas:</paragraph><paragraph parID="908">Convene focus groups of parents and families as specific issues arise. Hold a monthly family/staff coffee hour. Ask parents and families to "host" a professional-in-training dinner. Solicit family input in community and program needs assessments. Include parents and families on site visit teams to other programs. Hold brainstorming sessions with parents and families before developing educational materials. Have parents and families review drafts of all written materials.</paragraph><paragraph parID="909">Include a parent/family panel during orientation for new staff. Ask parents and families to assist in translating materials. Develop, with parents and families, a parent satisfaction survey. Develop a "breakfast (or lunch) with the director" program for families. Keep a suggestion book in the waiting room, so parents and families can record their ideas. Ask parents and families to accompany staff when they meet with funders and other community groups. Invite parents and families to present at in-service programs for staff.</paragraph><paragraph parID="910">In the field of education, involvement and collaboration in decision-making roles usually implies adults. First, schools need to utilize all available human resources and students bring creativity, enthusiasm and expertise to the decision-making process. Second, educational reform goals require higher levels of student participation in their learning activities and the development of advanced thinking skills. Advocacy and decision-making use higher level problem-solving and organizational skills. Third, social skill development is a concern of educational practitioners. Students who understand and work on behalf of others develop positive social skills. Fourth, society will require collaborative skills from its members as they attempt to meet the informational needs of a global population.</paragraph><paragraph parID="911">In this position, the parent recruits volunteers for various tasks at the school, serves on building planning teams, and provides input on school issues and activities. While schools offer most opportunities for involving parents and families in decision-making activities, school districts benefit from parent involvement as well. "The Institute for Family-Centered Care" has developed the following guidelines for successfully involving parents and family members on boards, task forces and district-wide committees: Develop a plan for identifying families to participate. Support staff in developing an understanding of the value of parent and family participation. Provide convenient meeting times and locations for parents and family members. Compensate families for their time, expertise and expenses.</paragraph><paragraph parID="912">Clearly identify a staff person to be the primary contact person for reimbursement and other issues. Be sure she/he understands that timely reimbursement is essential. Provide accurate, timely, clear, jargon-free, and appropriate information prior to meetings. Provide all materials in the families preferred language. Provide clear information about the goals of the board, task force, or committee and the role of the individual members and the roles of family members. Match veteran parents with inexperienced family members to ensure that new members feel supported in their roles as advisors and have opportunity to share their new and fresh ideas. Balance membership on committees between families and professionals.</paragraph><paragraph parID="913">One family member on a committee is not enough. Ensure diversity among the membership by recruiting broadly from the community and the population the program serves. During and after meetings, specifically recognize the value of family participation. Consider incorporating a "family leave" policy so that family members can choose an inactive role but maintain their membership should family circumstances require some time off. Consider shared leadership, such as parent and professional co-chairs. Recognize that some family members may require more support than others to participate in a meaningful way. When nobody around you seems to measure up, it's time to recheck your yardstick.</paragraph><paragraph parID="914">Bill Lemley All decision making is easier when a school district shares a common philosophical framework. A district-wide policy on parent involvement at the decision-making level would ensure predictable actions on the part of district personnel. A sample policy is included (See Figure 5.3). Elected positions are an important part of district-level involvement. Schools can inform parents about vacancies on school boards or community councils, or other opportunities for a parent or family member to serve as an elected representative in school decision-making. District and school groups are enhanced when they are part of the decision-making process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="915">At the individual level, decision-making becomes an even more empowering tool. Parents share responsibility for their child's education. By involving parents in the decision-making process they become partners. * Hilliard City Schools, near Columbus, Ohio, have developed an "inter-school" PTO with representatives from all school buildings in the district. In addition to parents, the organization includes school board members, central office personnel, teachers, and community leaders. The group meets to share ideas and information, and to provide input on district decisions. * Beavercreek Local Schools, near Dayton, Ohio, has implemented a strategic planning process that brings together parents, central office staff, teachers, senior citizens, school board members, and business and community leaders who decide major goals for the school district.</paragraph><paragraph parID="916">The local newspaper provides the community with information about the committee's work in a regular feature entitled, "Focus on Education." (See Figure 5.5) Decision-Making and Identified Special Needs For all children, the following strategies for successful collaboration and decision-making apply (source unknown): Involve all stakeholders in developing a "best" plan Focus leadership Allocate time and priority to accomplish task</paragraph><paragraph parID="917">Build consensus Embrace all perspectives Communicate objectives clearly Increase involvement as decisions are made Design manageable projects and goals. In addition to strategies for effective collaboration and decision-making, there are barriers. The following obstacles need to be considered:</paragraph><paragraph parID="918">Time constraints that restrict involvement Poor leadership and uncommitted participants Incomplete stakeholder involvement Lack of activities for participants Lack of follow-through Perceived need to identify "winners" or "champions" Decision-making process sidelined by "blame-placing" and "turf-protecting."</paragraph><paragraph parID="919">Bringing parents into the educational process increases information resources for teachers and administrators. While strategies for successful individual decision-making are important for all parent/professional relationships, they are most important when they involve a student with identified needs related to a disability. These decisions often are included in the development of the Individualized Educational Plan, referred to as an IEP. Parent involvement in this decision-making process is not optional; it is required by law. There are many opportunities for parents and students to be decision-makers in the IEP development process. Some of the more important decision-making opportunities are included below (Turnbull and Turnbull, 1990): Preconference Preparation</paragraph><paragraph parID="920">Solicit information from the family about their preferences and needs regarding the conference. Discuss the meeting with the student and consider his/her preferences concerning the conference. Decide who should attend the conference. Encourage all attendees, especially parents, to visit proposed placement options prior to conference. Encourage families to discuss options with participants prior to conference. Initial Proceedings State the purpose of the meeting.</paragraph><paragraph parID="921">Ask parents if all issues have been covered. Ask if clarification of legal rights are needed. Review Student Performance Ask parents and families for areas of agreement and disagreement and corresponding reasons. Ask parents and families for input on progress and performance levels. Develop consensus about identification of learning need and performance before proceeding. Goals And Objectives</paragraph><paragraph parID="922">Elicit all participant's expectations for student's performance at home, school and in the community. Collaboratively generate appropriate goals and objectives for all subject areas. Discuss future goals and objectives based on great expectations for student. Identify objectives to expand positive contributions the student can make to family, friends and community. Prioritize goals and objectives in light of student preferences and needs. Clarify responsibility for objectives. Ask family members for input on responsibility sharing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="923">Determine evaluation procedures to be used. Discuss purpose of IEP as a guide and goal. Placement And Services Discuss benefits and drawbacks of all viable options. Identify inclusive educational opportunities. Agree on tentative placement and process to be used to confirm. Concluding Conference</paragraph><paragraph parID="924">Review any and all responsibilities for program issues. Summarize and agree on all follow-up activities. Identify the most effective communication strategies for future activities. While the strategies listed above may seem a matter of common sense, research indicates that they are not used, as a rule (Gerber et. When professionals were asked about the importance of parental input, before an IEP conference, they rated the input very highly. However, those same professionals were asked about actual parent contributions, after the IEP meeting, and ranked them very low. Seventy-one percent of the teachers agreed to an option to waive the rights of parent participation in the IEP conference and to leave all decision-making to the professionals!</paragraph><paragraph parID="925">Legal rights don't mean very much unless the system makes them meaningful. The best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas. Linus Pauling Dr. James Comer, professor of child psychiatry at Yale University, has developed a comprehensive parent-school collaborative effort, referred to as the "Comer Process" (1992). Involving parents as equal partners in a school management and planning team has created a philosophy of shared governance. Effective as a model for parent involvement, the Comer Process requires parent participation in district-level, school-level and individual-level decisions. * Baker Junior High School, in Fairborn, Ohio, engages an "Inclusion Committee" that holds open forums for discussion of issues related to including students with identified learning needs in typical classrooms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="926">* Shoreland Elementary School, near Toledo, Ohio, uses an "Inclusion/Mainstreaming Support Committee Form" to provide information, solicit parent input and assist in making decisions regarding students with identified special needs. (See Figure 5.6). * Brookpark Memorial School near Cleveland, Ohio, has developed a form that brings parents into the decision-making process for classroom placement of their children. The form identifies the parents' concerns regarding the student's placement and provides an opportunity to separate children who may cause difficulties when placed together. (See Figure 5.7) * North Elementary School, in Newark, Ohio, had teachers, parents, students and administrators form a committee to draft a behavior management plan for the school. The plan includes Staff Expectations, Parent Expectations, and Student Expectations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="927">The tri-fold document also establishes an agreed upon philosophy which must be signed by student, parent, principal and teacher at the beginning of each school year (See Figure 5.8). Benefits when schools assemble better decision-making groups: For students; For parents; Input into policies that affect their child's education. Feeling ownership of school. Awareness of school, district and state policies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="928">For teachers; School Self-Assessment on Decision-Making Do we have an active PTA, PTO or other organization? Are parents represented on the school's advisory council, improvement team or other committees? Do we have an Action Team for School, Family, and Community partnerships to oversee the development of the school's program with practices for all six types of involvement? Do we have district-level advisory councils and committees? Do we provide information on school or local elections for school representatives?</paragraph><paragraph parID="929">Do we develop formal networks to link all families with their parent representatives? Do we involve parents in selecting school staff? Do we involve parents in revising school/ district curricula? Get school, parent and community input before you begin forming decision-making groups. Joyce Epstein's sixth and final way that schools can increase the involvement of other stakeholders in the educational process is through collaborations and exchanges with the community. The concepts of busing for integration, and magnet schools for diverse learning opportunities, have reduced the level of school ownership experienced by many community members. Having students, parents and families, and school personnel visible and involved in community activities, may "put a face" on the school at-large.</paragraph><paragraph parID="930">Trained high school students can patrol streets in the near-vicinity of the school building when small children are walking to and from school. Address school and community diversity: Include parent leaders and representatives from all racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and other groups in the school. Include students (along with parents) in the decision-making groups. Provide child care and schedule meetings so that all parents can participate. Provide food --the more important the decision... the more important the food. Offer training to enable leaders to serve as representatives of other parents, with input from and return of information to all parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="931">Figure 5.1, Checklist for Involving Familise as Advisors and Consultants, The "Institute for Family-Centered Care" Figure 5.2, Arrowood's Parent Advisory Team (PAT), Arrowood Elementary School in Xenia, Ohio Figure 5.3, Parent Involvement Policy, Heather School PTA, San Carlos, California Identify and integrate resources and services from the community to strengthen school programs, family practices, and student learning and development.

Provide leave time to employees to volunteer in schools, encourage parents to take time off to participate in parent-teacher conferences, join the PTA, and provide parent resource centers. Students, parents and families are stakeholders in the community where a particular school is located. Research on parent involvement emphasizes the role of middle class status in providing access to dominant forms of cultural and social capital (Lareau, 1989; Lareau, 2003). However, parents often possess distinct forms of capital that are of value within their communities. For example, within African-American communities, church culture-including prayer, call-and-response communication, and a communal ethos-is often valued and serves as an important resource that facilitates community action (Pattillo-McCoy, 1998).</paragraph><paragraph parID="933">In particular, we focus on each group's involvement orientations and examine how they identify and activate resources to support their participation. We show that parent involvement orientations are rooted in nondominant/ethnic cultural capital (Takei, Clark, Shouse &amp; Chang, 2000), which provides parents with access to familial and community-based forms of social capital. Parents use this cultural and social capital to support their educational participation. The data for the African-American parents come from semi-structured in-depth interviews (lasting between 1-2 hours) with 18 working and middle class parents, informal conversational interviews with parents inside schools, and participant observation conducted across seven Chicago schools and communities between 1993 and 1995. Although African-American and Chinese-American parents' educational aspirations were similar, their involvement strategies were different. Although the members of both communities held high aspirations for their children, they adopted very different approaches to parent involvement. African-American parents believed strongly in home and school-based involvement and attempted to intervene inside their children's schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="934">While social class within the African-American community seemed to influence this pattern, African Americans were far more likely to seek school-based involvement than Chinese-American parents. Chinese-American parents, on the other hand, were extremely active in home-based involvement. Although they were also critical of their children's schools, they were far less likely to raise these concerns with teachers and administrators. Instead, they drew on familial and community resources to compensate for what schools lacked. We characterize the involvement of African-American parents as "front stage/activist" involvement and the involvement of Chinese-American parents as "back stage/behind the scene." These differences in involvement result from the racial and cultural distinctions between these groups. We argue that cultural models that emphasize getting ahead through collective struggle inform African-American parents' involvement strategies (Fordham &amp; Ogbu, 1986; Fordham, 1996).</paragraph><paragraph parID="935">The Chinese-American parents were engaged in cultural practices that honored the professional expertise of teachers and the need to access skills for successful access to social mobility while at the same time they sought to maintain the cultural integrity of their communities. Nondominant/ethnic cultural capital can provide access to parent involvement resources (social capital) within minority communities. These resources allowed parents to make needed educational investments (e.g., books and school materials), freed up their time to volunteer inside schools, and provided parents with access to supplementary educational activities for their children outside of schools. Among both working class Chinese-American parents and African-American parents, social networks, including extended kin and co-ethnic friends, helped compensate for limited money and time for educational participation. In addition, communal child-rearing orientations among African Americans allowed multiple adults to influence children's education and to reinforce parental expectations for behavior and academic achievement. View parents' distinct involvement strategies as a reflection of their cultural styles rather than their levels of investment in education. Recognize the nondominant/ethnic cultural capital of parents as valuable and seek to build on it to create stronger connections between schools and communities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="936">Recognize school-based expectations of parents as one set of cultural beliefs (among several) about the appropriate role of parents in education.

Involvement of Parents of Diverse Cultural and Linguistic Backgrounds Parent involvement is consistently cited as an important correlate of effective schools. For nearly a quarter of a century, research on parental and family involvement has documented that parents can do much to reinforce positive attitudes toward school, to prepare their children for school, and to support their children's efforts once they are in school. Unfortunately, not all parents have the same level of participation in school-home collaborations. In spite of an increase in efforts to boost participation of culturally and linguistically diverse parents there is still a lack of systematic efforts to include these parents effectively. What follows is a summary of critical issues and promising practices in the Mid-Atlantic region.</paragraph><paragraph parID="938">Critical Issues &amp; Statistics New demographic patterns: As of 1994, one in every three children nationwide were from an ethnic or racial minority group; one in seven children spoke a language other than English at home; and one in fifteen children were born outside the U.S. (Garcia, E., 1994). Culturally and linguistically diverse students, particularly Latino students, are more likely to experience school failure when compared to white students: Latino and African American children are far more likely to experience school failure than are white children. Analysis of desegregated data of the National Assessment of Educational Performance (NAEP), illustrate the large gap between the performance of white children and their Latino and African American counterparts (NAEP, 1994). We need to rethink ways to address this challenge drawing upon what we know works and modifying it when necessary to meet the needs of culturally diverse students. To do this, we need to look at the many indicators and factors that have an impact on student achievement. Among these factors is parental involvement.</paragraph><paragraph parID="939">Numerous research studies show the positive impact of home-school partnerships and parental involvement on student achievement. There is no doubt that when parents become involved with the education of their children, students not only become more motivated to achieve but actually achieve significantly better (Epstein 1991; Griffith. Wade, &amp; Loeb, 1997; Shaefer, 1972; Walberg, 1984). The Need to Involve Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Parents There is evidence that family practices concerning children's education are more important for helping students succeed in school, and in general, than are family structure, economic status, or characteristics such as race, parent education, family size, and age of child. According to these studies, children tend to do well in school when their parents express high expectations for school achievement; stress the value of schooling; conduct warm, nurturing and frequent interactions with their children; and encourage a purposeful use of time and space (Chavkin, 1989; Clark, 1983; Schiamberg &amp; Chun, 1986). In a longitudinal study of seven Chicano families in Southern California, Villanueva (1996) found that Latino families were able to provide support and have an impact in their children's education in spite of a lack of formal schooling, limited knowledge of English, and lack of skills to help their children with homework.</paragraph><paragraph parID="940">She found that despite these limitations, families motivated their children to do well in school by providing them with cultural practices that fostered a positive attitude towards work and responsibility and the importance of education. The following additional benefits are found in the research of parental involvement and parents of diverse backgrounds: increased language achievement, (Bermudez &amp; Padron, 1989; Henderson &amp; Garcia, 1973); improved overall school behavior (Levenstein, 1974; Weikhart. improved parent-child relationships (Henderson, 1988); improved home-school relationships (Bermudez &amp; Padron, 1987, 1988; Oakes. 1990; Herman &amp; Yeh, 1980); and</paragraph><paragraph parID="941">decreased drop out rates (Delgado-Gaitan, 1990; NiThez, 1994). Additionally, it has been documented that meaningful parent participation results in benefits to parents and children that extend beyond the individual school. Parents who participate in joint efforts with schools, develop increased self confidence, have more positive attitudes towards schools and staff, help gather support in the community for their schools, and enroll in other educational programs (Becher, 1984; Chavkin, 1989; Cummins, 1986). Existence of Barriers That Inhibit Latino Parents' Participation Linguistically and culturally diverse parents face barriers that make their interactions with schools particularly challenging. Some of the common barriers that these parents face include: work interference;</paragraph><paragraph parID="942">lack of confidence interacting in a culture different than their own; lack of English language skills; insufficient information on home-school collaboration and/or partnerships; different expectations of the school role; and Although these barriers might affect parents differently according to parents' personal backgrounds and characteristics, (socio-economic status; educational level; ethnic backgroun&amp; country of origin; knowledge of English language and level of understanding of the U.S. school system and specific types of schools), they continue to be commonly attributed barriers to the involvement of culturally and linguistically diverse parents. Existing Barriers Perceived by School Personnel Since successful partnerships between schools and communities require providing tools to both school staff and parents, attention must be paid to the barriers that are closely related to involving culturally and linguistically diverse parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="943">Culturally and linguistically diverse parents are many times blamed (consciously and unconsciously) by teachers, administrators, and mainstream parents for their children's failure to succeed in school. In addition, teachers and administrators have cited the following barriers to effective communication with parents: fear and distrust of different cultures and life styles lack of an understanding of the home language endorsement of negative stereotypes (e.g. parental apathy); and lack of formal training in dealing with culturally and linguistically diverse parents (Bermudez, 1989). Need for Mechanisms to Effectively Deal with Tensions That May Arise From the Active Participation of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Parents</paragraph><paragraph parID="944">Tensions between parents and schools are to be expected in many different stages of forging partnerships (Ochoa, in press). Tensions may actually occur as a result of empowering initiatives of the school designed to promote equal partnerships. It is important that schools prepare themselves to approach these tensions as a positive step that will allow a better dialogue between school and homes. Promising Trends in the Mid-Atlantic Region: When Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Parents are Reached, the Response is Overwhelmingly Positive School-home experiences in Montgomery County Schools in Maryland, show that when culturally and linguistically diverse parents are reached, they respond in very positive ways. In 1997, Montgomery County Public Schools conducted an evaluation of family -school partnerships initiatives in sixteen elementary schools in Montgomery County (Griffith et al., 1997). The main purpose of the study was to determine how well family-school partnerships were implemented in the participating schools and to assess how well these initiatives have accomplished their goals.</paragraph><paragraph parID="945">Partnership activities were conducted under a four-year grant from the U.S. Department of Education through Family Works , a collaboration between Child Care Connection -- the child care resource and referral agency for Montgomery County-- and Montgomery County Public Schools. One of the questions of the study was to find out if parents targeted for parent involvement actually reported greater familiarity and use of the school-family partnership initiatives. The target populations included parents having children enrolled in lower grade levels and parents of African American and Latino racial/ethnic identification. The primary data sources for this study were survey questionnaires that included items that addressed Epstein's six levels of parental involvement. Results indicate that in spite of the fact that Latino and African American parents were generally less likely than other parents to have experienced family-school partnerships, when they did experience a partnership, their response was overwhelmingly positive. Specifically, findings indicate that when reached, the effect of the family-school partnership on both parent involvement and student achievement was greater for African American and Latino parents and students than for white parents and students. Furthermore, Latino parents reported significant changes in their parent involvement activities from the previous to the current year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="946">In fact, they reported the largest increases in attending activities to help with their children's school work and to know what their children were being taught, as well as helping in their children's classrooms and attending PTA meetings. Finally, results of the evaluation also indicate that parent involvement activities had a greater effect on Latino families (10 percent of the variance) than it had on Asian Americans (5 percent) and whites (4 percent). Recommended Policies: Nationwide, we are beginning to witness a variety of promising changes and trends in the attitudes and the perception of school personnal and culturally/linguistically diverse parents towards each other. As a nation however, we still need to devote time and effort to promote and develop systemic and effective school-home partnerships between schools and culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Move beyond a piecemeal approach. States in the region need to develop policies that encourage and enable school districts and schools to promote successful school-home partnerships that are responsive to the diverse populations they serve.</paragraph><paragraph parID="947">Train teachers at the undergraduate and graduate levels to recognize the importance of parental participation and to gain cross-cultural skills needed to make this partnership work. Principals and teachers need to develop knowledge and appreciation of their students' cultures. They also need to learn how to establish a continuous communication process with the families so that parental involvement at different levels can be achieved. Provide training to Latino parents on how to best use their talents to help their children succeed in schools. We also need to provide them training on how to develop additional skills to improve their communication and effectiveness with their children and with their schools. Finally, efforts should focus on moving from more traditional parental involvement activities to establishing true partnerships in which both school personnel and parents learn from each other and find ways in which they can mutually support their efforts of educating children. Paper presented at the 1998 Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association Symposium Empowering Latino Families and Students to Overcome Structural Barriers that Inhibit their Academic Achievement, San Diego, CA, April, 1998.</paragraph><paragraph parID="948">In Mid-Atlantic Equity Center (Ed.) The reform effort was called Alaska Onward to Excellence and took place in small, isolated rural communities spanning western, central, and southeast Alaska. Case studies of seven of these communities examined how school-community partnerships are formed and sustained so that educational reform can become a more stable endeavor that ultimately benefits all students. A cross-case analysis, conducted by research teams including university and regional laboratory researchers, school practitioners, and community members, resulted in four key findings. First, reform efforts in small communities require an inside-out approach that starts with existing community relationships, builds trust across groups, and designs reforms around local place, language, and culture. Second, parent involvement requires a deeper understanding of new parent roles by both parents and teachers, and strong proactive efforts to engage parents rather than simply invite parents to participate in the school's agenda. A third essential ingredient for successful partnerships is moving from top-down to shared leadership so that the ownership and commitment for school change is embedded in the community rather than with school personnel who constantly come and go.</paragraph><paragraph parID="949">Finally, educational improvement and community health are overlapping goals in small communities; schools need to focus not only on academic standards, but also integrate strong cultural standards for indigenous people, along with character goals and life skills that can lead to making a life as well as a living. Especially strong bonds are forged through the cultural heritage of the Native people for whom rural Alaska is home, and who view their world as a unity of the human, spiritual, and natural realms (Kawagley, 1995). This study examines how two related reform mechanisms-community engagement and parent involvement-are being used in rural Alaska to change this historical pattern and achieve a more unified educational system The dynamics of community engagement and parent involvement are examined, including the factors that help and hinder school-community partnerships, and the changes that result when school and community work together. While rural Alaska is in many ways a unique place, there are lessons from this study that can be applied to rural schools anywhere, particularly those serving indigenous people. Instead it represents a long-term investment in building ownership, capacity, and "social capital" for deeper changes in educational policy and practice. In poor rural areas, community engagement is especially important because public schools are often the most visible and accessible institutions for bringing people together around community concerns. School-family partnerships are especially beneficial in leveling the effects of poverty by helping parents, teachers, and students in impoverished communities develop coordinated strategies that lead to high expectations for educational attainment as well as constructive learning habits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="950">Successful partnerships can transcend the effects of poverty and social class by capitalizing on a strong sense of caring for children shared by parents and teachers even in the most impoverished communities. This is particularly true in communities where parents have felt disenfranchised because of race, culture, or poverty. Successful partnerships not only depend on how welcome parents are made to feel by the school, but on parental beliefs about their role in the educational process. Parent expectations about their involvement also depend on their own sense of efficacy. Parents with low educational attainment, for example, often see a very limited role for themselves in helping their own children succeed in school (Hoover-Dempsey &amp; Sandler, 1997). The Alaska Quality Schools Initiative was picking up steam as a state-driven reform effort stressing high learning standards, assessment benchmarks, improving the quality of teachers, and school-family partnerships. Within the last decade alone, rural education in one corner of the state or another has been subjected to variations of mastery learning, Madeline Hunter techniques, outcome-based education, total quality learning, site-based management, strategic planning, and many other imported quick fixes to long-standing endemic problems, right up to the current emphasis on high standards.</paragraph><paragraph parID="951">Percent of Parents and Teachers Who Rate Various Parent Involvement Activities as "Very Important" (Klawock Survey). Sidebar 3 When Two-Way Communication Breaks Down Klawock Study/Jim Kushman Parents in Alaska Native communities can feel marginalized because of poverty, a sense of cultural isolation, or their own negative experiences with schools, both past and present. The story of Bill (not his real name), an Alaska Native single father with two school-age children, illustrates how deep the barriers to trust can become when parents and schools fail to understand each other and actively communicate. Bill characterized his own education in a boarding school as "a place where 90% of the teachers didn't care if students passed or not," but was generally positive about the present-day teachers in this community's school and their caring for students. Difficulties do persist, however.</paragraph><paragraph parID="952">Bill pointed out that it is difficult for many Alaska Native parents to work with the schools because they do not understand what the teachers are doing. Bill felt that he certainly could not help his daughter with her middle-school math since he only had a ninth-grade education himself. He firmly believed that it is not the parent's role to teach academic subjects: "I run my business, I'm not a teacher, I can't come into the school and teach math!" Bill was most concerned about his 11 year-old son Sam who was in special education. He characterized Sam's experience in the regular classroom as the teacher "giving him five problems to work on while the other kids get 20 problems." The other kids excel and Sam falls behind. Bill said he has gone to the school and talked to many people about Sam's problems-teacher, principal, superintendent, and finally the school board-but to no avail.</paragraph><paragraph parID="953">"I go down there, I tell them what's on my mind, I get no response; then I get angry and communication shuts down." Bill expressed his anger and confusion at this sudden shift in policy, with no real explanation or help coming from the school. Given his past experiences in school, his low sense of efficacy as a parent educator, and the insensitivity he experienced over his son's problems it is no surprise that Bill felt deeply alienated. Yet in the abstract, he firmly believed that schools and parents must work together through community-based processes like Alaska Onward to Excellence. Many parents in Quinhagak are now directly involved in their school because they are serving as the school's teachers, aides, cooks, custodians-and principal. Several community members serve their school in other positions. Those on the Advisory School Board deal with matters ranging from setting the school calendar to approving changes in the school's bilingual programs to assisting in establishing budget priorities to annual approval of the school's principal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="954">The AOTE process also provides opportunities for community members to serve on leadership teams and broader participation through its community-wide meetings and potlucks. Other venues for direct participation include the Village Wellness Committee Team and the school Discipline Committee. Others contribute through efforts in their own homes (e.g., providing a quiet place for children to study, reading with and to children, reviewing homework assignments with them). A description of 15 initiatives that were designed to promote increased parent, family, and community involvement and participation in the school were identified by the school in 1997. There were 119 volunteers and 1,500 hours of volunteer services in 1997-98. The 15 initiatives included: Let's Learn Together: Program that rewards parents, siblings, or community members who volunteer at least 10 hours in the school during the academic year with a T-shirt with the words "Let's Learn Together-Quinhagak, Alaska" in both Yup'ik and English.</paragraph><paragraph parID="955">These shirts are available only from the school and are worn with pride. Home-school journals: Students write weekly letters or notes to parents or other older family member and receive a written reply. Journals are also used for parent and teacher written correspondence. Migrant education program: Federal money is used to hire community workers who visit students and their parents in their homes during non-school hours to provide assistance with reading for both students and their parents. While there continues to be some significant differences of opinion regarding how to proceed in integrating the Yup'ik culture with the standard academic curriculum, the comment of one of the teachers that their task is to help students "walk in two worlds with one spirit" best signifies the direction that has begun to emerge. For the majority of the teachers who originate from outside the communities and culture in which they are working, such a task poses a major challenge, but as a result of the AOTE dialogue they saw the need and were willing to make the effort. Instead of the community having to make all the accommodation to meet the imported expectations of the school, at least one teacher was encouraged that "the school is finding its way to the community."</paragraph><paragraph parID="956">The Yupiit School District (YSD) experience indicates that it is possible to approach the infusion of culturally appropriate content and practices into the curriculum through an integrative rather than an additive or supplementary approach. When the senior researcher asked the residents to describe any factors that have contributed to school change and improvement, most shared their viewpoints first and foremost on the importance of the [two husband and wife] teachers. They called students stupid and hopeless. Alaska Onward to Excellence might be improved if it began with a core group of motivated individuals from each village that spends time identifying key community networks and individuals who can positively influence the community and school. Classroom-level examples of the kinds of communication necessary for engaging and sustaining such relationships were discovered during interviews with teachers and parents The common pattern across these examples reflects teachers going out of their routine roles to interact with parents and community members in ways that demonstrate genuine caring for students and an understanding of local context and place. To varying degrees, the individual case studies showed how a reform process like AOTE, which includes concrete ways for the school and community to continuously work together over the long-term, can be a powerful tool for change. The community of Tatitlek, for example-located near Valdez with about 100 residents, 23 students, and a husband and wife teaching team-demonstrated how teachers who came from the outside gained the trust of the community by taking the time to understand the community's traditions and heritage and use this knowledge to create meaningful educational experiences for the students (see sidebar, It's All About Teachers )</paragraph><paragraph parID="957">An important lesson learned in these communities is that too much emphasis can be put on process and procedure from the outside and not enough on building relationships and trust from the inside. The Aniak-Kalskag case study in western Alaska found that to be effective, an external process like AOTE needs to work from within the local context and build on the relationships that already exist (see sidebar, Working From the Inside-Out ). This inside-out approach can lead to sustained community engagement and ownership for the reform work. In contrast, when personal relationships with key village leaders and residents were not nurtured as part of the reform process, a familiar pattern emerged throughout the case studies-fewer and fewer community people participated in AOTE-sponsored reform activities as time went on. Vignettes in some of the case studies illustrate the extent to which Alaska Natives continue to feel alienated from the school system (see sidebar, When Two-Way Communication Breaks Down ). Those words represent a larger finding of the case studies: while it is easy to talk about creating partnerships between school and community, changing the traditional roles, behaviors, and attitudes is a difficult process for both school personnel and parents. Some of the communities were stuck in what Joyce Epstein (1995) calls the "rhetoric rut" in which both school personnel and parents talk about and support the idea of parent/community involvement but do not know how to get there.</paragraph><paragraph parID="958">A parent survey conducted by the case study team from Klawock in southeastern Alaska (an island town with about 750 residents and 200 K-12 students) illustrates how both parents and teachers see limited roles for parent involvement. Survey items used Epstein's (1995) parent involvement framework and asked parents and teachers to rate the importance of twelve specific parent involvement activities in five categories: parenting (help families establish home environments that support learning), communicating (effective school-to-home and home-to-school information sharing), volunteering (parents helping in classrooms and the school), learning at home (helping parents guide children through homework and projects), and decision making (including parents in school decisions and school improvement efforts like AOTE). Teachers tended to agree here with parents. By carefully delineating the knowledge, skills and values students are to learn in culturally appropriate terms, and employing a variety of "teachers" who possess the necessary local and global cultural knowledge and perspectives, it is possible for a school district to provide an integrated educational program that builds on the local cultural environment and indigenous knowledge base as a foundation for learning about the larger world beyond. The impact of the AOTE project on schooling in YSD is best captured by the statement of a parent in summarizing the significance of the mission statement that had been adopted by the YSD board with a paraphrase of an old African adage: "It takes the whole village to educate a child." The survey asked parents if they were involved as much as they would like to be and 70% answered "yes." The parent survey results were analyzed by race to see if there were differences between non-Native and Native parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="959">Schools Must Understand and Practice Shared Leadership Second, parents and school personnel are often locked into a view that the home and school are separate spheres of influence, to use Joyce Epstein's (1995) terminology. Sidebar 6 Helping Rural Students Make the Transition Tatitlek Study/Sarah Landis Anchorage House was designed by the Chugach School District to provide village students with opportunities to receive skills training, explore after-graduation options, and apply their learning in real-life situations. To accomplish this purpose, the district has purchased two houses in Anchorage at which village students stay while engaged in learning activities in the following areas: life skills, personal development, social development, service learning, urban familiarization, and career development. Activities are organized around exploration in five outcome areas: entrepreneurial, business, postsecondary education, service learning, and skilled trades.</paragraph><paragraph parID="960">Students attend Anchorage House in phases: Phase 0: Introduction to Anchorage House is intended for younger kids (middle school) to introduce them to Anchorage House and get them started in the program. Phase 1: Search Week lasts for approximately one week. During this time, many of the activities focus on self-awareness, problem solving, trust, conflict resolution, resiliency, team building, urban understanding, and exposure to a variety of career and postsecondary choices. Phase 2: Earn to Return is about one month in duration (broken up into two visits) and offers opportunities for successful, dedicated graduates of phase 1 to act as facilitators with other students. At the end of the phase, students are able to look for and secure a job, use resources for counseling and personal finance, live independently, eat, clean, and travel on their own, and have a good understanding of areas they wish to pursue. Phase 3: Pathways provides an opportunity for "independent" living and emphasis on life after high school by engaging students in various career exploration and internship programs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="961">For approximately one month, students are supported to enable them to move toward independent learning while they are also given a more in-depth exposure to what career settings require and employers expect. By the end of phase 3, students are responsible, self directed, and have a good understanding of where they wish to spend their time for phase 4. Phase 4: Create Your Future is a 6-to-12 month supervised, self-directed, independent living and learning experience. The students who have completed the prior phases and have been successfully matched with an employer, institute or small business start up will gain specific technical skills, and/or college credit, through hands-on learning, closely integrated with school-based activities. Respondents were also asked to consider a number of factors that might hinder parent involvement. Not surprisingly, the most inhibiting factor for parents was time and scheduling-this item was checked by nearly two-thirds of the parents, the majority of whom were "working" rather than "at-home" parents. Beyond the time issue, an important inhibiting factor for many parents was that they didn't know what their options were to become more involved in the school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="962">This mirrors the earlier parent concern, "I don't know how I am supposed to have a voice." Interestingly, teachers cited the most inhibiting factor as parents not feeling comfortable coming to the school. What teachers saw as "discomfort" may have been a reflection of parents not knowing what their options were. All of the analyses revealed similar views and opinions across racial groups. Native parents felt just as comfortable coming to the school as non-Native parents, and if anything were less likely to endorse the statement, "I don't think the school is interested in my involvement." Native and non-Native parents also had similar patterns in their role conceptions-they saw themselves more as good parents supporting education in the home than as classroom volunteers or school decision makers. These results reveal challenges many small rural communities may face when trying to bring school and community together.</paragraph><paragraph parID="963">Beneath the rhetoric of greater parent involvement are beliefs about when and how parents should be involved. In this one small community, parents and teachers saw the parent role as being good parents and promoting learning at home, which are very important factors for student success. But absent were conceptions of more expanded parent roles that characterize partnerships-parents as school volunteers, decision makers, and active participants in improvement work. Without a compelling goal deeply rooted in community values, such as preserving language and cultural knowledge in Alaska Native communities, many parents and community members may be content to leave education to the educators. In contrast to Klawock, the western Alaska community of Quinhagak (consisting of about 550 residents, many of whom are fluent Yup'ik speakers, and 125 K-12 students) exhibited a strong sense that the school belongs to the community-as evidenced by the school's name, Kuinerrarmiut Elitnaurviat, which few non-Yup'ik speaking people are able to pronounce. Quinhagak illustrated how parents, elders, and other community members could work in the school as paid workers, as unpaid volunteers, and as educators in the home. Given a strong commitment by everyone to the goal that students will be educated to speak both Yup'ik and English, community members were certainly made to feel they had important knowledge to offer the formal education system.</paragraph><paragraph parID="964">The Quinhagak case study exemplified that with energy and creativity, many new roles can be constructed for parents and community members to become involved in the school when there is a shared goal that reflects success in both the school and community (see sidebar, There Are Many Ways for Parents to Become Involved ). Through this strong parent-school partnership, Quinhagak and the Lower Kuskokwim School District have built an exemplary bilingual program for Alaska Native students. The case studies provided multiple examples of reform led by strong superintendents and principals who provided the leadership necessary to keep the improvement process moving forward. However, strong leadership from the top is not enough, and in fact can sometimes hinder rather than help a community-guided reform process. The important distinction here is between leadership as a shared decision-making process and top down leadership that invites community input rather than full community engagement. Districts and villages with a tradition of top down management had difficulty making a transition to shared decision making. District and school leaders need to clearly understand that with a community-driven reform process, they are buying into a different way of making educational decisions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="965">Furthermore, when a district buys into shared decision making, it must follow through on its commitment and not choose to exercise veto power just because a decision didn't adhere to the administrative position. A community will quickly sense when district leaders are not "walking the talk," and this will seriously erode trust. Yet the case studies also attest to the limitations of top down leadership and illustrate how shared leadership helps districts and communities sustain reforms. Shared leadership creates the high degree of community involvement and ownership that can sustain educational reform despite the frequent superintendent and principal turnover that occurs in rural Alaska schools. In the community of Tatitlek, where most of the leadership at the time came from the superintendent, there was little evidence of shared responsibility for student success. Once the community provided input to the mission and goals, there was little further interest in being involved because changing educational practice was viewed as school work led by a strong superintendent rather than school-community work. Many innovative changes in curriculum, instruction, and assessment were in fact implemented by the superintendent, but with little further involvement by the village council and community members-even for things like cultural fairs, which require a high degree of school-community collaboration.</paragraph><paragraph parID="966">A point of contrast to the superintendent-oriented leadership apparent in Tatitlek and the Chugach School District was Quinhagak and the Lower Kuskokwim School District (LKSD), where shared leadership coupled with shared responsibility has been consciously practiced for many years. Shared decision making is part of the organizational culture at the district office and throughout many village schools in LKSD. In the case study site of Quinhagak, the real reform was exercising local control of education. The external reform model-in this case AOTE-was merely a means to this end. In 1995, LKSD embraced AOTE as a way to move from traditional district strategic planning to the district working with schools and local communities to share decision making and responsibility for student success. This fit nicely with an established district practice of using the local school advisory committees for more than just giving advice. Advisory committees are involved in core decisions, such as how the school budget would be spent, the kind of educational programs that would be put in place, and selection and retention of the school principal.</paragraph><paragraph parID="967">The district invested in training local advisory board members in areas like the school budget so that they would have the capacity to make sound decisions. This is true shared decision making rather than the rhetoric of shared decision making. Coupled with the strong district support for the Quinhagak bilingual program, which the community truly embraced, a long-term partnership has emerged involving district leaders, school leaders, and community leaders who work together and share responsibility. The Alaska case studies focused on understanding how rural districts, schools, and communities can work together to achieve greater educational attainment for this generation and future generations of students who must "walk in two worlds with one spirit." Another important theme generated from the case studies is that education in rural Alaska has a larger purpose than teaching academic skills and knowledge. The AOTE community-based process brought out the deeper hopes, dreams, and fears of communities that are trying to preserve their unique identity and ways of life while still preparing their children to live in a global and technological world. The AOTE vision-setting process resulted in as many community wellness and character education goals as academic goals.</paragraph><paragraph parID="968">People expect the education system to help young people respect their elders, respect themselves, stay sober and drug free, learn self-discipline, and contribute to the well-being of their community. Some schools and communities tried to achieve a broader definition of "educational reform" than narrow academic goals, and some saw academic goals as a means to community wellness rather than an end in itself. There was a clear sense that education and community health are inextricably linked. Schools and communities in rural Alaska are challenging themselves to simultaneously achieve high cultural standards and high academic standards as a means to improved community health (see sidebar, Reform as a Means to Bridge Two Worlds ). Finally, education is ultimately a means to prepare students for making a life and a living both inside and outside of the village. These communities realized that there are many pathways to success and that schools must prepare, encourage and support students in whatever path they choose. The Alaska case studies of educational reform point to many hopeful signs that rural schools and small communities can work together for the benefit of all young people.</paragraph><paragraph parID="969">When parents, elders, community members, and school personnel begin to see that they share something in common, they do come together. In the communities studied a shared vision for student success with explicit learning goals was created through the Alaska Onward to Excellence process, which included a series of scripted community meetings that brought community members into the conversation. In rural Alaska, this vision was typically to develop young people who "can walk in two worlds with one spirit," to quote a teacher from one of these communities. The goal was to educate students who are literate in their own Native language and subsistence culture, and likewise are prepared to read, write, compute, think, and live successfully in the world outside of rural Alaska. This continues to be a challenging goal in these communities, but one which people adhere to through the many setbacks and personnel changes of multi-year reform efforts. Establishing a vision that the school and community share is a good start, but it is not enough. The cross-case analysis points to at least four essential characteristics of successful, sustainable partnerships.</paragraph><paragraph parID="970">First, small rural communities are built on interpersonal relationships more than on formal processes. Reform efforts will be more successful if they take an inside-out approach and build on these relationships. This means seeking out the strengths, assets, and local sense of place and culture that make a small community unique, and then designing a reform effort that fits this context. This is a different style than working strictly from an external reform model that includes many prescribed steps and often starts from a framework of untested assumptions or perceived community deficits. An important step in this approach is consciously building good relationships among school personnel, parents, elders, and non-parent community members - groups who often start out with a degree of mistrust, ill-feelings, and misconceptions. Relationship-building requires constant two-way communication between the school and community, including communication through the informal people networks in small villages and towns. It takes more than just talking about the need and importance of parent involvement to unfreeze this mindset.</paragraph><paragraph parID="971">Parents must learn new roles and teachers need to change their views about how parents should be involved. It is easy for teachers and parents to become locked into blaming each other for low parent involvement. This blaming is due in part to the frustration that naturally occurs when people are asked to change old attitudes and behaviors. In Alaska Native communities, the last generation of adults was given the clear message that their knowledge, culture, and language had no place in the school. The message has changed but it will take time and effort for people to become comfortable and skillful in exercising new parent roles in which they share decision making responsibility. Schools also need to move beyond a few narrow parent involvement options and make accommodations for parents with busy schedules, different backgrounds, and different comfort levels. Too often, parent involvement is viewed as a one-way street whereby parents are expected to be the passive supporters of the school's agenda.</paragraph><paragraph parID="972">The lesson from these case studies is that parent involvement must be seen as a two-way partnership in which parents and teachers work hand in hand to make what students experience in school and the life they lead outside of school complementary. This is especially crucial in Alaska Native communities where the language and culture of the community need to provide the foundation for the school curriculum and teaching practices. However, the more that leadership is shared with the community and teachers, the more a reform effort will likely become part of the community fabric instead of the latest fad of the current administration. People in rural Alaska have seen numerous school reform initiatives come and go over the years, only to be replaced by a recycled initiative under a new name with each new principal or superintendent (or legislature) seeking to make his or her mark on the educational landscape. The purpose of the reforms must be clear and widely supported if they are to last beyond the tenure of the current proponents. Reform for reform's sake has no durability and is likely to become an obstacle to meaningful long-term change. These are overlapping goals for small rural communities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="973">Schools have an important role in community development and educators should work to develop educational programs that not only address high academic standards, but that promote high cultural standards for Native groups and help students develop the respect, self-esteem, and other character goals that contribute to academic success. Students in rural Alaska are often caught in a tug of war between their identity as members of the indigenous culture and the pervasive influences of the outside world, particularly as manifested in the school and on television. In the current frenzy over high academic standards, the focus of schools becomes limited to academic development alone and as a result, risks contributing to disaffection, aimlessness, and alienation among students in rural Alaska. Guidelines for overcoming this limitation of schooling have been spelled out by Native educators in the Alaska Standards for Culturally Responsive Schools. Following are the main points put forward by the Alaska Cultural Standards to address this issue. Culturally knowledgeable students are well grounded in the cultural heritage and traditions of their community. Culturally knowledgeable students are able to build on the knowledge and skills of the local cultural community as a foundation from which to achieve personal and academic success throughout life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="974">Culturally knowledgeable students are able to actively participate in various cultural environments. Parents' attitudes and practices of involvement in inner city elementary and middle schools. When tied to student school day learning, family arts programs strengthen student support systems and bring parents of different backgrounds together who might otherwise limit their in-school involvement due to barriers of language, culture or work commitments. Schools that have struggled with very low parent involvement have reported that previously uninvolved parents who attend a PAAP program often begin to attend PTA meetings and other school events. "In addition to providing a high quality arts program, CAE will be leading workshops for parents and participants to provide them with the knowledge and skills to be advocates for the arts," said Doug Israel, CAE Director of Research &amp; Policy and program facilitator. "Our goal is to empower participants to be spokespersons for the arts at each of their schools," he said. This year CAE will be working with "Parent Fellows" at several of the schools to coordinate events and opportunities for parents to learn more about the value of arts education and steps they can take at home and at school to support their child's education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="975">The program was developed, in part, in response to research that demonstrated the positive impact of parental involvement on a child's success in school, and the effectiveness of the arts as a means of cultivating that involvement. Parents learn the benefits of arts education, of being involved in their child's education and becoming more involved in supporting their child's educational success. "What else was wonderful was getting to know kids and parents outside of school and seeing the wealth of creativity, ingenuity and fun they had to offer. The Center for Arts Education Launches 2011 Parents As Arts Partners Program At Schools throughout New York City NEW YORK, NY (March 1, 2011) - Whether it's sculpture in Sunset Park, digital filmmaking in Douglaston or pottery in Pelham Gardens, the new Parents As Arts Partners programs, selected by The Center for Arts Education for the spring semester of the 2010-2011 school year, give parents at thirty-two New York City public schools in all five boroughs the opportunity to personally experience the power of arts learning in their child's educational success. A unique school-based family arts program, PAAP engages parents in hands-on, interactive arts activities with their children, including workshops with teaching artists and school arts teachers, as well as visits to cultural organizations. Every arts activity is different.</paragraph><paragraph parID="976">They'll be creating puppets at PS 4 in Brooklyn, teaching cultural heritage through the culinary arts at PS 314 in Manhattan and using a local wetland park as design inspiration at PS 57R in Staten Island. PAAP is successfully planting the seeds of school community involvement. Of the 32 schools selected this year, 26 are first-time participants. Six schools that demonstrated success in building parent engagement through and support for the arts last year will continue in this year's program, paired with the new schools to promote an exchange of knowledge, experience and information. Since the program's inception in 1998 CAE has invested in PAAP programs in 567 schools. Last year's participants were thrilled with the programs' success. "We arranged outings for parents and children to visit local cultural arts sites, including the Queens Museum of Art and the Noguchi Museum .</paragraph><paragraph parID="977">It opened up a new world for many of our parents and kids who had never visited a museum in Queens before," said Margaret Borger, MS 172Q Irwin Middle School Altman media specialist. The excursions were great fun for everybody as well as top notch educational experiences. " PS 172Q will continue its program this year. The Parents As Arts Partners program is made possible in part with generous support from the Staten Island Foundation , MetLife Foundation and the New Yankee Stadium Community Benefits Fund, and with public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, the Manhattan Delegation of the City Council, City Councilmember Jessica S.
