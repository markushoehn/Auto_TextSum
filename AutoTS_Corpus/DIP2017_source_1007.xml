You can buy or make some washcloth puppets for your kid Never let your child see the water go in or drain out of the tub for this can trigger his phobia of the shower Do not create a fixed bathing time for your kid.

At times, what happens that a sudden gush of water may enter the nostrils of the child thus creating problems in breathing. Such a suffocating experience makes the child dread bathing and does not allow water to be poured over his head. Very soon, the child becomes a victim of phobia of the shower and panics even at the mere sight of water. The child screams, yells, tries to run away from the bathroom and reacts violently whenever he is forced to take a bath.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">This is surely going to be a major positive turn. Arrange for some special activities like watching video, reading some book or playing. The child becomes impatient and tries to hurry up with his bathing and cleaning process to get involved in other activities. In most cases, phobia of the shower, which you normally experience in your childhood, remains untreated and it is relentlessly carried on to your days of adulthood. You know that you are afraid of water but cannot really explain why. You simply try to avoid that area full of bathtubs, showers, running water and taps. If this is the condition, then my friend you definitely need some help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">The only way to escape from the clutches of this phobia of the shower is to take the help of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) and try to create the reality in the mind that taking a bath is a process of staying clean and it is in no way life threatening. The word "Phobia" comes from the Greek &#966;&#972;&#946;&#959;&#962; "fear"), it is an irrational, persistent fear of certain situations, objects, activities, or persons. The main symptom of this disorder is the excessive, unreasonable desire to avoid the feared subject. Phobias can vary in their intensity - in their effect on peoples' lives; from being an inconvenience, to completely restricting, as in the case of Agoraphobia. A phobia is a persistent fear of a genuine or perceived danger normally stemming from childhood, the causes fall into three categories: By using a combination of hypnotherapy and NLP (Neuro- linguistic programming), it is possible to get rid of the phobia very quickly. If a parent is afraid of spiders then a child can learn that fear and it could develop into a phobia.</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">The NLP technique the Fast Phobia Cure, sometimes called the rewind technique, hypno-desensitisation, CBH or regression are used to help resolve phobias.

How to deal with the fear The best way to treat fear of rejection is through NLP Self Help techniques The method has been found out to be extremely effective in driving away the fear from the individual, thereby restoring happiness and health of the victim. The unique NLP Self Help techniques enables you to reconstruct your lost confidence and push away the fear of rejection far from your vicinity. This principle of getting additional experiences is what allows the "Face Your Fear" phobia treatments to work. Cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt), systematic desensitization, and all the exposure methods, rely on this approach. The trouble is most phobia sufferers are reluctant to use them for obvious reasons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">The good news is treating phobias is much easier when you know the real cause. It's also much more within your control than if the real cause was one of those external factors. Other common irrational fears that people are affected by include fear of flying (aviophobia), fear of heights (acrophobia), fear of spiders (arachnophobia), fear of driving (hodophobia), and fear of enclosed spaces (claustrophobia). General shyness, social phobias, and other types of anxiety phobias and panic disorders can all result in public speaking phobias. People who have social anxiety disorders or agoraphobia (a fear of crowded places) will almost always have a public speaking fear. Examples of phobias that children can be prone to include: Nyctophobia (fear of the dark), Teratophobia (fear of monsters), Arachnophobia (fear of spiders), Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes), Dentophobia (fear of dentists) and Aichmophobia (fear of needles). In fact, most young children go through phases of being afraid of these things, but they usually grow out of it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">The people who grow out of them have taken their focus off the cause of phobias, and at some point allowed themselves to get other experiences. A big test, a visit to the doctor, a project due at work&#65533;all can boost your heart rate, make your palms sweat and get your stomach churning. But for about 12 percent of people, such fears go well beyond a simple case of &#65533;nerves&#65533; to become phobias. The most common phobias include: Fear of animals and insects (snakes, rats, spiders) Psychiatrists used to think that phobias are traced to traumatic experiences&#65533;for example, you needed to be bitten by a dog to have a dog phobia,&#65533; Schwendeman says. But we&#65533;ve found that many phobic people have no experience with what they fear.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">Most show up suddenly in adolescence or adulthood and are more persistent than childhood phobias (like fear of the dark), which often disappear with time. Phobias don&#65533;t usually disappear by themselves, but not all require professional help. For example, if you shake at the thought of speaking publicly, you might come to love the spotlight after giving repeated presentations. You have to look at whether a fear interferes with your day-to-day functioning or pleasures in life,&#65533; Schwendeman says. But if gardening is something you enjoy and your fear keeps you from going out there, you need help. Simple phobias, such as a fear of going to the dentist, usually start during early childhood, often between the ages of four and eight. Simple phobias often disappear on their own as the child gets older and usually do not cause problems in adulthood.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">Social phobias often begin during puberty and agoraphobia in the late teens to early twenties. Treating simple phobias involves gradually becoming exposed to the animal, object, place or situation that causes fear. This process is known as desensitisation or self-exposure therapy (see Treatment and Self-help, above). So if you suffer from a phobia do find a well qualified hypnotherapist near you. I suggest you consider seeking out NLP practitioners who understand the Fast Phobia Cure technique, or Time Line Therapy, or some of the percussive techniques, as one of these may work for you as well. Simple phobias appear to have a common trigger, generally in childhood, and all we have to do is to relearn the experience in a way that is helpful to our brain, and not harmful to us. I've had a phobia of injections since the age of 4 and desperately need help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">The best way to live with a phobia, is to ignore it. It comes down to redirecting your unconscious mind . You are the only one with the influence to change your perceptions.

The good news is you will conquer your phobia of getting old without drugs . The disorder starts in the childhood and aggravates before you reach the age of 25. Moreover, based on several facts and information it is likeable for you to state that this particular phobia is caused due to several psychological and hormonal disorders. This is generally referred to as observational learning or social modeling. Treatment of this phobic condition Certain medications and cognitive behavioral therapy are used in treating cases of societal phobia, but there are some doubts regarding the success and effectiveness of these treatments.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">Role of NLP self-help techniques in treating conditions of social phobia Do you know how self-help NLP techniques work in treating cases of social fears and phobias? If you do, then you can easily get rid of the apprehension of facing social situations in life. With the help of these self-help techniques , you create reality where you attempt to relate positive thoughts and ideas to what you do or think in life. Why is Hypnoanalysis so successful in treating fears and phobias (as well as anxiety/depression etc.) Phobias are almost always formed in the childhood (though the symptoms may not appear for many years) and are caused by the sufferer bottling up some strong emotions, and those emotions being projected onto an object/situation. It doesn't take long to resolve a childhood hear of, say, Dr Who and the Daleks........... In therapy, we can find the originating cause (the unconscious conflict) of the Phobia and release it - and when the emotions are released, the phobia disappears. Can I do anything myself to help control the Phobia?</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">I know that is easier said than done, but the more you think about (say) your fear of being sick - the more fear and anxiety you create, the worse your phobia will become. Is it not a good idea to read books about my Phobia then? How come different therapies have different success rates in tackling Phobias? Some forms of therapy attempt to 'get around' the phobia, or make the sufferer feel better about 'living with it'. Analytical Hypnotherapy can find the cause of the problem, and when it does, the phobia disappears - because there is nothing driving it anymore. Nearly all the sufferers I have helped, have also had 'Social Phobia' (see below) (Sometimes called emetophobia, emetephobia, sick phobia, sickness phobia, vomiting phobia, fear of vomiting, fear of gagging, fear of swallowing, fear of choking, globus hystericus) In the short-term you will feel a little bit better (because you understand a little about yourself - and this gives you a sense of control) but in the long term, all you are doing is spending more and more time thinking about your phobia - and hence dragging up more emotion.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">Others try to understand intellectually what may be causing it. (bitten by a dog = fear of dogs) The only way to CURE a phobia (to get rid of it completely, so that it no longer effects the person) is to release the bottled up emotions that are causing it. when you are a fifty year old company executive! Hypnoanalysis usually takes 8 sessions (though it can take up to 12) at weekly intervals. Most Phobias are not directly related to the cause of the emotion, they are symbolic of it. Most other types of therapy cannot gain access to these 'locked away' emotions &amp;amp; experiences, whereas hypnoanalysis can - sometimes quite easily. The above Phobias are almost always indirect - this means that they are usually indirectly linked to an unresolved emotional conflict.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">I've grouped the phobias above together, because they usually symbolise a situation where the sufferer feels 'out of control'. This Phobia seems to effect more women than men, and tends to have a very disabling effect on the sufferer; quite often the person has to avoid all places where there is a possibility of themselves (or others) being sick; pubs, restaurants, clubbing, eating in front of others etc. A lot of sufferers tend to view being sick as 'horrible, dirty, yukky' etc, and so it is quite common for emetophobics to also have fears of other situations where they might feel the same way; going to the toilet (number twos), or the inability to urinate in front of others (shy bladder), or even just being a little bit sweaty. Sometimes people with coprophobia/coporophobia use laxatives to avoid the feeling of going to the loo, and sometimes they might even 'auto-disempact' - which I hope is self explanitory! SOCIAL PHOBIA is probably the most common phobia there is; a pervasive fear of any situation where the sufferer is likely to feel 'on the spot', embarassed, humiliated or judged - for example; dinner parties, public speaking, interviews, appearing in court, singing, stuttering etc Associated symptoms: sensitivity to criticism, neagtive self image, fear of rejection, difficulty in being assertive and feelings of inferiority . Social phobia generally starts in the mid -teens (although it often follows on from just being 'shy') or can be triggered off by a particularly embarassing event. As with all phobias, stress (or the lack of it) will have a significant effect on the 'strength' of the anxiety created.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">In the D.S.M.4 (the Mental Health 'Bible') the main criteria for social phobia is listed as; A marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Men with shy bladder (and it is usually only men who get shy bladder - for obvious reasons) have a great difficulty peeing in front of other people, or in a place that they are unfamiliar with. As with all phobias, the severity of the symptoms can change from person to person, and also fluctuate depending on the persons stress level. Due to the embarassing nature of the symptom, it is rare that a man would consult his G.P. with the problem - and because of this, there is very little written on the subject. The main difference is in the severity of the emotional reaction: a strong dislike of flying is a fear, whereas a pathological fear (an intense, uncontrollable, unendurable, physical fear) is considered to be a phobia. Phobias - Symbolic Although some Phobias seem to serve an obvious purpose (fear of fire, drowning etc.) some appear to make no sense at all! The process of Hypnoanalysis (sometimes referred to as analytical hypnotherapy) requires a strong bond of trust and rapport being created between the therapist, and the client.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">Over a period of about eight sessions, at weekly intervals, we slowly link thoughts and memories back through time (by talking about them) until we come to the bottled up emotions. When we get to these emotions, we talk them through until they are resolved. The sessions cost &#163;65 each. A Phobia is: "an external symbolic interpretation of an internal anxiety." What does that mean? When a person finds themselves in a situation that creates intense emotions, the persons 'psyche' has the ability to repress/hide/disavow those emotions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">Once those emotions have been bottled up, the psyche will create a phobia - to warn the person not to get into that (or any similar) situation again. The fear stops you going anywhere near dogs, and hence prevents you from getting bitten again.

Another factor of phobias is that they can grow just like snowballs, each time the phobic reaction occurs it strengthens the fear. The first experience of a fear is linked to the second and subsequent events of the same kind. Thus the phobia can grow and grow becoming more powerful with age. Phobias are emotional events and our brain is set up to react to fears before logic can assists us.</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">To remove or reduce a phobia what needs to be done is to break the links between each emotional memory or override the structure with a new one. Most people with phobias want them cured. Phobias can cause embarrassment, a sense of shame, fear of it happening again and at times a sense of disbelief. People are often mystified and puzzled by their reactions because in all other situations they are rational beings. There is at times a fear of mental illness. There is no shame about phobias and there is no mental illness. Phobias are simply a part of your mind developing a habit that can be limiting in some situations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">This habit is triggered and the mind runs the habit. Our minds are set up to run habits for without habitual behaviour our lives would be impossible.

It is a very safe practice and can be a very pleasant experience.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">In my experience this method works well for some people. One of the most common reasons for people to seek hypnotherapy services is for help in overcoming a phobia. The most common phobias are those such as fear of spiders and fear of flying, which like most phobias are easily cured using hypnotherapy combined with NLP techniques that we have developed to make the cure fast and effective. We show you how you will easily be able to change the feeling of panic and fear to being calm, confident and in control. Often phobia's if not treated quickly will grow in intensity and take more and more things into account. Hypnotherapists often have different approaches to the treatment of phobias and it is important to speak to the therapist you have chosen to check that you are comfortable with them, their approach, and experience. We believe that therapy should be quick and painless, and not drawn out over session after session.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">In between you arriving and you leaving we will have some fun in getting rid of it, so that you can once and for all take control of your life.

No drug has ever been developed specifically for phobia of getting undressed in front of someone , and none can ever cure the root cause of the problem, only suppress the symptoms. It is thus crucial for people whose fear of heights could be harmful to get treatment for their fear. In the past, treatments included repeatedly exposing a patient to heights so they would to "confront their fear." This method proves traumatic and unsuccessful for most people. Other, more functional options include medication and counseling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">Hypnotherapy is an ideal option because it is safe, effective, and non-invasive. Conventional hypnosis works through direct post-hypnotic suggestions. Skilled hypnotists now utilize more advanced Ericksonian hypnosis techniques to circumvent this problem. Ericksonian hypnosis, as developed by Milton Erickson, MD, is a greatly more effective form of hypnotherapy than traditional methods. It uses indirect suggestions rooted in conversation, metaphors, and stories to direct the unconscious mind into a different, phobia-free thought process. This is effective because it is far more difficult for the unconscious mind to resist suggestions set in a dialogue, than direct post-hypnotic suggestions that are apparent to the mind. A well-designed hypnotherapy program combines a multitude of techniques to ensure its effectiveness for every individual.</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">The combination of many Ericksonian hypnotherapy and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques is ideal for virtually everyone trying to rid him or herself of a phobia. The combined program begins with a relaxation therapy session. Once your mind is calm and clear, NLP techniques can be used to cure a phobia. Summary: Several types of therapy depend on conscious effort to treat a phobia, but this often does not work because phobias are rooted deep in the unconscious mind. By separating or disassociating the emotion of fear from the image, certain hypnotic and NLP techniques can permanently eliminate an anxiety disorder very rapidly. Hypnotherapy sessions can help a person rapidly and easily defeat a fear of heights. Hypnosis therapy is one of the safest kinds of phobia remedies ever designed, with no side effects.</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">For men and women trying to beat acrophobia or any other phobia, hypnotherapy provides a well-balanced form of stress-free phobia relief.

Behavioral therapy and cognitive therapy have produced excellent results for many people who have phobias.

I am now ready to take on my life, experience everything and become better than i could have ever dreamed 4 months ago before my consultation. After having a course of pure Hypno-analysis with my local hypnotherapist - therapists name - my fear of people has completely gone. I started my therapy in Dec 08 when I was at my wits end; every waking minute of my day was consumed with emetaphobia... Classic symptoms included not breathing through my mouth in public, hand washing all the time, not eating out, obsessing over my sons temperature and nappies, I started treatment and although I did not have the 'big bang' moment I did see an improvement in my condition after each session. After 4 or 5 sessions I was hesitant about continuing because of the emotions I exposed but towards the end (12-13 sessions) I looked forward to therapy and enjoyed the experience of travelling back in time. I avoided relationships with the opposite sex to the point where I convinced myself that I was homosexual. I saw my therapist at a very low point in my life almost a year after a relationship break up with the father of my children, which had been at my instigation.</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">My therapist helped me come to terms with everything that had gone on and made me feel valid as a person again with the right to say no to situations/people without feeling guilty and thinking I was a horrible person.

If your brain thinks something is dangerous it won't let you get the further experiences you need. As far as you brain is concerned it wants to keep you out of harm's way. And by focusing on the cause of your phobia all you do is keep reinforcing this original representation. This is why some people grow out of their childhood fears whilst other people seem to carry them with them all their lives. Focusing on what caused you to fall in will not help. The skills and knowledge that will allow you to get out have absolutely nothing to do with whatever lack of skills or knowledge caused you to fall in there in the first place.</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">Finding the skills and knowledge to get out is obviously far more useful than finding the reason why you fell in. In much the same way, the external phobia causes listed above will not help you with overcoming the fear. The causes and cures of phobias are completely different things. When something's not working as it should be, it's natural to ask what the circumstances were that led to this development. Phobias are no different. In fact, the more of an impact something has on your life the more urgent the need seems to be to find out information about it. This is perfectly understandable as the physical symptoms of phobias are extreme by definition.</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">The anxious feelings and panic attacks triggered by the specific feared stimulus can eventually become unbearable. They can begin to affect the general mood and even the mental health of the phobia sufferer. This can lead to depression or obsessive compulsive disorder in some cases, requiring professional medical or psychiatric help. As the unrelenting fear starts to eat it's way into your life the first question most phobia sufferers ask is, When researching the origin of phobias, the fist thing you'll discover is they usually develop between early childhood and adolescence. Phobias can develop later, but after the age of 40 it's rare. Fear of heights and the complex phobias like agoraphobia and social phobia are unusual because their formation is typically more gradual, and normally develops during adolescence.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">Phobias are defined as an unrelenting, irrational fear response triggered by exposure to a feared object or situation. The different kinds of phobias all have similar signs and symptoms involving an intense state of anxiety leading to the sufferer avoiding the feared situations. A quick flick around the internet will demonstrate the understandable obsession with finding out what causes phobias (or any distressing mental disorder for that matter). So what causes phobias? The cause of phobias is usually attributed to some external learning experience outside of the control of the phobia sufferer. The logic is easy to understand and goes something like this. Before "X" Happened I Was Fine... After "X" Happened I Had A Phobia... Therefore "X" Must Have Caused The Phobia.</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">The Traumatic Event - The favourite of psychology and psychotherapy professionals everywhere. A bad experience at the dentist leading to a fear of dentists, being bitten leading to a fear of dogs, a bumpy flight with turbulence and suddenly flying isn't as fun anymore, an embarrassing 5 minutes in front of the class at school and the thought of public speaking leaves you shaking. In fact, all the common wisdom tells us any traumatic experience can lead to a phobia. This forms the basis of all the classical conditioning theories. However, our brains are a bit more complex than this. Very few of the phobics I've worked with actually got their phobia in this way. Third party Traumatic events.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">This is where someone observes someone else experiencing a traumatic event, and learns to be frightened from this "witness" position. It doesn't even have to be real. The number of people seeking treatment for fear of water more than doubled after the release of the film Jaws. But real events also lead to phobias. It is estimated that the national fear of flying that led to the reduction in air travel and tourism after the terrible events of 9/11 reduced the output of the US economy by 0.75%. 0.75% might not sound like much but it's the difference between a recovery and a recession. Cultural Causes (learning from others) - A few years ago there was a lot of debate about phobias being genetic.</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">But it was all founded on the discovery that phobias are more common in women than men and was blown out of all proportion. The reason that phobias crop up more in some families is because the individuals within that family have learnt to be frightened from other members. Observing the emotional reactions of others is strong evidence of a threat as far as your brain is concerned. All these experiences may well have been the cause of the fear or anxiety you experienced at the time but, contrary to psychoanalytic theory, they are not the real cause of your phobia developing. After all, not everyone develops a phobia as a result of these experiences. If we're going to find find the real cause we need to take a look at how your brain works. Why do people have phobias?</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">What you experience as reality, isn't actually reality at all. It's a representation of reality that your brain has created. When you experience something for the first time your brain does it's best to form the most accurate and useful representation it can with it's limited experience of whatever it is. With further experiences, your brain refines this representation to make it more accurate and more useful. But if your brain doesn't get any further experiences it can't change this initial representation. This is what really causes phobias. This is how you get stuck with the original fear representation - your phobia.</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">Here's what I mean. If you suddenly find yourself in a river, the reason you in there is not just that you fell in. The reason you're in there is also because you haven't managed to find a way out yet. But it isn't always effective. Social Phobia, Social Anxiety Our guest is psychologist Luann Linquist and our topic tonight is "Social Phobia, Social Anxiety". People who experience "Social Phobia, Social Anxiety" become very anxious when facing certain social situations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">David: What types of treatment for social phobia are available and which are most effective?

If we were to make a list of fears, it would look like this: dark, heights, crowds, loneliness, ghosts, dogs, cats, mice, technology, death, bees, thieves, elevators, earth quakes, water, diseases, needles... endless, isn't it? An irrational and obsessive fear turns into a phobia. Research supported by NIMH and by industry has shown that there are two effective forms of treatment available for social phobia: certain medications and a specific form of short-term psychotherapy called cognitive-behavioral therapy. Medications include antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as well as drugs known as high-potency benzodiazepenes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">Some people with a form of social phobia called performance phobia have been helped by beta-blockers, which are more commonly used to control high blood pressure. Cognitive-behavior therapy is also very useful in treating social phobia. The central component of this treatment is exposure therapy, which involves helping patients gradually become more comfortable with situations that frighten them. The exposure process often involves three stages. The first involves introducing people to the feared situation. The second level is to increase the risk for disapproval in that situation so people build confidence that they can handle rejection or criticism. The third stage involves teaching people techniques to cope with disapproval.</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">In this stage, people imagine their worst fear and are encouraged to develop constructive responses to their fear and perceived disapproval. Cognitive-behavior therapy for social phobia also includes anxiety management training-for example, teaching people techniques such as deep breathing to control their levels of anxiety. Another important aspect of treatment is called cognitive restructuring, which involves helping individuals identify their misjudgments and develop more realistic expectations of the likelihood of danger in social situations. Supportive therapy such as group therapy, or couples or family therapy to educate significant others about the disorder, is also helpful. Sometimes people with social phobia also benefit from social skills training. I am having to rebuild my self esteem and strength but my life is 10 times better now. Also the negative symptoms that have plagued my life in work, social, sexual and relationships have been irradicated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">I tried osteopathy and a night splint (from my dentist) but neither made any difference. My osteopath suggested hypnotherapy, recommending a therapist. I'm simply enjoying life more, now that I don't have this constant conversation with myself. The OCD has all but disappeared too. After suffering from occasional but severe insomnia for years, I now sleep like a baby, even when I have problems and anxiety in my life. My life has now turned around and I am extremely happy and able to give my opinion without worrying who I will upset and I don't feel I have to go along with situations just for the sake of it cos I don't want to upset anyone. It helped me remember the cause of the inner-dislike, and it showed me how that feeling had affected my perception and feelings about events during my childhood since the original cause.</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">The past is no longer defining who I am; I'm enjoying the present; and looking forward to my future! I will be forever grateful to hypnotherapy and - therapists name. I'm excited at what life has to offer which is amazing considering I've spent so long waiting for my life to get better. It has helped me come to an understanding about things that have happened in the past and helped me now move forward in a positive way, which I wasnt able to previously. I am 90% cured, although I don't think anyone is totally unphased by vomit so I see myself as 'normal' now. I enjoy life; I am closer to my son and worry only when I need to now. I can say that I do not like vomit but I am not overcome with the shakes, sweat and panic attacks when confronted with it or what could potentially be vomit.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">I feel like I can finally enjoy life and look after my son how I should....since my therapy I have fallen pregnant and suffered with awful nausea, I have not had ONE panic attack as a result and I firmly believe this is because of my therapy. I could continue but I think you get the point, one last point, my therapist was wonderful.... if you want to contact me to discuss my experience please feel free. It's amazing. I had suffered from emetophobia for 22 years, and It was completely ruining my life. I had tried many different types of therapy before, but none really helped. My course of pure hypnoanalysis only took six sessions, and it has completely CURED me of my fear of being sick. I am just a new person, and it is amazing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">The therapy helped me understand myself, give me more confidence in myself and allow me to feel normal again. I would recommend Pure Hypnoanalysis to anybody. I was a wreck when I first started my therapy and I honestly thought that was the person I was meant to be and would not have believed that in 12 weeks or so I would be the confident and strong woman that I am now. I no longer blame everything on things I thought were my fault. Now at 62 and single I am ready to live again. Thank you so much Banished negative thinking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">Restored and enhanced confidence and self esteem. Stopped me catastrophising things and blaming others. Freed me of childhood guilt. Helped me enjoy my fetish instead of thinking I was a freak. Made me feel generally more happy and calm. Felt like a huge weight had been lifted from my body. It's been 2 months since I stopped and it's taken me some time to get used to not having low self esteem and a feeling of worthlessness that I've had for over 40 years.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">That has taken some time but I am now feeling loads better. I'm beginning to realise I can achieve so much in life and have much more confidence in myself to grab chances when the come. I am now ready to take on whatever comes and to pursue the type of life I want for myself and not that which is dictated by what 'should' happen. It's hard to explain the change in me - it was a gradual process of self-discovery. I now feel able to cope with the stresses that life may bring me. Life feels calmer and I CAN COPE. The initial feelings of high anxiety have been releaved but mainly the guilt I felt but didn't know I was carrying has been completely released.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">I now understand a bit better certain thought patterns and behaviours so much better than I could have imagined. Social Phobia and Self Confidence - therapists name - has been absolutely wonderful and has given me a new lease of life. The self confident person that would happily recommend him to anyone General Anxiety Although I presented for therapy with known anxiety related problems, I have found since completing therapy that not alone have my original known problems eased considerably already but that other symptoms and behaviours that I had thought "normal for me" have also gone! This is an amazing therapy and the ONLY one that I know of that provides a real and lasting cure for emotional and nervous problems.</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">It seems so simple really but I honestly could not have done it without my therapist. I feel strongly that more people should be offered therapy as a treatment for emotional problems as opposed to drugs. I have tried both methods and would definitely recommend 12 weeks of therapy over 2 years on anti-depressants any day! I'm looking forward to the future! Social Phobia and Sleep Problems I'm just happy to be myself. I didn't realise how this was controlling every aspect of my life until it had gone.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">My self asteem as come back, I feel normal again,all the guilt as gone and I can actually talk about it without feeling guilty. I feel a new person and without - therapists name - help I would have taken my life. This treatment has made me want to live again. Depression, Anxiety, Panic and Claustrophobia I am no longer suffering from feelings of claustrophobia and no longer getting panic attacks. Social Phobia I can cope much better, with everything it seems.</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">I am aware of still going through some emotional changes but I feel that these can only be for the better in the long run judging by the changes so far. This is powerful stuff. I feel free of the anxiety that had hijacked my life. Now I feel 100% alive and I really like being free and empowered. I feel I am in control of my life and i like my life. Social Phobia, Sexual Issues and General Anxiety I have so much ambition but this one phobia is standing inthe way of me living my life.I am due to start councilling next month and maybe CBT, hopefully this will make things easier.</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">One thing I can suggest is to try to distract yourself from focusing on the anxiety. You can focus on your surrounding environment or listen to a relaxing sound or looking at a relaxing picture. We also have a list of self-help books for you to purchase on our Shop and many of them are written by professionals. Please also take a look on our Get Help session and remember you can always call us on our helpline and speak to one of our helpline volunteers. It is generally accepted that CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) is the recommended treatment for toilet phobia due to the fact that it is an evidence based therapy. However, many individuals cited clinical hypnotherapy, counselling, guided self help and other lifestyle changes as being helpful in providing benefit to managing the condition. Thanks to CBT things are much more manageable now.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">A combination of self hypnosis and target setting worked for me. I built up gradually starting with the 'least scary' scenarios, and with each achievement came more confidence. Use your self hypnosis to remind yourself of and to amplify your successes. Never think about the setbacks. I have just downloaded the panic programme from this website which gave me a whole new strategy for dealing with the panic attacks. I tried it today and it actually worked so I will keep on implementing this until hopefully I can finally rid myself of this problem of always needing to know where the toilets are. Being a 17 year old girl I just want to be able to go out with my friends and do 'normal things' but the first thing I think when someone asks me to do something is 'will there be a toilet?'</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">Poor toilets and restricted access: Children are often locked out at lunchtimes due to lack of staffing (no legal limit to playground supervision). My major fear is actually not making it to a toilet in time. My parents always used to excuse me from going to people's houses as I would run straight upstairs to inspect the toilet. They had to change a toilet and decorate a bathroom for me when we moved house as I wouldn't go in them (I was 5 years old at the time). I am seeing a counsellor to help with my problems and although this is a very embarrassing problem, I urge anyone to speak up about this. One practical thing that has happened at work is that I have been able to change sections and can now remove myself from the shop floor whenever I need to. This has helped enormously.</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">My counsellor has taught me techniques to challenge my anxiety which has entailed facing my situation in a positive way. My advice to anyone with this problem is to visit your GP. " I am now positive about trying CBT to help me cope, because at the moment it feels like I'm not really living my life, merely existing. " I have at times felt addicted to imodium, and underwent counselling to try and break away from the habit of carrying it. Reiki is helping a little, but only really with the panic attacks, which is what I tell people I have, not a fear of the toilet. When I was eleven I had a water infection and since that day I have been constantly stressed with the feeling of needing to urinate. I have tried hypnotherapy, but that hasn't worked for me.</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">"I won't go into detail because it would take too long, but coming across this website and in particular the TP articles, I feel like I have just discovered a hidden kingdom or 'never never land' - a place where I fit in. I have social phobia and OCD. I found out about the name for this problem from a classmate when we did a health project. The kids in my class couldn't believe there was such a thing and laughed. I am 17 years old and I have had a fear of toilets ever since the age of 4. I do not know exactly why I am afraid but all I know is, I do not like the sorroundings, the water/look of the toilet and the sound of it. At 13 I was taken to see a pscyotrist but it only helped me a tiny bit.</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">They said the only way to get over the fear is to confront it but how can I do so if im too terrified to do so? I am sorry to hear about the problems you have been experiencing - you could try a type of therapy called CBT or cognitive behavioural therapy. You can access this through Anxiety UK via the phone or webcam if you are unable to get it in your home country. There are treatments that can help so please get in touch. For more info please contact us on support@anxietyuk.org.uk i going round my m8s tomoz because my mum going out in the evening and i staying to sunday and i scared if i cant go wat will happen any help i went doctors today and he said try but it ok for the bloody doctor to say try but he dont have the problem :(:(: i h8 this social desorder thing i have such an intense fear of sharks (glabeophobia) to the point where i am afraid to go to the toilet the fear may vary in intensity, i have period where i will not think about sharks at all and then i don't mind swimming or using the bathroom -, but i also have periods where i am afraid of swimming in any type of water (yes even in pools) and where i am afraid of using the toilet because of sharks !!!</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">I will still be a mess, going in there the first couple of times, but I have to "trust" every single toilet. Is there a treatment or some kind of help for this? I hate travelling as a result of my toilet phobia. I have IBS and even though it's improved slightly since I made changes to my diet, I still get diarrhea at least once or twice a fortnight, and it's often brought on by stressful situations. Even when everything is working well, I usually have bowel movements at least 3 times a day, so I don't feel safe being a long way from toilets. The phobia stems from several occasions where my stomach has got upset during a car journey or whilst out and about and I've ended up openly crying in front of people because the pain of trying to resist the urge to defecate is so bad. I've received therapy for general and social anxiety, but I can't apply CBT techniques to this problem, because it is an entirely rational fear.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">Toilet phobia as defined here seems to be an umbrella term for a very diverse range of conditions that don't have much to do with each other and in some cases are almost complete opposites. I'm not scared of toilets in the slightest, only of the absence of them. I don't have shy bladder or shy bowel or fears about germs. It would be easier to find information if the different fears were given different names. I have seen several psychologists and been on various treatments. I am at a state where i am addicted to researching other ways to help me. The first was telling people.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">Then I started setting challenges for my self. I would put myself in 'unsafe' situations and just try and hold out for as long as possible and not keep escaping to the loo. I set myself targets over a 1 year period. I forced myself to do the things that I was afraid of doing. So my advice is to say please challenge yourself. You may have set backs but eventually you will get there. Try to identify these irrational thoguths and challenge some of these thoughts and replace them with more realistic one.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">Talking therapy would be the best way to manage your phobia. A therapist would be able to discuss some of the irrational thoughts with you and help you manage the anxiety. Dont be embarassed of the anxiety. Be strong and face the problem. I am on no medication and to the people who suffer with this, all i can say is its all in your head and you have to overcome it. Then I made the challenges harder until after 18 months I was doing things I would never have believed I could do like taking a bus or a plane journey without 4 immodium!! I believe therapy would benefit you alot.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">A dental phobia develops when you become sensitized to the dentist, in other words, when anxiety becomes conditioned or associated with that situation. Hypnotherapists use many techniques to help rid you of your phobia, often using NLP as well. They often start the session by using breathing and relaxation techniques, followed by working with the negative self talk, and changing it to positive calm thinking, However, this is again one of the traditional ways of treating phobias - the exposure therapy. The wonderful self-help norms of Neuro Linguistic Program will enable you to step out from the dark dungeon of negativity and try to embrace things from a positive perspective. In most cases, phobia has its root in the childhood, when the immature mind is in a vulnerable state to strongly receive anything peculiar and weird. When a dog bites a child, he remains afraid of the dog for the rest of his life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">What is most interesting is that a child in most cases forgets the reason of being afraid of a particular animal or situation. Suddenly at any point in his life when he comes across the same situation, he may be able to trace his fear down the memory lane. His exposure to the condition triggers the fear once again. This makes clear that how does phobia develop and how does it create absolute commotion at every stage of life. Remember, for treating a condition of intense fear it is essential for you to know how does phobia develop . Once you are convinced about how does phobia develop it is significant that you must attempt to rid yourself from specific conditions of fear with the help of effective self-help NLP skills and techniques. Once you start feeling optimistic in life then nothing else can hinder your psychological growth and prosperity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">We do not encourage the use of drugs and medication for Phobia of Wrinkles because we see them as a 'mask'. Fears and Phobias can be resolved with hypnosis and hypnotherapy For these types of issue, hypnosis, combined with suggestion therapy could enable you to reduce your fear or anxiety and to feel more in control. IAPH therapists have found that fears and phobias can be very effectively treated using pure hypnoanalysis and issues can usually be resolved within 8 sessions. Pure Hypnoanalysis (sometimes called 'hypnoanalysis' or 'analytical hypnotherapy') We believe that Pure Hypnoanalysis is the single most effective form of therapy available in the world today, for the resolution of anxiety, depression, phobias, fears, eating disorders and other psychological and emotional problems/symptoms. You can use our two minute Phobia Phobia Online Test to determine the problem's severity, but it's really pretty simple: If this fear is having a significant negative impact on your life, it's time to do something about it.

But it has persisted because your subconscious has linked a whole load of powerful negative emotions - mainly fear - to the very thought of phobias. Until now, you haven't had a methodology for reprogramming those connections. We're here to give you that methodology. Are you ready to put it to use? We don't actually "treat".</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Nor do we "cure". We simply walk you through the process that enables you to do so. Phobias Phobia Risk Factors &amp; Causes Those at greatest risk include: Does it trigger a dry mouth and clammy hands? Does your heart feel like it's going to pound right out of your chest? Drugs &amp; Medication</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">We do not encourage the use of drugs and medication for Phobias Phobia because we see them as a 'mask'. They may help you deal with your phobias phobia in the short term, but they do not actually help you overcome it. No drug has ever been developed specifically for phobias phobia , and none can ever cure the root cause of the problem, only suppress the symptoms. And with all the uncertainty surrounding potential side effects it is hard to justify popping a prescription as a healthy solution. Your email address will not be published.

Introduction Between July 2008 and July 2009 the IAPH conducted a type of survey (known as a cross sectional study) of clients who had completed a special course of hypnotherapy known as Pure Hypnoanalysis. It is ongoing as a number of follow ups are planned over a further 12 month period. Summary Clients who had completed a course of Pure Hypnoanalysis were invited to participate in an online survey indicating the degree to which their original presenting 'complaint' had been affected following the course of therapy. The terms hypnotherapy and hypnoanalysis are frequently used in medical literature, but have wildly differing interpretations, as such any previous research cannot be drawn upon as evidence for the effectiveness of Pure Hypnoanalysis as it is unlikely that hypnotherapists were using this specific technique. Its underlying premise being that we all have 'bottled up' thoughts and emotions, stemming from earlier periods of our lives and that these have a significant role in the development and maintenance of some physical and psychological problems. Practitioners do not however interpret or analyse client's recollections in the traditional sense, (such as frequently seen in the practice of psychoanalysis in films), but rather allow the opportunity for material to surface using a modified version of free association (FA) whilst the client is in a pleasant relaxed hypnotic state, (some times referred to as a 'focussed state of mind').</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">Pure Hypnoanalysis is totally different to 'normal' hypnoanalysis (and other forms of therapy) in that it genuinely seems to resolve the underlying cause of a persons 'neurotic conflicts'. How did we conduct the survey? On completion of therapy clients were given a card offering them the opportunity to log on to the IAPH website if they wished to participate. For this study no provision was made to follow up those who decided not to complete the course of therapy. What did we find out? The majority of respondents were female. The largest age group category for both groups being 26-35 yrs followed by 36-45 yrs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">The majority of clients presented with problems under the heading of 'general anxiety' although several also indicated other presenting difficulties, the second highest category being 'social phobia' and 'Depression'. This ranged from 'No interruption to everyday thinking, feeling and behaviour'' to 'Very significant interruption to everyday thinking, feeling and behaviour' on a five point scale. Approximately 50% stated that what they experienced in therapy was a complete surprise, (usually meaning that what the participant had thought was the cause of their problem turned out to be incorrect) with the remainder having 'some idea' (albeit vaguely) of the contributing cause. In conclusion This cross sectional survey indicates very positive results for clients who have undertaken a course of Pure Hypnoanalysis. What have we learned? I have been to numerous therapists, on lots of different drugs, been under psychiatrists and psychologists, and even been admitted to hospital - none of it really helped that much. I can not believe how simple the whole process is but how extremely difficult it is to allow the repression out.</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">I cannot believe that one repressed memory could have caused so much devastation in my life. I have been living within a glass box my whole life and I now feel like the doors and windows have been opened, I am now free so watch out world cos Im not scared anymore!!! Practitioners experiences to date have strongly suggested that using this method, clients can reach a point of insight at between six to ten sessions, and that having done so, this leads to a reduction or disappearance of the presenting problem, e.g. emetophobia. Evidence from clients suggests that the majority of these 'bottled up' experiences are linked with strong feelings irrespective of any underlying 'incident'. The words 'enlightened' and 'librated' have been in common use for some years. My therapy has helped me realise that I am not as bad as I had forgotten I thought I was. I now, feel like a weight has been lifted off my chest and have been left with a chance to make a fresh start without the inner-dislike of myself.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">I have been much happier since my therapy and feel like I can achieve more than I have up until now. I had very bad social phobia since childhood. The fear I had when in any social situation was uncontrollable. I would try to avoid people as much as possible which effected all aspects of my life. Anxiety, Bulimia and Childhood Abuse I would recommend it to every one as it helps you wake up to things you know about but would never speak to close friends and family Jealousy &amp; Insecurity</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">I came to -therapists name - at the point when my jealousy and insecurities had reached breaking point. I felt very unhappy and angry all the time and could not see it geting better. Only seven sessions of free association with - therapists name - and I am extremely pleased to say that I feel on top of the world. Through free association hypnosis, - therapists name - has helped me bring out the emotions that I had bottled up while I was a child and get rid of all the guilt, anger and hatred that I had within myself which was seriously affecting my daily life as an adult. In my opinion, going for free association hypnosis was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I would highly recommend - therapists name -, as she is extremely friendly, kind, non-judgemental and most importantly she knows what she is doing. Childhood Abuse</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">I was very nervous about the thought of Hypnosis and didn't think it would work for me as I've had this black cloud hanging over me, my whole life. (well since I could remember), and thought I would take this to the grave....but i'm the other side now as my therapy finished nearly 2 months ago now, and I'm still in shock as to what's happened and I still can't believe the new me....I really can't put into words how this has changed my life. I am now such a confident adult, who's wearing a constant smile, and don't think of all the bad stuff that was in my childhood. I'm 38 and can't believe I've got so much to look forward to. He will never know how much he has done for me. I will never doubt until I've tried something now. Therapy has made me look at things in a different way and has freed me to live again.</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">Never thought something like hypno could work but at the time would have tired anything! it all makes more sence now ...So glad I took the chance. Therapy was difficult for me as I find it very hard to open up, but I do feel better for doing it. I was aware of my underlying problem, but I was not aware of how it had affected me and how it was the root cause of the compulsive symptoms I was displaying (comfort eating, nail biting, depression etc). Therapy has helped me to piece together the jigsaw of my childhood years - and, most importantly, helped me release the feelings of guilt and shame that I'd been carrying with me for so long. Life has changed Although I feel the same in myself, I am free of fear and worry of what others think of me. Depression, Anxiety and Sleep Problems</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">At the age of nealy 60years it has taken me 49years to get help for child abuse. I feel calmer, more in control and less panicky. Normally this would have made me want the ground to open up and swallow me but I remained calm and collected and actually enjoyed myself, which is exactly how a bride's big day should be! Symptoms Of The Needle Phobia There are varied symptoms of this phobia, of which the foremost is anxiety. Applying EMLA anesthetic cream, for example, can be very effective. Nitrous Oxide combined with other oral anti-anxiety agent can be very helpful, too. How To Eliminate Needle Phobia With Self Help Techniques Self-help NLP teaches you how to get rid of your phobia.</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">NLP attacks the problem at the source and takes care of it for good . Cure Your Phobia In Just 10 Minutes A Day, Guaranteed! Needle Phobia Fast Treatment Guide Some people are more sensitive to pain during injection and hence ward off needles whereas in case of children fear of needles can result from union of factors like the clinical environment coupled with the pain of injection. Others include dryness of mouth, palpitation, sweating, trembling, nausea, over-breathing, feeling dizzy and lightheaded (or vertigo), drop in blood pressure, a feeling of sickness and fainting. There are several types of needle phobia, too. Most of the young children are afraid of needle, which they either outgrow as an adult or grow up into a needle avoider.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">However, most of the time this experience implies the first phobic reaction felt during a regular needle procedure. Treatments Of The Condition Firstly, it is essential for you to be honest about your phobia with the doctors and nurses who are treating you. They will discuss the problem with you and suggest solutions. They may successfully find an alternative treatment method. Successful treatment for social phobia, the fear of being put on the spot, shyness, blushing, and feeling embarrassed in Poole, Bournemouth, Wimborne and Dorset using hypnosis and hypnotherapy. With the use of hypnosis and hypno-analysis the root cause of the anxiety can be located and so the negative emotions that surround the problem can be released thus dissolving the problem for good. Help for social phobia using hypnotherapy and hypnosis is available in Bournemouth, Poole and the surrounding areas of Dorset.</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">This is best described as a feeling of being put on the spot, fear of being of being embarrassed, humiliated or judged. Symptoms may also include a feeling of being out of breath, almost like a panic attack , excessive perspiring and a feeling of anxiety . Situations such as social events like dinner parties, going out to meet other people or just going to the shops can prove to be a real nightmare for the social phobic. Their symptoms often include panic attacks , fear of being rejected, a feeling of not being good enough and being concerned how people see you. Analytical therapy (hypno-analysis) or a changing limiting beliefs course called The Thrive Programme, is an extremely effective way in helping a person to change their life. And if they talk about examining the past or your childhood hang up and look elsewhere - following this route is unnecessary for you although it can be very profitable indeed for the therapist. In modern times, this approach often proves ineffective.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">Today, people are very independent minded and will resist post-hypnotic suggestions by unconsciously refusing their orders. All phobias stem from the same thought process, so all it takes is a single hypnotherapy program with the right design to vanquish any phobia, or even more than one phobia. The techniques found in Ericksonian hypnosis and NLP are especially effective at curing phobias because they operate at the unconscious level of the mind. Although emetophobics usually cope by avoiding the source of their fear, it can be eliminated using techniques like Ericksonian hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming. Hypnosis therapy is a perfect tool for curing phobias because it can dissociate the sensation of fear from negative imagery in the unconscious mind. It is a proven form of safe and non-invasive therapy that provides a permanent phobia cure. Hypnotic treatments often take the form of a program broken down into many, easy-to-understand sessions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">A thorough program starts with relaxation therapy. This has a calming effect and helps make the mind more receptive to hypnotherapy. Once a person is relaxed and anxiety-free, hypnosis directs the unconscious mind into a new, phobia-free thinking process. Ericksonian hypnosis is ideal for independent minded thinkers, such as the many emetophobia sufferers who always try to control over their own health and well-being. It uses indirect suggestions embedded in stories, metaphors, and dialogues. It offers an alternative to conventional hypnosis techniques, which use direct post-hypnotic suggestions to treat individual phobias. These traditional techniques may fail because people have a tendency to question and resist direct suggestions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">These issues can be circumvented using Ericksonian hypnosis. Because emetophobia frequently occurs other anxiety disorders such as germophobia and agoraphobia, it is important for a good treatment program to work for all these issues. Ericksonian hypnosis and Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques work more effectively than conventional hypnosis programs because they are not phobia specific; they can be used to cure any phobia, or even multiple phobias. Moreover, the combined program will work for most users because it contains a wide range of techniques to suit any person. The techniques found in Ericksonian hypnosis and NLP are successful treatments for many fears and anxiety disorders. IAPH therapists have substantial experience of helping people to reduce fears and phobias over specific events and you would need just one session a week or two before the event in question. Ongoing and Pervasive Issues with Fears and Phobias</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">There are probably very few of us that do not have any fears or phobias, even if it's as simple as being a little fearful of spiders, or perhaps liking to sleep with a little light shining somewhere nearby as the dark is not comfortable. Many such fears are manageable and the majority of us experience them at some point in our lives with little impact.
