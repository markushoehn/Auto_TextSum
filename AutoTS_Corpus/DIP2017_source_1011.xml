    <paragraph parID="0">Berle raised four extremely gifted children, considered prodigies in their day, who entered college early. The Colfaxes sent three homeschooled sons to Harvard. Using one family with highly gifted children as a case study, this article explores the reasons why families of the gifted choose to homeschool, and how they do it. This article features an indepth look at four homeschooling families, including one family who are homeschooling profoundly gifted children. Wallace never acknowledges that her children are gifted, but those familiar with the field will immediately recognize Ishmael and Vita as highly gifted children. Using an unschooling approach, the children learn at home. Both children are also accomplished musicians.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">The book chronicles one year in the life of a homeschooling program for two profoundly gifted children. Berle's two books are the first real "homeschooling manuals" for the general public in this century. In the first book, he outlines a Christian philosophy of home education. One son became deputy Secretary of State under FDR. This article features interviews with two families homeschooling extremely gifted children. The article explores the families' reasons for making this choice, and how it is carried out day by day. This paper reports on interviews, conducted in 1998, with a number of young children who were asked about their perceptions of their home-based education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">Their voices indicate that they view homeschooling favourably. With the increasing evidence that the youth of today are finding school less relevant to their lives, policy-makers should be considering alternatives in order to cater to individual needs. Homeschooling can incorporate teaching strategies that have long been held to be educationally effective - vertical age grouping, one-on-one tuition, peer tutoring, supportive child-adult relationships, child-centred and initiated learning. Homeschooling or home-education can be defined as follows: parents make a conscious decision to provide an education for their child or children in place of that provided by schools, and where the parent or parents are the main teachers or facilitators in the program of education. In 1994 it was estimated that at least 10,000 people were involved in homeschooling in Australia (Hunter, 1994). Social opportunities outside the home of homeschooled children are often greater than for children attending school (Nicholls, 1997). Children who have been home-educated have successfully applied to and been allowed entrance into prestigious universities (Webb, 1989).</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">They found that at home the children engaged in much more dialogue with an adult than at school, and that the children asked many more questions at home. They found that the pace of academic learning at home was set by the children, who would also terminate the educational sessions when they became too demanding. Thomas (1996) found during a week "living in" with a home educating family who had two children aged 11 and 13, that incidental conversation covered a vast array of topics and there was a great deal of it going on. Viz., students develop at their own pace, learning is not compartmentalised but integrated, and the need for individual attention and assessment is addressed. Meighan (1995) reported that home-educated children who had previously attended school reported to him that they were able to be more efficient in their learning at home than when at school, in that it took them less time to get through their work. Another aspect which these children commented on was the relaxed atmosphere at home, which encouraged them to be self-managing about their learning. This left the children with many hours each day to pursue other interests of their own choosing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">It is possible children would derive a great deal of satisfaction from this sense of control and it would presumably impact on their perceptions of their home-education. Investigating children's perceptions of their home-education could therefore be considered worthwhile in developmental terms. Given that attendance at a school is the norm for urban-dwelling children in Australia, those children who do not attend a school are in the minority. The children were aged from 6-9 years and came from various suburbs around Adelaide. Of the final 6 children, 3 had attended school for a short time and 3 had never attended school. These comments encompassed how the children felt about home-education and what they liked about it. It has been suggested home-education threatens some of the implicit assumptions to which the educational system clings, such as "there is an important body of knowledge and skills that children should learn", "children will learn this knowledge best in schools", "children learn best in age-graded classrooms" and "teaching is a highly specialised and complex activity that can best be conducted by trained and licensed people" (Common &amp; MacMullen, 1986, p. 7; Meighan, 1984; Smith, 1979).</paragraph><paragraph parID="5">However, the research on the effectiveness of home-based education demonstrates that in terms of social skills, social maturity, academic achievement, confidence and communication skills, homeschooled children are superior to their school attending peers (Meighan, 1995; Webb, 1989). It has been suggested that home education is effective because parents engage in an activity called "dovetailing", where they respond to cues provided by their children to support the next stage of learning as the child decides to encounter it (Wells, 1986, cited in Meighan, 1995). One family from the USA educated their four sons outside the school system, and the three oldest successfully applied to attend Harvard University (Beaven, 1990). If this is the case for many home-educating families, there are opportunities here for children to make decisions how to spend their time and thus have some control in their lives. "I'm with my mum all the time" "Well I get to be with my mum all the time" "Well I get to see mum more"</paragraph><paragraph parID="6">"Like yesterday I finished my school, all my personal school at 7.30 in the morning" "You can just learn what you want" "Well, it's really fun and you get to do things you want to do and you get to learn how much you want to know and what you want to know" Three of the six children mentioned homeschooling being better than school, even though two of these children had never attended school themselves. One child, who had not attended school on a regular basis but had friends who did commented: "I probably say I would rather do homeschooling than go to school" The children were aware that they spent less time on actual schoolwork than children who attended school, as evidenced by this comment:</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">"You don't have to do as much work" Three of the children described friends and other child acquaintances as being jealous of children who homeschooled. One child reported that friends had told her "You're so lucky you don't go to school" and another reported a close friend as preferring him over another boy because he was homeschooling. When questioned about what they least liked about being home-educated three of the six children said there was nothing. "I just like everything about it, being educated at home" Two children (both from the same family) mentioned aspects to do with the academic curriculum - in particular maths, "I don't like maths in the book" and one child also mentioned not seeing friends as often as she might if she attended school. Two knew of another family that homeschooled in their local area, the others said their family was the only one homeschooling in the neighbourhood.</paragraph><paragraph parID="8">Another child knew a few of the children in the local neighbourhood, while another was not at all familiar with neighbours, or neighbours' children. One child said that many of the other people from her local area "hate us". Interviews with the parents and children, and observations revealed that the wide range of activities which the children were exposed to as part of the curriculum included, but was not limited to: maths, spelling, grammar, dictation, typing, shorthand, cooking, gardening, art lessons, basketball, Irish dancing, music lessons, ice skating and weekly visits to the zoo. There was a combination of self-initiated and mother-initiated activities observed, with the children themselves often initiating formal activities. Observations of the children engaged in homeschooling activities also revealed that the children were free to talk to each other, able to select items for use in activities, stop work to attend to an interruption (phone call, ice cream van, visitor), discuss ideas and so on. Sometimes the children worked alone, sometimes with siblings and at other times with their mother. They were also able to vary the time they spent on activities and were not locked into set time periods for any activity.</paragraph><paragraph parID="9">They spent as little as five minutes to over forty minutes on an activity. The observations further revealed the inter-related learning that was able to occur in the homeschooling situation. Discussion amongst family members while activities were undertaken was often observed. The atmosphere was a very informal one, with household happenings, chores and discussions occurring amidst the more school-type activities. The fact that none of the parents had been home-educated and some of the families decided to take up homeschooling as a result of witnessing friends homeschool implies that there is a continuing growth and interest in homeschooling in Australia. It also implies that the families were learning about home-education as they did it; they did not have previous experience to draw upon. The continuing growth in home-education should be of interest to state education authorities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="10">It is apparent from their comments that these children perceived the experience of being homeschooled as decidedly positive. While there were differences in how the families practiced homeschooling, all the children said they enjoyed being homeschooled. The children indicated that they had some autonomy in their daily lives and flexibility in the use of their time. Observations of the homeschooling practices of the families revealed that the children engaged in a good deal of discussion during the structured activities, with their siblings and mothers. These discussions could be interpreted as a type of "conversational learning" which Thomas (1994), and Tizard and Hughes (1984) suggest supports children's learning in an effective way. They did have the freedom to stop and start, discuss issues that came up as they worked and attend to distractions. The autonomy the children experience over the choice and timing of activities seemed to empower them and this is probably one of the factors that contributed to their positive perceptions of their homeschooling experience.</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">The fact that the children were motivated to initiate activities in the formal part of the day appears to point to this autonomy being practiced as a regular part of the children's lives. Three of the children mentioned spending time with their mother as the most liked aspect of home education for them. It is to be presumed therefore that a close relationship exists between these children and their mothers. The development of closer family ties is one of the aspirations of homeschooling parents that the literature speaks of (e.g. Beaven, 1990) and apparently, children also see this as a desirable situation. Child/parent relationship may therefore be a variable that helps to shape children's perceptions of home-education. While this did not appear to adversely affect her perception of homeschooling, it is not clear whether it made her more inclined to say she liked being homeschooled as a reaction. The acceptance or otherwise of homeschooling children locally may be another factor in forming the children's perceptions of homeschooling, but the relationship is not clear at this stage.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">If as Bronfenbrenner (1979) asserted, how the environment is perceived is an important dimension of development, then it is judicious to consider how homeschooling is viewed by education authorities and wider society as this will impact on children's development. If homeschooling were viewed as an acceptable, alternative form of education to school attendance, then children would be unlikely to be made to feel marginalised or outside the norm. If however, homeschooling were viewed as unacceptable by education authorities and society in general, the children of families who choose to pursue homeschooling may feel marginalised and alienated from society. This sense of alienation would have a profound impact on these children's development. One of the children in this study clearly felt marginalised and this is an area that is in need of further research. A larger sample size would give a better indication as to whether or not such marginalisation was common for homeschooled children. The results from this study make it possible to begin to formulate a model of factors which influence children's perceptions of their home-education experience and which could be tested through further research in this area.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">Of course any model must recognise the reciprocal relationship between the developing child and the environment. Figure 1: Model of factors affecting children's perceptions of homeschooling This model is a beginning explanation only; there is as yet insufficient information and research on children's perceptions for it to qualify as a definitive model. Not everyone learns best in the same mode or at the same time and in the same environment. There is a need to be flexible in curriculum and delivery and homeschooling could be a viable option for some people. We need to think outside the square. We could further allow for diversity of learning styles and situations by:</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">being willing to accept that school cannot meet all children's needs developing flexible arrangements for school enrolment (ie. part-time attendance) accepting and tolerating a diversity of learning environments if they meet learners' needs utilising new technologies for learning away from school setting recognising that parents who choose to homeschool are committed to their children's education pursuing genuine partnerships between home and school</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">recognising that teaching qualifications are not a prerequisite to assisting a child to learn allowing young people to pursue independent learning allowing young people to develop their own learning program recognising community-based learning and teaching as valuable and acceptable It could mean that homeschooling parents could be offered a position on school management boards with a view to incorporating the views of this group of parents into the ethos of the school in order to promote the most effective method of supporting the development of all children's educational lives within a given community. This study has provided initial evidence of the positive perceptions about their education of children who are homeschooled and as such has implications for educational authorities, educational legislation and even educational institutions.

Elye Alexander reflects on his six years of homeschooling from the vantage point of a Harvard senior. The school in the home. Homeschooling for excellence. Two of the six prodigies featured in this study were homeschooled.</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">Today, seven of Alexandra's nine homeschooled siblings also hold master's degrees. Stuart and Cynthia Sealfon of Brooklyn, New York, established a homeschool to allow their three children the freedom to devote as much time as they wanted to the subjects that interested them. Rebecca, the Sealfons' 13-year-old daughter, was especially interested in spelling and spent up to three hours a day studying word lists. Her dedication paid off when she became the first homeschooled child to win the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee. Tutors may be sought to teach particular skills, such as a foreign language or a musical instrument, and older children are sometimes recruited to teach younger siblings a particular academic discipline or task. Nancy Wallace, a homeschooling mother, said about her beginning days of teaching her children: "Every morning we practice our French, play the piano, and do some writing. Every evening we read aloud to Vita and Ishmael for about 1&#65533; hours.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">And in between? Ishmael takes two drama classes, a French class and a piano lesson for 1-hour periods once a week, we go to the library, explore the woods, observe nature and read." One unusual family, the Colfaxes of Boonville, California, have had three of their four homeschooled sons accepted by Harvard. Homeschooling families support a growing industry. For instance, Mary Pride, publisher of Practical Homeschooling magazine, distributes 100,000 copies of the publication. (28) Pat Farenga of Holt Associates, the homeschooling clearinghouse named after John Holt, receives 40,000 inquiries a year. (29) Amazon.com, the online bookseller, lists 217 books about homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">Frequently Asked Questions It will probably not come as a surprise to learn that homeschooling elicits much criticism and misunderstanding. Resolution B-63 stated that homeschooling programs "cannot provide the student with a comprehensive education experience." Further, the resolution noted that, if homeschooling is chosen, "instruction should be by persons who are licensed by the appropriate state education licensure agency." The choice of a household to create a homeschool, even in a nation that lauds innovation, raises many uncomfortable, but important, questions about family life, community mores, children's well-being, and government regulation of private choices. What follows are the 10 most frequently asked questions about home education and home educators, questions that reveal much about the American public's assumptions about conventional methods of education. Why Do Families Choose to Homeschool?</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">An analysis of 300 newspaper and magazine articles about homeschoolers revealed that the top four reasons to homeschool were dissatisfaction with the public schools, the desire to freely impart religious values, academic excellence, and the building of stronger family bonds. Ideologues are typically the religious conservatives whom homeschooling attracts. Van Galen notes that ideologues want "their children to learn fundamentalist religious doctrine and a conservative political and social perspective" and establish homeschools to communicate to their offspring "that the family is the most important institution in society." (35) They are parents who "come to their decision to home school with a broader interest in learning--they have professional training in education, they have close friends or relatives who are educators, they have read about education or child development, or they are involved with organizations that speak to the issue of childrearing." Both types of families share a common characteristic: they have enormous confidence in their ability to do a competent job of educating their children with minimal institutional support. Are There Different Methods of Homeschooling?</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">Is Homeschooling Legal? The U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights do not mention education. In spite of the creation of a federal Department of Education, education is an issue of states' rights. (41) For example, states such as Idaho, Oklahoma, and Texas are considered user friendly to homeschoolers in that there is no requirement for parents to initiate contact with the state to begin to homeschool. On the other hand, states such as Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York are heavily regulated (curriculum approval by the state, home visits, submission of achievement test scores, and so on). The second book reviews curriculum materials. Wallace removes her son from school after a disastrous early experience.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">This September, as I dove into the stories with my children, we did laugh out loud almost daily, but we also reveled in rich stories of a strong family and its role in the larger community. When I began to homeschool my children, I knew that I wanted to spend time reading good books together. Homeschooling is hard. Taking a classical approach to homeschooling is especially challenging; nearly none of us experienced that type of education ourselves, and we are often learning right along with our children. Staying committed to homeschooling through high school using a classical approach can be downright intimidating; it looks so different than all the other methods and often stretches us in ways we never even imagined. When we hit rough spots in our homeschooling days, sometimes small adjustments can help our homeschooling efforts run more smoothly and keep us on the path of success in our homeschooling journey. Set up a routine that works for you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">One school year I did not have a routine that worked until February. It looked good on paper to have my children all working on math at the same time; in reality, they often all had questions at the same time, leaving me even more frustrated than they were. I kept changing things around, trying to make the most of our time, but nothing seemed to work until finally, one day, I hit just the right combination that kept our day going at a good pace and left me with energy at the end of the day. If you find yourself worn out or struggling through subjects day after day, try shifting things around until the day, or the week, falls into place. You do not need a rigid schedule, just a basic routine that works well for you and your family. My wife and I homeschool our children. My wife and I are trying to give our children an education we never received, that is, a classical education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">It is hard work to both homeschool and to do so in a manner that, though as old as the hills, is nonetheless new to us. Designate a shelf for each child and at least one for mom. I remembered reading The Great Brain , by John D. Fitzgerald, as a child. We were so delighted with The Great Brain , that we swiftly went on to read books two and three in the series- More Adventures with the Great Brain and Me and My Little Brain . We are also currently part of two local Classical Conversations communities, which we find a blessing and a great resource. Hang shower board on the wall to use as a whiteboard. Our toddler is laid down for a two-hour nap.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">The school age children disperse to various areas of the house apart from one another. The two eldest kids each use 30 minutes of our two-hour household "quiet time" to practice that week's piano lesson. They use their daily quiet time to finish math lessons and IEW assignments. Any left over time is used simply to quiet their minds and bodies through meditation on God's Word, pleasure reading, and practicing their drawing and painting skills. From 4:00p.m. until suppertime, our children play. My husband leads us in a small Bible study at the supper table. When supper chores are completed, and if his energy level is enough after a busy day of running our pest control business, he conducts a Koine Greek lesson with the three oldest children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">While our household schedule is quite organized, thanks to Teri Maxwell's counsel in "Managers of Their Homes" and "Managers of Their Chores," every academic period throughout our day is filled with the expected, real-life chaos of toddler training, character training moments for every member of the household, as well as spontaneous, exploratory, life conversations. At 9:45am, we drop off my girls (ages 4, 6) at an enrichment class led by a homeschool graduate. The boys (ages 8, 10) begin lessons at 10am. The boys read independently, and we all take turns reading to the girls. Most days the boys choose their own books, and some days they finish assigned reading from history or book club selections. It's 3:30pm and we are on the road again. For this journey, our selection is Bible verses set to music.</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">We arrive for a 4pm speech therapy appointment. In the waiting room, my oldest works on his Essentials assignments while I assist my other son with his Language workbook. Our youngest entertains the entire waiting room with her choreography to the "Tangled" music. Our "school" ends at 5pm when my precious daughter emerges from her appointment, stickers and new work in hand. We pile in the van looking forward to dinner and church. The rest of our week resembles a more "typical" schedule of work in our schoolroom. However, we all have our days of carschooling in which we celebrate our freedom, flexibility, family and faith.</paragraph><paragraph parID="28">At the breakfast table, we began to implement this simple plan. We started with the fruits of the Spirit in order to address some character issues which had been slipping. Each morning, I read the list of the fruits of the Spirit. The children repeated them to me so that we can all memorize them. Then, we chose to focus on one each day. We started the discussion by considering the opposite of each character trait so that we would not be tempted to continue those habits. Then, each child had to consider one way in which they could demonstrate these fruits in our home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">There have been many opportunities throughout the day to reinforce these lessons. I even caught the children upstairs saying, "that's not peaceful. We're supposed to be practicing peace today." Over the years, I have employed the principle "simple is best" in various aspects of school. When I taught our children to read, I made the flashcards for our alphabet and phonics blends. When we study spelling, I choose curriculum that teaches children the rules and a list of words which illustrate the rule. We copy the words everyday for a week, and I quiz them on the words.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">I mark any missed words, and we continue to practice those. My children make their own Latin flashcards. This is now easier than ever before because the paper supply companies carry various sizes already hole-punched and on a ring. When they are struggling with a Bible memory verse, they simply copy it daily until they achieve mastery. The same is true of math facts and Classical Conversations memory work. Leigh Bortins often talks of the "stick in the sand" approach, meaning that you can teach someone to read and write with only a stick and some sand. This summer, we plan to practice this approach in our house.</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">All we need are a few good books (no problem there), pencil, paper, and time. Every morning, we will start with our Scriptures and a few chapters of our read-aloud. We will probably keep listening to history stories on CD as well. Then, we will tackle the projects we have around the house (maybe we should start by de-cluttering the bookshelves). The children will swim and play outside and pursue their passions-tennis, dance, and art. We will go to plays, listen to music, and practice the piano. My goal is to carry over the principle of "simple is best" into our school year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">If Abraham Lincoln could practice writing with a piece of charcoal on the back of his shovel, surely we can make it work with fewer resources. So, this year I pledge to ignore the shelves of Bible curriculum and continue reading the Scriptures. I will look for other areas to overhaul as well so that we enjoy rich times of learning together, free from the burden of trying to just get through the book. None of these books are required to be read in the summer, but if you want to get a head start on the next year this is the perfect place to start. Two weeks ago, we held a high school graduation ceremony for our son and older daughter. We set up a display table with items from our son and daughter's more recent school days. My part in the ceremony was to introduce the two graduates prior to their short speeches, giving the audience a glimpse of the interests and talents my children had developed over the years.</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">I had to adjust my goals, but the year did not turn out to be an academic disaster; in fact, as my two high school seniors graduated I was able to announce at their ceremony that they were just two classes short of completing a full year of college. Here, she is seen clothed in fine linen (Proverbs 31:22), a must for everyday wear but also fit for the armies of heaven (Revelation 19:14) and the exclusive choice for the Bride of Christ on her wedding day (Revelation 19:8). When adorned in these rich, deep, purple hues of royalty, even those challenging subjects of Latin, logic, and rhetoric will be at your command. These garments declare, "I am clothed in strength and dignity. There are many reasons why families choose this route: there is no Waldorf school in the area, they can't afford it if there is one, there is a school but it is a long commute (often with a younger sibling spending three hours a day in the car seat), they have had an unhappy experience in the local Waldorf school, there is no grade in the local Waldorf school for one or more of their children, the parents enjoy their children and want to educate them together as a family. In Virginia a group called Hearthstone has organized homeschooling efforts and provides classes for children of all ages. Children who have trouble paying attention cannot tune out the activity going on around them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">Only a handful of teachers present their lessons with such dynamic energy that all the students in the class keep their minds riveted on their schoolwork. When families switch to homeschooling, this entire social problem is eliminated. The distractions caused by the presence of other children no longer pull attention away from schoolwork. By placing LD and ADHD youngsters in an environment where they cannot be influenced by the actions of other children, their tendency toward impulsive behavior can no longer get them classified as lazy students, stupid kids, troublemakers, outcasts, or nerds. For children with a learning disability or an Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder, that's one of the biggest advantages of homeschooling. By not forcing them to blend into the general mix, parents get control over who will have the opportunity to influence their children. During their formative years, children learn by emulating the behavior of those around them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">Those who wish to be sure that their youngsters are not exposed to role models who will lead them toward violence, drugs, foul language, sexual promiscuity, and other undesirable behaviors see homeschooling as an affordable option. Homeschooling allows parents to be selective about the company their children keep. Custom-designed programs Those who successfully homeschool LD and/or ADHD youngsters tend to design programs that are child-centered. If the student has special interests and talents, they get top priority. Most homeschooling families are absolutely adamant in their belief that all children must master reading, writing, spelling, and math. The time schedule might not coincide with the sequence set out by regular schools, but teaching parents rarely give up until the goal is achieved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">It's a matter of readiness and a personalized curriculum that fits the student's capabilities and the parent's teaching style. Some children just can't seem to learn to read when the basic literacy skills are introduced in first and second grade, then suddenly catch on somewhere in their early to mid-teens. He was well versed in the classics and world history, because he was homeschooled and his family read to him. Many students have trouble when forced through a fixed curriculum at a predetermined pace. For those whose intellectual growth does not progress in accordance with standard developmental patterns, homeschooling has the flexibility to let the student's readiness be the determining factor in deciding which skills and topics are introduced. Homeschooled youngsters with an Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder still have difficulty sitting still and paying attention. Through patience, determination, a thorough understanding of the child, and a commitment to providing everything necessary for successful learning, most homeschoolers figure out ways to keep ADHD students organized, on task, and energetically involved in academic activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">In the hands of the right parents, LD/ADHD students thrive in the quiet, noncompetitive environment outside the regular classroom. When asked if such a radical commitment was worth it, these parents usually beam with delight as they say, "We've got our child back." Faced with an area where a youngster's development is slow, many homeschoolers have the courage to wait for a window of opportunity where interest and desire motivate the child to leap into the subject with enthusiasm and optimism. It's the teacher's job to be alert to the subtle signals that indicate when a new stage of development has prepared a youngster for success in previously unexplored territory. Alice, a pert little ten-year-old, had not mastered even the most basic elements of mathematical computation. She'd gotten stuck somewhere in the first grade and never progressed. Every year, her mother introduced her to a new book and a new set of teaching techniques.</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">As a youngster, her mother had been slow in catching onto arithmetic. One rainy afternoon, she curled up in the porch swing and worked her way through all the problems. She had so much fun that she asked her mother if they had another book of "number games." What kind of qualifications must parents have in order to successfully teach their children at home? Other states require close supervision from the public school system or special training for the teaching parent. A few states only allow those with a college degree and a teacher's certificate to educate their offspring at home. Without enthusiasm and cooperation from every family member, educating children at home is not likely to be successful.</paragraph><paragraph parID="39">In most homeschooling families, the mother does the bulk of the day-to-day instruction, but fathers are often actively involved in the teaching of a subject or two. Most families that are providing school at home are quick to point out that homeschooling is a lifestyle-an undertaking that involves every member of the family every day of the year. The traits that make a parent suited to the task of homeschooling have more to do with temperament than background or education. Parents with a short fuse often have serious trouble homeschooling. Homeschooling parents need to make it their business to find out about learning styles, their own as well as those of all the children they'll be teaching. Homeschooling is not much of an improvement over the regular classroom if there is no attempt to customize the curriculum to fit each student's individual talents, interests, limitations, and needs. One such family is homeschooling two boys, ages thirteen and nine.</paragraph><paragraph parID="40">The youngsters get up and get their day started before their parents leave for work. They do their assignments independently of each other. The younger son relies on his brother for assistance when needed. The older boy uses E-mail when he needs help. When there are decisions to be made, the teenager is in charge. During breaks, the two shoot baskets or play computer games or tinker with their bikes or work on projects or do their chores. When the mother gets home, the boys get free time until dinner.</paragraph><paragraph parID="41">In the evening, each son gets one hour of private homeschooling instruction. Both parents participate in the process of checking work, teaching new concepts, and making assignments. Not every pair of brothers could handle so much responsibility, but for this family, it works beautifully. A Utah mother of six assumed full responsibility for teaching her LD children to read. With the first one, it took some experimentation before she found a method that worked. Once she established a routine combining effective techniques with the right materials, she believed she had "the answer." Much to her surprise, the closet full of expensive materials that had worked so beautifully for her eldest didn't do a thing for the next in line.</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">In order to get her number-two son reading, she had to go through a whole new process of exploring materials and trying out alternative methods. By the time the second child was learning successfully, number three was ready to start. Fully trained and experienced in two methods for teaching reading, the mom figured that introducing the third child to the printed page would be a breeze. Homeschooling LD/ADD Children: Great Idea or Big Mistake? Homeschooling is rapidly becoming recognized as a reasonable option for disgruntled parents who can't get their local schools to provide the special services their LD/ADHD children must have in order to succeed. Homeschooling LD and ADHD children is not as hard as helping them with their homework. Others imagine homeschooling to be an excuse to let children run wild with no discipline, no formal instruction, and no prospects for success in the future.</paragraph><paragraph parID="43">To the unfamiliar, educating children at home is thought of as second best-an option chosen by religious fanatics, antisocial bigots, and those who live so far from civilization that normal educational opportunities are unavailable. Through conferences, book fairs, catalogs, and support groups, homeschooling parents make it a point to determine which materials are best suited to their children. Through workshops, seminars, consultants, college courses, and a variety of homeschool support services, they receive the special training they need to master the instructional methods most appropriate for their children. One by one, each of the six LD children in the family entered the regular neighborhood school in the third grade, fully functional at grade level in all subject areas. Successful homeschoolers come in all flavors The United States and Great Britain have a long history of educating children at home. The one thing all homeschooling parents have in common is a total commitment to providing their children with an education of the highest quality. Many homeschoolers maintain a connection with the schools their children might otherwise attend.</paragraph><paragraph parID="44">LD specialists in private practice can do therapy with homeschooled youngsters or coach and instruct teaching mom. One of the beauties of teaching children at home is the flexibility that allows families to design their own schedule. With older children who have a job or talented youngsters who need the daylight hours to practice music or sports, academics can easily be postponed until late in the day. Children with a learning disability have all their assignments tailored to fit their abilities and needs. Thus, by making it possible for children to work at full capacity and at top speed, most homeschooled LD/ADHD students get all their work done in three to four hours a day. We're grown-up home-school kids--and we're doing just fine, thank you. (On an important related note: it is true that parents of a wide variety of philosophical/religious/worldview perspectives are using home-based education partly to keep their children away from some curriculum content and engaged in other curriculum.</paragraph><paragraph parID="45">[15] ) Furthermore, West does not provide any empirical evidence that homeschool children being shielded from certain parts of public school curriculum harms them or the communities in which they live. Homeschooling gives children a much greater chance of retaining their parents' values because of all the time they are spending with them. It "allows families to incorporate their personal religious beliefs and values into all areas of the curriculum" (Martin 3). B) Homeschooled parents have chosen to protect their children from negative socialization, but their children are "seldom, if ever, socially isolated. Homeschooling parents have greater freedom to choose what they will allow their children to become involved in and the ability to ensure that their children do not become too dependent on their peers. If there's any horsing around going on, they are likely to be in the middle of it. Sometimes, they are the ringleaders.</paragraph><paragraph parID="46">In most cases, the teaching parent keeps changing the curriculum until one is found that works. Homeschooling is not for everybody. But in the hands of the right kind of family, it can prevent many painful and destructive situations from developing and can bring healing to children who have been all but crushed by the system. Those who are unfamiliar with homeschooling picture a mother locked in the house all day with a brood of listless youngsters plugging along through an endless series of boring workbooks. They make it their business to get the training and guidance they need to provide a strong background in the basic skills, while also nurturing and developing special interests and talents in their youngsters. Not so. Neither of the approaches she had so carefully developed brought the desired results for the newest first-grader.</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">It was back to the catalogs. By the time LD child number four reached first-grade age, this family knew what to expect. As with the siblings who had gone before, a completely customized reading program had to be created just for this one little beginner. It was labor-intensive and quite expensive, but the results were outstanding. Highly trained, fully certified LD specialists rarely have a record that good! Sometimes, a group of homeschoolers bans together and hires a certified instructor to teach a whole class of students. Homeschooling is generally done any way the family finds appropriate.</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">There are no fixed rules. And for those who really want to be free from the restrictions imposed by schedules, there's nothing to say that homeschooling has to be done at home. One California mother takes her three students to the beach twice a week. She says their best discussions take place during the commute. Some families give up the den or the living room in order to make it into a classroom. Kitchen counters are great places for working on projects, and front porch swings are ideal spots for reading. Some homeschoolers believe in teaching through real life experiences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">That is because homeschooling, no matter what your approach is, rarely looks like school. I just read a storybook to my two daughters 3 and 5 on counting money sitting on the couch. Now my 5-year-old is reading to her sister. Yesterday the kids did outlines of their bodies on butcher paper out on the driveway and we drew and talked about internal organs while I cleaned out the car! When you are homeschooling everything you do turns into an educational opportunity. When the kids got tired of drawing their organs they helped me sort the contents of the car: books, garbage, recycling. How many old water bottles did we have in our car?</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">I am embarrassed t! o say we had to group them and count by fives. We do fractions at breakfast. The kids now ask to have their french toast cut into twentieths. We do workbook activities, particularly math and handwriting, but we do them at the kitchen table. I bought window chalk and we often practice math or spelling words on the sliding glass doors (everything is more fun when written on a door). Homeschooling groups abound and you need not worry about a lack of social opportunities for your child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">We live in Fremont and have found a wonderful group in the Tri-City area. The group has park days, field trips, social events for parents as well as children. We also joined a homeschool charter school which hosts activities, occasional classes, and provides curriculum help and materials. Most homeschoolers avail themselves of a variety of classes to round out the education. Art, music, science classes at regional parks or Lawrence Hall of Science. A few moms of K-aged children in our homeschool group have formed a coop. Every Friday we gather the kids at one house, two moms have the morning off and two moms run a day centered on a theme such as dinosaurs, or apples, space, whatever.</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">We read stories and do activities for 3 hours. As for what to do with younger children, somehow you find a way. We have a sand and water table that I put warm soapy water in for my 3-year-old to play with. Sometimes she likes to do workbooks or color or paint while I work with my older daughter. I try to alternate between them so that the little one gets attention, too. Many people worry that it will be too demanding and hard on the family. I believe that it actually removes a lot of stresses.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">School puts a lot of stress on families. Nightly homework, behavior issues, social concerns, negative behaviors the kids pick up at school, negative attitudes towards learning, trying to get an education that fits a kid who has learning disabilities, who is gifted, or both, or otherwise special. Also kids at school are very peer-oriented, while homeschooled kids are family-oriented. I suggest you check out a homeschool group (or several) in your area and see if you like what you see. Lindsay I looking to make contact with the homeschooling community(ies?) Can someone help me? Here are two listings of support groups: http://www.homefires.com/support/ and http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/weblinks/support.htm.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">For those homeschooling gifted kids and teens, there is San Francisco Bay Area Gifted Homeschoolers, http://sfbaghs.org. For the math interest, there is a Berkeley math circle, http://mathcircle.berkeley.edu/, and for the theater interest, Berkeley Rep, where he's enrolled, is a great place to be. There is a homeschooling support group for every city in the Bay Area. One is Alameda Oakland Homelearners, which meets every Thursday afternoon from 12 to 4 at parks alternating between Alameda and Oakland. We also organize occasional classes and field trips.

My kids are younger than yours (they are 6 and 8), so I don't know if I can answer your questions related to older kids and homeschooling. The Homeschooling Association of California has a very informative website. They have one section devoted to new homeschoolers: http://www.hsc.org/chaos/ There is no homeschooling law in California. The California Education Code states: ''[A]ll children between the ages of 6 and 18 must attend a public full-time day school unless otherwise exempted.'' ('48200 )</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">Homeschooling families in California comply with the compulsory attendance law in one of five ways: * They establish a private school in their home ('48222 exemption). * They enroll their children in a private school that offers an independent study course ('48222 exemption). * They hold, or employ a private tutor holding, a California teaching credential for the grades and subjects being taught ('48224 exemption). * They enroll their children in a public school that offers independent study (public school). * They enroll their children in a public charter school that offers independent study, distance learning, or a homeschool program (public school). For socialization, there are several groups in the Berkeley-Oakland-Richmond area to choose from.</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">Homegrown Kids tends to have younger kids (up to about 8 or 9). Alameda-Oakland Home Learners (AOHL) has both younger and older kids, and Family Village tends to have older kids. This is another great resource: http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/ I am a member of a homeschooling e-list, Home-Ed: http://www.twobar.com/mailman/listinfo/home-ed There are many e-lists devoted to homeschooling, some of which are associated with different homeschool organizations and some that are independent.

We're looking for homeschooling options including groups, classes, or even one or two other children for our 8th grade daughter. We're especially interested in group teaching and exchanges for math, science, language (Spanish). We can do English/Grammar/Literature and History. We are a group of families with homeschooled teens and we help each other set up social events, classes of interest and events, and we also share ideas and resources. I too, am very interested in homeschooling my 2 children parttime. I feel that 5 days of school 8:00 - 3:00 is just too long for these little ones to stay focused and productive.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">Then it's the hectic pace of after school programs, having a family dinner, homework and getting ready for bed. With one day in the middle of the week for homeschooling I feel that it will benefit my children tremendously. First, it will give them a chance to relax a bit in the middle ot the week (my 1st grader asks me every day,''Mommy, how many more days until I am off?'') It will give them a chance to catch up on studies from school that they don't quite understand (and are afraid to ask in front of their peers). And it will give them a chance to learn about things that they are interested in and not just what the school thinks that they should learn. The other day my 6 yr. old daughter asked me to teach her how to sew.</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">Well, that's something we could do on a homeschooling day. I am a homeschooling mom of two (7 years and 5 years). Many of us were homeschooling our children until Wildcat opened and it has been an ideal middle ground between homeschooling and school. My definition of homeschooling is not merely supplementation; it is a full-time, enriching, educational program involving the whole family. You are welcome to join our homeschool group, Homegrown Kids (www.homegrownkids.org). There are a lot of kids your child's age (both boys and girls) who participate in the group. Our group has parkdays every Monday at different parks throughout the East Bay.</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">We also have weekly co-op day at various members' homes, field trips, potlucks, and other fun activities. A good way to meet other kids and families is to participate in afternoon sports, art classes, music classes, etc. One way to maintain these friendships is through afterschool classes. My children often participate in the classes at the Lawrence Hall of Science (www.lawrencehallofscience.org) and enjoy them. The East Bay Waldorf School may have information for you on waldorf-inspired preschools (www.eastbaywaldorf.org) or playgroups. We too had a similar experience with both of our children (multi-ethnic- Af. American and Latino) at two different public schools and chose to withdraw them for similar reasons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">We transferred to the Mills College Children's School (pre-K-5 grade), where our children had attended pre-school and I have to say that it was definitely the right choice in both cases. It is really a gift to see our children thrive in a diverse community.It is also just a progressive, more student centered/project based environment, and the staff (leadership, teachers, and after school staff) are gifted educators. Susan Both of my children have gone K-8 with Hickman Charter School. Kim I homeschool my 3 kids, but we have plenty of friends who are homeschooling only children, very successfully I might add. My kids spend 1 day/week at Trackers outdoor nature clases. I would recommend you join some of the online HSing groups as you'll get a good sense of the breadth of ways families 'school.' I'm also wondering how it works out if you have children of different ages.</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">The option which offers the most academic freedom is filing a PSA private school affidavit. You file a short, simple form declaring your home school a private school. The only requirement is that you take attendance. I use a google calendar and once a year I mark my three pupils present every weekday for the preceding year. *lots* of families homeschool with children of different ages, visiting some of the groups listed above will likely really help wildcat community freeschool is a homeschool-friendly program with intimate, mixed age classes offered 3, 4 &amp; 5 days a week ~ many families carpool from oakland. Hi there, I'm thinking about homeschooling my elementary aged kids, who are currently 2nd grade and kindergarten.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">We're embarking on homeschooling with 4-year-old twins and it's always wonderful to hear about others who are considering this option. We're in Alameda and are gradually building a network of wonderful homeschooling families. After two years of a private school and one disasterous year in a Berkeley Public School, we just weren't sure what to do for our kids who were bored in the classroom. We went for homeschooling. What a glorious suprise to find that it is easy, joyful, rewarding, successful, fun, and the best education I could offer my kids. So we homeschooled. We discovered over the past year that homeschooling has brought us closer as a family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">My kids are 10 and 7 and have never been to regular school. Another private? It certainly was never in my plans as an older mother with a career to devote this kind of time and energy to my kids, who were in K and 3rd. There is homeschooling, and then there is homeschooling. Check out http://www.hickman.k12.ca.us/charter.html for our local public charter school, and http://californiahomeschool.net/default.htm and ! There are thousands homeschooling in the Bay Area, so the educational and social resources are enormous. Good for you for thinking outside the box.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">Sold on Homeschooling We are a homeschooling family. I have a 5 year old girl and 7 year old boy. We originally started homeschooling our son because of his temperament combined with and fluency in reading by age 5. (By fluency I mean, reading intermediate chapter books). We were really concerned that his reading fluency combined with his temperament would result in his disrupting the class, over discipline by the teacher, and resulting low self esteem. (OK, I probably was thinking too much about it, but whatever) A major part of kindergarten these days is all about teaching the kids how to read. As he already knew how to do that, we felt it would be a big!</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">waste of time for everyone concerned. There were other reasons, but that was a big one. And it was an easy one for non-homeschoolers to understand. Last year was our first year homeschooling and this year our 5 year old is staying home with us as well (instead of going to kindergarten). It is really hard to articulate how wonderful homeschooling has been for our family. It used to be that I could explain our reasons from a typically academic standpoint; now it's becoming more emotionally charged and hard to pin down. Now it's about honoring our family rhythym, having a more relaxed lifestyle.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">I feel lucky that I am a SAHM and we can spend time together as a family. We don't have to rush out the door every day at 8am; we don't do afterschool activites, then homework, then dinner, then fall into bed exhausted. We can sleep in if we want, stay up late if we want, etc. We do lots of activites, but since my kids don't spend 6 hours a day at school, thei! r days are less crazy. A homeschooler's dirty little secret is that we can go to parks without sharing it with a mob of kids. Museums, pools, parks, libraries, zoos, etc. are quiet and open.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">Being able to go midweek makes a much more relaxing outing compared to the weekend, for sure. Good websites to check out are: http://homegrownkids.org/ http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/index.htm http://www.hsc.org Every Monday my homeschool group, Homegrown Kids, meets at different parks in the East Bay. There are lots of 4-5 year olds for your child to play with. Come and check it out! Laurel Homeschooling is a viable and popular choice in the Bay Area.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">Almost anyone can homeschool and be successful at it. There are many different styles of homeschooling, and a lot of curriculum to choose from, since homeschooling has become so widespread, especially in this area. You will find a lot of support! Pros of homeschooling: - You can tailor the education to your child's needs - It takes less time to get through a day's lessons - Kids have more time to pursue other interests or just play - No rush in the morning, no homework at night - You set your own schedule, which includes the ability to travel mid-week and off-season - No lost time driving, volunteering, or fundraising - I enjoy the satisfaction that comes with helping my kids grow Cons of homeschooling: - You may not have as much personal time - Substantial loss of my income - Sometimes it's hard to get errands done with kids in tow They have friends who are homeschoolers and friends who go to regular school. They are very active in community groups, sports, music, and other activities. We take a lot of terrific field trips and classes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">You would be welcome at any of the support groups to meet some homeschoolers and ask them questions. Most have weekly park days. If you live in Oakland or Alameda, check out aohl.net. There are also groups in Berkeley, Lamorinda, Hayward, and everywhere else. You can also find books (even at the library) which can give you a basic overview. Feel free to contact me if you have more questions! I'd like to give some downside-input about homeschooling, as I saw only upside-input in the recent posts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">I'm a fellow mom, educator, &amp;amp; ex-social worker. While I can certainly see some advantages to homeschooling (protecting kids from bad influences, the options of many educational fieldtrips, more individual attention), and the testimonials given by homeschoolers here were interesting &amp;amp; cogent, there are some real drawbacks that should be considered. At the end I will suggest ways homeschoolers can solve the problems I raise. Children need to learn how to relate with many adults, not almost exclusively their mother. The mother relationship is so important, and so loaded, but it should never take the place of most relationships to adults. Parents are naturally not objective about their kids, and kids usual! ly behave worst (at least part of the time) for their primary caregivers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="73">A comment I once heard from a child-development lecturer really struck me as true: ''Your child is not the child you see, she's the child other people see when you are not there. You are there to allow her to fall apart, work feelings out, and let it all hang out.'' So what if you are never not there? And how can you judge how she is doing? Every parent comes from a limited background and education (no matter how brilliant), because she/he is only one person with one perspective. Exposure to many other adults - even a few not- so-great ones - broadens kids' understanding of personalities and cultures immeasurably, and teaches trust of the outside world, confidence in negotiating it, flexibility and resiliency. And the bonds between teachers and children are wonderful and special, and would be such a loss to miss.</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">Think of teachers you loved or emulated. Some fine teachers really saved my bacon, when my parents could not. The mother should help her child learn to go out into safe, nurturing places in the world, and let her go. When a parent holds on so tightly to her kids, is she doing it for them, or for her own needs? Does she have enough outside relationships of her own? (Does she just want an excuse not to have an outside job?) If the kids stay at home for so many years, won't it make it harder for them to separate when they need to?</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">Will Mom let them go when they need to go? I can't help thinking of the psychological concepts of enmeshment and the rubber-fence family. Fresh air, fresh people and ideas are good for families. Yes, the world is a scary place, but there ARE excellent schools, and superb teachers out there, who will only enhance your child's understanding of life and relationships and the world. The experience of being part of a group of children is wonderful for kids, so much fun and so instructive about people and life. Kids are naturally social beings, especially before they hit puberty. (As an aside, I could see where homeschooling AFTER puberty might really be beneficial to certain kids.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">It seems detrimental to restrict their interactions to just mom or siblings, or occasional play with other kids at the park. They may fear or avoid large group interaction in future if they never have a chance to learn what it's like. Their social skills may not develop, and they may be shy or easy to bully. So, some ideas on how to make sure homeschoolers avoid these problems - and I know many smart, community-building homeschoolers already do these type of things: develop a big network of fellow-homeschoolers, and coordinate large-group classes or playdates. Trade kids with a mom or two several days a week, so that they get experience of other moms. Team-teach with other moms &amp; kids. And really do these things a lot, not just one day a week or something.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">You might also want to check out the alternative of enrolling your kids in parent co-operative school settings, where you can work in the classroom and contribute in other ways. My son is in a school like this (Crestmont), and I get to be in the class one day a week, and see the amazing teachers in action, and watch him making relationships and growing. I'm good, but I could never teach him all this. And I have plenty of time to have a strong relationship and have a strong positive impact at home. Remember, school does not run year-round. I missed the original question posted about homeschooling, but I saw the most recent response. My son homeschooled for four years and has just returned to school for 8th grade.</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">We've had a very good experience, both with our homeschooling years, and with the transition back into school, but homeschooling is not for everyone. I would urge strongly that anyone making a decision about it speak directly to people who have done it. Otherwise, you are just weighing people's fantasies, both positive and negative. The most prevalent anxiety is that taking a child out of the institutional setting is damaging for social development. Another common one is that the mother-child relationship is inimical to development. Both these anxieties are misplaced. Weigh pros and cons based on real information.</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">Hello, I have three daughters, 7, 4, and 2. We tried two years of public school for our oldest, and all my fears came true. So, finally I have convinced my husband to give homeschooling a try. As a parent exploring learning options for my toddlers, I have read extensively about homeschooling and have been intrigued by unschooling. Think VERY carefully about homeschooling before taking it on, especailly since you have 3 children. My mom recently homeschooled 2 of her kids (my younger siblings) for a couple of years with the assistance of the Berkeley homeschooling group (a great group of teachers and parents). The kids totally resent it now.</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">They are upset that they were kept out of ''regular school''. Also it was not the best thing for my their relationship. It's a challenge to be mommy AND teacher. Also, it can be very difficult for some kids to go from homeschooling back into the normal school environment so make sure that it's really the best option for you, your family, and most importantly your daughter. It might save money but is it worth it? Also if your husband isn't a full supporter, it could make it even more stressful for you--that more of the responsibility will be on you. I just decided to homeschool my children, and I have found that many people who are against it tend to be people who don't know all the facts and/or don't have any personal experience with it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">My best advice to you is to seek support from a nearby homeschool-support group. You only have a few students and you know them well; no problem trying to learn everyone's name the first day of school! You can let them learn at their own pace, in ways that work best for them. You're not limited to the contents of one room; you have the whole world to explore. You can see that they are learning all the time, not just during "school hours." You don't have to worry about the principal, the school board, or whether taxpayers will approve the next bond issue. Parents find that family life is more relaxed and enjoyable and kids are much easier to get along with when they are not under the pressures of conventional school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">Homeschooling parents would rather plan their own days (and lives) and spend time with their children than contend with problems of conventional schools. But many parents enjoy spending time with their children so much that they count it as time for themselves as well as time with their kids when they are learning something exciting, reading aloud, doing a project, playing games, running errands, doing chores, getting exercise, and so on. Others have regular times when each person, including parents, works independently on a project. Some homeschooling parents work from home and find the kids learn a lot in the process and make important contributions. Do I Have What It Takes to Homeschool My Children? If you're like many beginning homeschoolers, you're wondering what homeschooling will be like and whether you really can manage it. Thousands of successful homeschooling parents could offer you encouragement and reassurance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">Here are a few of the things they might tell you. The good news is that you have an excellent opportunity to find or develop a curriculum that will work well for each of your children, allowing them to learn more material that is more appropriate for them and their goals than the one-size-fits-all curriculums offered by conventional schools. Homeschooling can be a bit of a mystery if you're new to the topic. You'll see how homeschooling gives you the opportunity to socialize your children as well as build long-lasting and productive relationships with peers and adults. We'll also explore homeschool support groups, which provide resources for teaching your children and can be a source of friends, emotional support, and lots of fun activities with like-minded families. Homeschooling can be a bit of mystery if you're new to the topic, so in this lesson, we'll start off with the history of homeschooling and its status today in all 50 states. You'll find that homeschooling is legal and growing all around you, and you'll see how to find the laws and regulations that govern homeschooling in your community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">Whether you choose to create all your own curriculum, join an alternative school, or something in between, there's a good choice for each of your children. People often ask homeschoolers when they'll send their kids back to school, implying that kids might "outgrow" homeschooling like a pair of sneakers. Many people worry about homeschool children lacking social experiences and skills, but seasoned homeschoolers are far too busy socializing and expanding their children's awareness to be concerned! In this lesson, we'll see how homeschooling gives you the opportunity to socialize your children as well as build long-lasting and productive relationships with peers and adults. You'll learn about the difference between classes and co-ops, and the great opportunities a homeschool conference provides for you and your children. I learned a lot of very useful information in the course, discussion area, and extra links at the end of lessons. With 5 kids, I wish I had more time to click on every link and delve into the material more!</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">A) It is common knowledge that children mature at different rates, yet too often the public school's context of a "good" child is one who "fits or is able to adapt to curricular stereotypes, learning what is given when it is given" (Colfax 41). B) If a child is not ready to learn when age-oriented teachers are ready to teach, no learning will take place (44). C) Parents homeschooling their children are able to speed up or slow down schoolwork, unconstrained with governmentally-approved curriculums or work having to be handed in at a certain time (Colfax 48). If two families decide to homeschool together, the authorities prefer that at least one adult from each family has this qualification; however, the law will be satisfied if only one adult, who assumes responsibility for both families, has this. Statistically, two-family home schools have not proven very stable. How do I find time to teach several children of different ages and ability levels? Two methods have been especially useful: (1) get the older children to help teach the younger ones, and (2) use the unit study approach.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">For the latter, everyone studies the same subject at the same time, using multiple media (books, magazines, videos, maps, field trips, etc.), but at different levels. Thus, for example, the younger children go along on the field trip, look at the pictures, and are read to, while the older ones read books and prepare reports and maps. Conflict between material learned at school and the religious or cultural values the family wishes to teach the children. Continuation of a nurturing, self-reliant way of life that parents truly believe is best for the children. A family's frequent travel, distance from good schools, or other lifestyle considerations. You can choose the level and pace appropriate for each child. Remember that parents can learn along with children the subjects they don't know.</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">Older children, especially, can become mostly self-taught. Colleges are becoming more accepting all the time, and those that have had homeschooled students have generally found them to be such a positive experience that they are now actively recruiting more. How will I know whether my children are keeping up with others in conventional schools? Families may want to group together for testing purposes for added validity. Can my children test with public or private school children? If a private school is using a nationally standardized test and is willing to include your children, this arrangement will work. Will the administrators of the public school my children are going to now give me a hard time if I take them out?</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">Can my children attend public or private school part time and do the rest at home? This Tips for Parents article is from a seminar hosted by Dr. Nadia Webb, who provides homeschooling moms advice by addressing some of the challenges homeschooling parents go through with their children. This article by Julian Stanley, Alexander Plotinck and Michele Cargain offers insights into radical acceleration. Two radically acclerated students (Plotnik and Cargain) provide insight on their educational experiences. Davidson Family Consultant compiled notes from a Q &amp; A session with Jon Reider of San Francisco University High School. Some examples of the discussed topics are "Do you have any advice for homeschooling students or parents?" There is little compelling evidence that children learn more in any one type of school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">I'll make some more conservative assumptions, estimating that there are 40,000 Texas homeschooling families with two children each that are of school age (not the same as compulsory schooling age, but of such age that they would be enrolled in public school if not homeschooled). A Fitting into a homeschool group is much like the dynamics between any human beings. You may know two completely opposite people who get along great. Or you may know of people with similar personalities and interests who don&#65533;t care for each other&#65533;s company. A   As parents of an only child, we can answer, "Yes, it can be done very successfully." We won&#65533;t say it is easy; in fact, we believe it&#65533;s harder to homeschool an only child. (Most of our homeschooling friends have two to eight children.)</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">Q  Homeschoolers seem to occupy the far left or religious right, whereas I am somewhere in the middle. Where or how do I fit into all of this? A   You are right on point. Possibly your perception of the political orientation of homeschoolers is left over from an earlier era. In the &#65533;70s (and even earlier), most homeschoolers were of a religious persuasion or were leftist radicals who wanted to "drop out" of society. Since the late &#65533;80s, however, homeschooling has become increasingly mainstream, attracting more and more professional or upper-income parents (along with lower- and middle-income families) opting to teach their own children at home&#65533;especially as they approach high school age. Q  If I have three children I want to homeschool, do I have to teach three levels of math, science, and English each day?</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">A   Probably not. One great thing about having two or more children in a homeschooling setting is that the younger ones want to keep up with the older ones. There is less total work when children are fairly close rather than far apart in age. Some families report that their children set up a natural, healthy competition among themselves. In the case of English, the younger child may have to catch up to be on a par with the older, but will do that on his or her own. Q  What about homeschooling an only child? A   If you are new to homeschooling and don&#65533;t know where to begin, then a prepackaged curriculum could be ideal for you and your homeschooled child or children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">For families with more than one child, choosing a homeschool program can be more problematic. What works for one child may not work for another. What works for one subject may not work on the next. What works one year, may fall flat the very next year. I am a homeschooling mother of three boys ages 4, 6 and 8. My kids have so much fun with the activities that they don't even notice that they're learning! Now I continue teaching and learning with my children, while also working part time outside the home as a relay operator for the deaf and hard of hearing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">I have homeschooled my children for six years now. So far I have taught kindergarten through seventh grade. Legal disclaimer: This section is two family's stories and how they meet the mandatory school attendance laws in Iowa. They allow homeschoolers access to their teacher workstation where you can laminate, make die cuts, buttons, bind books and more. I feel like I have a lot of freedom and support as a homeschooler in Iowa. The laws are not the most lenient in the country, but something I can work with. On the down side, I could really go for a bigger, more diverse homeschooling community.</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">In Iowa, all homeschoolers must submit a form reporting that their child will be receiving education outside of a public or accredited private school. In addition, all children ages 7-15 have to either meet with a licensed teacher four times each quarter, or the parent has to prove they are making adequate progress either through standardized testing, a report card from a correspondence school, or submitting a portfolio which will be reviewed by a licensed teacher. Portfolios for children through grade five have to include information about reading, language arts and math. Higher grades have to also include science and social studies. We fulfill the requirement by participating in a homeschool assistance program. Ours is at http://homeschool.cr.k12.ia.us . Through this assistance program our children go to school with other homeschoolers for four hours one day each week.</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">During their time there they go to art, music, gym, recess, lunch, the library, the computer lab and each month there is a special subject they learn about such as bees or spelunking. To complete the rest of the contacts, they stay after school for 30-45 minutes once each month and do a fun project, usually including a story and some sort of hands-on activity like painting or making ice cream. Time4Learning is vibrant, engaging, educational, and funny. Time4Learning is so effective that very little intervention is required. This works great if you're homeschooling multiple children. What Robyn's Homeschool Day Looks Like Each day all of my children have language arts and math lessons to do from various books.</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">With three younger children needing lots of one-on-one time, it often seems the hardest part of homeschooling is keeping everyone productive and occupied at once. If I had three children all lined up, each with a different book, asking me for help all at once, nobody would get anything done. Having some of their lessons on the computer helps. On very productive mornings, one child will start with lessons on Time4Learning.com, while another works one-on-one with me, and the other does Spanish or typing practice on the other computer or a puzzle. After that is completed, we read together and do unit study activities and maybe go to the library. On sleepier mornings, the kids will each do their Time4Learning lessons, which gives me a break, and seems less like school work to them than their book work. Then we'll relax and play until we start feeling motivated to get to our book work.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">On those days, usually one child is in the house doing their lessons while the other two are outside playing with the neighborhood children who are, by that time, home from school. On days that are just too busy for our normal routine, the kids can do a few lessons on Time4Learning pretty quickly, and then I know that school work for the day was not completely abandoned. Most of the homeschooling resources and support we have received has come from local sources. The homeschool support group I was involved with had a MNO (Mother's Night Out) once a month, a field trip (planned by a different mother each month) and on Fridays in the winter met at a local hotel to have a swimming afternoon. The HSAP I was involved with met twice a month for various activities planned by the teacher. Twice a year there were family picnics. In the last four years I have been involved in a homeschool support group for three years, but this last year I slowed down a bit and was not involved with anything outside of homeschooling since I was taking care of our newborn.</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">Join a HSAP and then the HSAP teacher will help keep you on track for meeting the requirements. Have a supervising teacher. Keep a portfolio and have a certified teacher evaluate it and turn a report into your school district. Take an acceptable standardized test, such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. Also, throw in stopping to feed the baby several times throughout the day. This year, a day in the Taylor homeschool was a fight to stay on routine. With a new baby in the house, it was a challenge, but we did it!</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">I would try to have the kids up and dressed by 8:00 a.m. (some mornings a few would stay in their PJs and I did not have the energy to fight them). Then each child would draw a stick from the breakfast job cup. After breakfast was eaten and cleaned up, we would attempt to start school by 9:00 a.m. There were days that I would be teaching the first subject while the kids were eating breakfast. We are doing unit studies now so I could teach all of them at one time for the first subject. Then I would have the oldest two children each get on the computer and one would do math on T4L while the other did language arts. I would then work with another child who is learning to read.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">Then two more kids would get on the computer to work on either language arts or math while I taught the other student reading. The oldest two would then work on vocabulary. They would switch computers and do the opposite of language arts or math on T4L -- whichever had not been done before by that student. Then I would teach the oldest four students history (unit study) while the kindergartner did math and language arts on T4L and the 4-year-old did a few minutes of T4L preschool and then play learning games on other Internet sites. Then I would teach the second, third, and fourth child science, while the oldest studied science independently. We would then take a break for lunch. I would then work on some preschool stuff or just play with the 4-year-old while my oldest taught the kindergartner reading activities that came from the T4L lesson plans and went along with the activities on the T4L site.</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">Then I would send everyone to their room from 1:00 p.m. until 2:00 p.m. Each child had to read or look at a book depending on ability. During this time I laid down for rest or a nap. Then after book/rest time, we would attempt to do a little housework and I would work on the laundry. The children were enrolled in Tae Kwan Do two afternoons a week to give them a physical education activity. Then it was home for supper. My great hubby would then help kids get ready and tucked into bed. The adults would fall into bed in hopes of catching a few hours of sleep between baby and other children waking up during the night.</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">Then start all over again if it was a weekday. If it was the weekend, we would try to sleep in as long as possible! I LOVE Time4Learning! It holds the attention of my kids, plus I can keep track of their learning without hovering over their shoulders. I am really pleased with Time4Learning. It has made a world of difference in my son's academic performance in school! Since 1999, very experienced homeschoolers have been sharing some of their wisdom in moving statements during the general session at WPA's annual conferences.</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">Rather than being limited to their homes, homeschoolers are active in their communities and learn through work experience, volunteer service, field trips, travel, and other activities outside their homes. Get a three ring binder &#151; one for each of your children. Mounting photographs of your children working, at field trips, during labs, etc. on special acid-free paper and placing same in a page protector in that child's portfolio is helpful. Contact your state congressman and ask for a FREE copy of your state's homeschooling law. You may also want to contact Home School Legal Defense Association 's web site for a quick review of the requirements for your state. For more research in this area, you may want to check out the following books by the late Dr. R.J. Rushdoony, the Father of Modern Homeschooling ... Intellectual Schizophrenia by Dr. R.J.Rushdoony, Ross House Books, Vallecito, CA, &#169; 1961</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">This book provides the philosophical groundwork for homeschooling and private Christian schooling and more. Sit down and make out a schedule that will fit the needs of your family. Remember it does not "have" to be mom that teaches. Older children can help younger children. The cost of homeschooling depends upon the decisions of the homeschooling family, ages and number of children, family lifestyle, educational philosophy, how many field trips and extracurricular activities, curriculum choice, etc. Many factors &#151; ages and number of children, family lifestyle, educational philosophy, field trips, extracurricular activities, curriculum choice, etc. &#151; will determine how long it takes to homeschool. Overall, for younger grades (kindergarten through 6th grade), takes only 1-2 hours per day if that long.</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">14) Can I homeschool someone else's children or my grandchildren? Depending on your State, yes you may homeschool someone else's children or your grandchildren. Many individuals at local churches all across the country have volunteered to homeschool children or assist others especially children of widows/widowers, military families, etc. It is the freedom to learn alongside of your children while bonding with them. Homeschooling Benefits Children less preoccupied with peer acceptance. She has published numerous articles for parents, is a contributor to The Homeschool Book of Answers by Linda Dobson and presents workshops on a variety of topics pertaining to families. She has been homeschooling since 1987 and is one of the founding mothers of the largest secular homeschool support group in the Los Angeles areas.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">She has also been an expert witness for homeschooling custody cases. Currently she is homeschooling her youngest child, teaches adults with disabilities, sees private clients and is a girl scout leader. What I most often hear from new homeschooling families who have had a chance to observe veteran homeschooled children is how impressed they are with the level of cooperative play and learning, the way older children look after and include younger children, and the ease with which children mix with varied age groups. insofar as self concept is a reflector of socialization, it would appear that few home-schooled children are socially deprived, and that there may be sufficient evidence to indicate that some home-schooled children have a higher self concept than conventionally schooled children (1992). For the most part, researchers and therapists look to see if the child interacts comfortably with family and close friends, has at least one friend by school age or early adolescence that is mutually satisfying, can abide by the general rules of the society in which they live, and is engaged in activities that match their temperament and interests. Webb, another researcher who looked at aspects of the adult lives of wholly or partly home-educated people, found that all who had attempted higher education were successful and that their socialization was often better than that of their schooled peers (1989). As a group they are not homogeneous or amenable to easy categorizations: they are located throughout the United States and Canada in both rural and urban areas: they are employed in a variety of professions and occupations, although many seem to be concentrated in those occupations that allow for independence, flexibility and often, creativity; and they exhibit a wide range of political views, and religious affiliations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">Studies have shown that children learn to socialize in a positive way by spending time with people who love them and have a compelling interest in helping them learn to be a part of society. They learn this art of being social by being with people of all ages and by following the models of the adults around them in a healthy way. They learn by being with friends, siblings, shopkeepers and neighbors, learning what does and what doesn't work. In a study conducted by Lee Stough (1992) comparison was made of 30 homeschooling families and 32 conventionally schooling families with children 7-14 years of age. According to the findings, children who were schooled at home "gained the necessary skills, knowledge, and attitudes needed to function in society at a rate similar to that of conventionally schooled children" (Stough, 1992). The researcher found no difference in the self-concept of children in the two groups. The ideological homeschoolers had a diversity of reasons for their dissatisfaction: 1) public schools did not provide either enough or the right kind of religious education; 2) parents of &#65533;gifted&#65533; or &#65533;bright&#65533; children felt that the regular school curriculum was not demanding enough to provide a challenge for their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">Both the ideologues and pedagogues did share some reasons for wanting to homeschool their children, such as: 1) creating a stronger family bond (family unity); 2) homeschooling provides a way to practice an alternative lifestyle (getting away from materialist and consumerist values); 3) many parents themselves had unpleasant memories of school when they were children; 4) homeschooling allows parents the right to be responsible for their childrens&#65533; education. For instance, Holt wrote in the second issue of GWS about how a welfare mother who doesn't know how to read can still teach her own kids by finding a child, relative, or friend who can teach them all to read. He cites various mass literacy programs used in a number of poor countries in which as fast as people learn to read they begin to teach others, as well as various schools whose policy of allowing older children to teach younger children to read has borne excellent results. Some families prefer to develop communal resources rather than buying them; they join together to form homeschooling co-ops and learning centers in people's homes or to share facilities, costs, and teachers for group instruction. A Hardships such as living on one income, learning how to be together day in and day out, and parents having to re-learn or learn certain academic subjects at first may seem like negatives, but if you give yourself the opportunity to discover that these negatives can be positives, homeschooling can lead to the greatest metamorphosis of your life! We are so happy and satisfied with our decision to homeschool that there has not been a downside that we consider worthy of mention. What at first seemed like adversity has grown into a new, freer, and much larger life than we dreamed of.</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">Since the late &#65533;80s, however, homeschooling has become increasingly mainstream, attracting more and more professional or upper-income parents (along with lower- and middle-income families) opting to teach their own children at home &#65533; especially as they approach high school age. Q If I have three children I want to homeschool, do I have to teach three levels of math, science, and English each day? It&#65533;s not necessary for families homeschooling children in the early teen years to stress out about the higher math subjects. Aren&#65533;t we denying our children these things if we homeschool them? In homeschooling, we can create these activities for our children in an environment that is in harmony with our beliefs and values. I don&#65533;t want to mislead anyone that you can have these things for your children without putting in work and effort. It is much easier to jump into the car and take off to the desert to see the wildflowers with one than with five or six children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">A If you are new to homeschooling and don&#65533;t know where to begin, then a prepackaged curriculum could be ideal for you and your homeschooled child or children. A Probably not. A few subjects may require individual, separate teaching; but that is probably the exception rather than the rule. Many families in both categories solve this problem by pooling resources and hiring a tutor to instruct a small group (often 5 to 10 children) in a particular subject once or twice a week. Usually, this type of arrangement is conducive to a positive learning experience: The children know why they are there and want to be there, so it works out well for all. The Homeschooling Book of Answers: The 88 Most Important Questions Answered by Homeschooling's Most Respected Voices . She has worked with families and young children for 25 years in a variety of settings.</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">My observation of thousands of home-educated children over the past twenty years suggests that another factor outweighs any kind of peer or sibling interaction in its influence on social development. They are not segregated with age mates in a setting that is quite different from any other environment they will encounter in life. There is no conclusive research suggesting that time with same-aged peers is preferable to time with individuals of varying ages. This fluidity of social interaction allows children to play and learn in a group that matches his or her developmental level, while at the same time fosters a learning environment that truly supports healthy social interaction. Social development is the development of understanding of self in relationship to others. Children model their behavior from the people around them. Nearly two-thirds of the homeschooled individuals were self-employed, but only a few worked alone as craftspeople or in other solitary occupations, while most either provided employment to others or worked along with family members (Knowles, 1991).</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">The homeschooling rate was also higher for students in families with three or more children in the household than for students in families with fewer children, higher for students in two-parent households than for students in one-parent households, and higher for students in two-parent households with only one parent participating in the labor force than for students with other parent labor force participation patterns. A   Hardships such as living on one income, learning how to be together day in and day out, and having to re-learn or learn certain academic subjects at first may seem like negatives can be positives, homeschooling can lead to the greatest metamorphosis of your life! Q Are we losing a sense of community when we remove our children from school? A   No. You are building a true sense of community when you decide to homeschool if you also choose to meet with other homeschooling families and participate in the field trips, park days or play days, and any special programs they do. This category is for questions relating to the methods, theories, or general needs of educating your child from home. For questions on specific school subjects, please see the related category: School Subjects.</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">Planning and carrying out a good educational program for a child requires patience, courage, creativity, determination, persistence, energy, enthusiasm, optimism, and more patience. Someone has to decide on the activities used to expose learners to information and ideas, supervise day-to-day practice of skill development, and take responsibility for time-management techniques that establish realistic schedules and deadlines. Parents who want to homeschool youngsters with learning disabilities and Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder must be willing and able to maintain an orderly environment where such children can be productive in spite of their tendency to be disorganized. Two particularly well-known women who received homeschooling were Florence Nightingale and Eleanor Roosevelt. It is the parents' right to choose how their children will receive their education, and the government's job to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity for an education. A CBS TV show a few years ago called The Dark Side of Homeschooling highlighted the deaths of three homeschooled children at the hands of their mother, and two other cases of abuses of homeschooled children as well. It is true that horrible things have happened to some homeschooling kids, but in each of the cases profiled, homeschooling was not the cause of the problem.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">Those who are thinking about homeschooling their child can feel marginalized since it appears on the web as if all homeschoolers were sold on the idea from the beginning. After some problems in schools and maybe a school switch or two, some of the parents consider homeschooling as the best approach for their children. But those families who are forced to make a sudden decision to school their child at home may feel inadequate to the task at the beginning. You may have hit some initial homeschooling bumps that even made you ask, "What was I thinking?!" Homeschooling Denial and Isolation - I'm not like those other strange homeschooling families.

Step 1: Build Your Vision Before starting to homeschool, it is wise to carefully build a vision for your children and your homeschool. Homeschooling is achievable for the majority of families, but it is not easy. Every homeschooling family will inevitably encounter some challenging rough spots. Step 2: Get Your Finances in Order Homeschooling could be the most expensive decision your family ever makes. Yet there is a huge financial sacrifice that your family will have to make in order to homeschool. Let's take a hypothetical family of six where the wife could earn $28,000 per year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">A family with six children spaced two years apart will be homeschooling for 22 years. For this family, homeschooling will involve a sacrifice of $352,000. Do you see why you need a solid vision to undergird your homeschool efforts? New cars rust, but your children have an eternal existence in one of two distinct destinies. From a long-term perspective, you will never regret the financial sacrifice to homeschool your children. Young men will need to plan for a one paycheck family while choosing and preparing for a career in a society that no longer recognizes a family wage for the father. Older men may need to take some advanced training so that their income earning ability will be able to support a homeschooling family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">Your finances need to be solidly grounded in order to be successful in homeschooling. Step 3: Start Child Training &amp;amp; Discipline Early The number one reason for homeschool burnout is a lack of discipline. A computer can serve as a learning assistant for one child while you are teaching others. An overlooked way for fathers to prepare for homeschool teaching is to volunteer to teach other children in a C.C.D. class. Offer to teach a course for a nearby homeschool family in return for their teaching you the skills they have learned. Over the years we continued to allow our children to follow the magic that sparked their interests. They have been led down paths of study which have included learning about foreign language, animals, drama, theater makeup, orangutans and apes, fly fishing, singing, swimming, radio production and many more.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">They also immersed themselves in the lives of their community doing volunteer work at meal programs, radio stations, for political candidates, at pet stores, and clubs of particular interest. When necessary, they found tutors/mentors to help them learn the foreign language, develop their dramatic skill or help them refine their singing techniques. I hope that those of you who are just beginning to venture down the homeschool path can take from this story and the stories of others who have gone before you, the secure knowledge that your children will succeed in life as long as you offer them your support and guidance as they follow their unique and true path in the world. Each time our children ventured out in a new direction, David and I became more confident that we were on the right path. If we ever doubted that homeschooling was the right choice, we simply reminded ourselves of what I encountered when I worked in the schools. Gone are the days of wondering whether or not Christian or Georgina are "doing what they are supposed to be doing." As David and I come close to the time when we will have no children at home, I often find myself wondering why we ever gave our educational worries much consideration.</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">Their boredom more than once served as a motivator and spurred them on to long-term, creative learning ventures that neither David nor I could ever have planned. By teaching ourselves to focus on the positive rather than the negative, David and I learned to recognize that, indeed, we were on the right track after all. It took quite some time before I realized why David and I could fluctuate so easily between feeling so good about our decision to homeschool one day, and being so unsure of ourselves the next. Although Georgina's and Christian's authentic learning experiences were small miracles to behold, David's and my doubts could easily loom large when we saw how differently they went about their daily activities--their work--compared to our childhoods. Oddly enough, our doubts about whether or not our free-form approach to educating our children subsided after I took on work as a long-term substitute teacher in 1990. The stark contrast between the work that my children were doing and what my students were doing helped us put aside our concerns and know that our path, while still uncharted, was by far superior to the traditional approach to education. That year of substitute teaching was the same year that Georgina became immersed in the study of ancient Egyptian culture, an interest that began with her random browsing through books at the library.</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">We would read anything we could get our hands on--adult books, picture books, encyclopedias--it didn't matter what. Georgina was fascinated by anything to do with ancient Egypt. Some days we would sit on the kitchen floor and work on a scale model of an Egyptian city, some days we would talk about Egyptian hieroglyphics and on some days Egypt had nothing to do with our daily activity at all. Our days had a natural rhythm to them and we thoroughly enjoyed our discoveries together. On the first Monday in November this suddenly came to an end. As it happened, two of the students I was working with were studying ancient Egypt with their classmates. The first day that I sat in on the classroom discussion I was jarred by the unreality of it all.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">"Egypt," for these children, was something that was only discussed between 10:30 and 11:20 on certain days of the week. "Egypt" was memorizing the meaning of terms like "obelisk," "pyramid" and "mummy" for a multiple-choice test. "Egypt" was something to be forgotten when the class moved on to "Greece" two weeks later. Georgina and I discussed Egypt at breakfast or read about it for our bedtime reading. My students were reading texts for certain facts which they would be tested on and do worksheets on. Georgina was reading and being read to about something that fascinated her. There was no test or worksheet at the end to test what facts she had learned.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">My husband and I have been homeschooling our two children since 1978 when our first child was born. The purpose of this article is twofold, to show that the "harms of homeschooling" that West alleges basically have no foundation in research evidence and to note that West's proposal for the state to control homeschool parents and their children is based on a worldview that it is antithetical to one held by a significant portion of Americans. She begins by asserting that homeschooling that is not regulated more by the state is likely to harm children in several ways. She then moves on, from a particular but unspecified worldview, to propose government law and policies to control private homeschooling so that children and youth are less likely to be harmed. Similarly, Yuracko [5] argued that the state must increase its control over home education to make sure children and youth are exposed to "liberal values" (p. 10) and to "... check rampant forms of sexism in homeschooling" (p. 11). West's first explicit claim regarding the "harms" of homeschooling is as follows: "First, children who are homeschooled with no state regulation are at greater risk for unreported and unnoticed physical abuse, when they are completely isolated in homes" (p. 9). ..... Thus, deregulated homeschooling means that homeschooled children are basically exempted from immunization requirements.</paragraph><paragraph parID="124">West, however, provides no facts to support her claim that home-educated children "...are more susceptible to the diseases ..." This author knows of no such data. In fact, perhaps homeschool children, whether immunized or not, are healthier and less susceptible to the diseases to which West refers than those in institutional schools. For example, research findings consistently show that regardless of whether home-educated students are in low- or high-income families, have parents who are of low or high educational attainment, are engaged in a relaxed homeschool pedagogical environment or a highly structured one, have parents who hold to atheism, Buddhism, or Christianity, have none or many siblings, reside in states with low or high control/regulation over homeschooling, they, homeschool students, consistently score above average on academic achievement tests. This author does not know of any homeschool advocates who claim that no homeschool children are doing poorly academically. Furthermore, West's claim that homeschool children who are suffering her undefined "educational harm" would have such harm avoided had they been in public school or had all homeschooling been more controlled (regulated) by the state begs many questions. Which leads to another question begged by her claim about how educational harm would be lessened for homeschool children. Is she not concerned about "fundamentalist metaphysical naturalists" homeschooling their children?</paragraph><paragraph parID="125">It is true that some "fundamentalist Christians" are intentionally shielding their homeschooled children from certain curriculum, but West does not provide evidence to support this assertion. The husbands and wives in these families feel themselves to be under a religious compulsion to have large families, a homebound and submissive wife and mother who is responsible for the schooling of the children, and only one breadwinner. Homeschooling families spend lots of time learning and playing together and this naturally creates close ties between brothers and sisters and between children and parents. They even get along with their siblings, and it is common for homeschooling families to receive positive comments about their children's strong, warm sibling relationships. I am the father of 2 girls and a boy and I homeschooled all 3 with a remarkable degree of success. A few years ago, The Associated Press reported that homeschooled children are more likely than other students to live with two or more siblings in a two-parent family, with one parent working outside the home.

Their reasons for keeping their children at home are unique and varied.</paragraph><paragraph parID="128">Homeschooled children are required to pass a GED test in order to obtain a high school diploma, while 30% of high school graduates are incapable of passing the same exam. Research studies on homeschooled children already demonstrate the fact that homeschooled children score higher than their public school counterparts in every academic and social category in which they are tested. Homeschooling at least breaks parents and children out of the non-reality oriented school environment. Teaching children at home breaks parents and children out of the non-reality oriented thinking of the classroom, so parents are not as likely to try to segment a child's day into isolated subject matters, nor are they as likely to teach a subject such as math out of context and without connection to everyday life. Homeschooling eliminates the use of public humiliation in the learning process and usually reduces the negativity and hostility that are traditionally directed at children by educators in the classroom setting. When children are schooled at home, they are allowed to remain with their parents during the years before the age of ten, when such family contacts are essential to the child's mental and emotional well-being. Homeschooling parents who truly want to provide their children with a proper education will not allow their children to reach adolescence without developing a marketable skill.</paragraph><paragraph parID="129">If homeschooling parents want to make sure their children are properly prepared for adult life, they will help their children discover their own "natural find," a marketable skill that brings great personal satisfaction. Already, studies clearly show that homeschooled children are much better socially adjusted than their public school counterparts. Someone just beginning the classical homeschooling journey probably falls into one of two categories: those who are beginning homeschooling, and are starting their homeschooling journey with classical education, and those who are not new to homeschooling, but are new to classical education. CCH includes a page of favorite homeschooling resources in its online catalog , and the CE Loop has also posted a page of most helpful homeschooling materials . Next, the biggest challenge to new homeschoolers, and especially to those pursuing a classical education at home, is breaking out of the institutional mindset. Since all of us, as parents, were educated K-12 most probably in a public school, we bring our own experiences and expectations of what school ought to be to our homeschool. Homeschooling vs Public Schools: The Pros and Cons of Homeschooling</paragraph><paragraph parID="130">The decision of whether to home school a child or to send a child to public school is a personal one. There are several benefits and drawbacks to homeschooling. Homeschooling does not completely eliminate a student's chance to socialize with other children their age, but significantly reduces the amount of time spent interacting with others. This requires homeschooling parents to find social activities to ensure that their child receives enough social interaction to properly develop their social skills. While this is by no means an entirely negative aspect to homeschooling, it does require parents to research, register, pay for and attend additional activities solely for the purpose of socialization. Perhaps the most often discussed aspect of homeschooling is the ability for parents to control the curriculum. With homeschooling, parents can introduce the topics of study as well as the lesson plans covering that topic.</paragraph><paragraph parID="131">Purchasing pre-made home school curriculum materials can keep parents focused and on track. In a home school curriculum science, math and other subjects can be taught through religious texts and contain religious-themed lesson plans and assignments. A home school curriculum can, but does not need, to be religiously based. Some of these items, such as calculators, are easily obtainable by homeschooling parents, but others, such as chemicals are not. One of the biggest benefits to homeschooling is the ability for the curriculum and lesson plans to be adjusted to the student's learning style. It is very easy to spend more time on a subject if a parent feels the student has not yet grasped it completely, and it is also easy to breeze through a subject that the student masters faster than anticipated. This is one aspect of homeschooling that public schools often cannot match.</paragraph><paragraph parID="132">The chance of either of these occurring for homeschooled children is significantly less. Ultimately, the decision of whether to home school your child is a question of whether the program and curriculum of homeschooling vs public schools is a better fit for both you and your child. To find out more about the pros and cons of homeschooling, visit the sites below: Is Home Schooling Right for your Kids? : This article, provided by Family Matters Parenting Magazine, discusses questions for parents to consider when investigating whether to home school their children. At school students learn how to interact with other children and adults, appropriately respond to conflict and developing friendships. This provides parents with the means to reduce or eliminate altogether those aspects of a particular topic that they feel unnecessary or uncivilized.</paragraph><paragraph parID="133">Of course, state education laws often require parents to cover specific topics within subjects, but how those topics are handled is up to the parents. This may mean that a child does not receive instruction in some areas, particularly science. Moreover, lesson plans can be as creative and unique as a parent wants. Chemistry classes can take place in the kitchen and botany classes in the family's garden. This can result in students being bored due to not being challenged or to students falling behind because they required more instruction on the topic. This fall will be our family's 30th year of active homeschooling. Peter, who is 14, is entering the 9th grade-using the homeschoolish meaning of grade.</paragraph><paragraph parID="134">Okay, for those of you who are too literal and for the three truant officers in Oskaloosa, Walla Walla, and Poughkeepsie who subscribe to the Court Report to "monitor" the homeschooling movement so that you can pounce on the weak, let me say that, while Peter is at a variety of grade levels, he is not below grade level in any subject except advanced multiculturalism. Proper use of an answering machine in the homeschooling context begins with the greeting. You can't homeschool when you are on the phone. And as unfair as this may sound, even if you are giving advice to a caller interested in homeschooling, it still doesn't count as homeschooling. The new version of this maxim is-and I know this may sound like heresy to some- you can't be on Facebook and be homeschooling. Homeschooling requires that you focus all available attention on your children. Physical activity and sports are an important part of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="135">One day, when the kids were becoming just a smidge irritating-or as we say in the Farris home "acting like little pips"-I suggested that Vickie use a math game that I had heard of on the homeschool speaking circuit. You have heard the stories-you know ... the family with 12 children, all under age 9, whose 6-year-old has learned to solve three-variable algebra problems by studying the number of Hebrew syllables in the Pentateuch. When we began homeschooling, a curriculum fair could be held in a space the size of an airplane bathroom. There was only one vendor that was really willing to sell to homeschoolers. Nor can you engage in every activity that you would like to have your children pursue. You cannot attend every support group meeting you would like. You cannot keep your house in mint condition 24/7.</paragraph><paragraph parID="136">Your children may occasionally whine despite the ads you read in the homeschooling magazine that promised contented children. This is not to say that your house shouldn't be reasonably clean. There are nagging voices that like to whisper in the ears of a homeschooling mom-especially in your first few years. Your children are not going to master chemistry. I have taught several thousand homeschooled teenagers a course in constitutional law. I fear that the homeschooling movement has become so enamored with all of the bells and whistles of cool curriculum add-ons that we have forgotten some of the basics. Moms, if you are so exhausted from homeschooling at the end of the day that you have no time or energy to interact with your husband, you need to find an easier path.</paragraph><paragraph parID="137">If you wanted to do that fancy new classical curriculum, but it would take you 12 hours a day to pull it off-don't do it. Find a program that is easier on Mom. But she did not stop walking just because she was busy with homeschooling. Dad, you must also take as much of the load as you can manage in one of two areas: the academics of homeschooling or the care of the home. Your goal is to ensure that your wife knows from your actions that you are as committed to homeschooling as she is. Tell your kids why you are homeschooling them. If you want your children to share any of your convictions-biblical convictions, political convictions, or homeschooling convictions-it is not sufficient to just model these things or to teach them the facts in these areas.</paragraph><paragraph parID="138">Don't let anyone tell you that homeschooling is distracting you from more important spiritual duties in the church. There is a problem in the homeschooling movement of being too insular. While the lower court had concerns about the quality of the education received by two of the eight children, the trial court did not order the parents to enroll their children into a private or public school, and stated in its opinion that "parents have a constitutional right to school their children in their own home. Declaring that "parents do not have a constitutional right to home school their children," the Second District Court of Appeal for the state of California recently issued a ruling that effectively bans families from homeschooling their children and threatens parents with criminal penalties for daring to do so. According to the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) this court decision has made "almost all forms of homeschooling in California" a violation of state law. Once again our judicial system moves to restrict religious and personal liberties, severely limit parental rights, and significantly increase the power, scope, and control of the state over our lives. With the stroke of a pen the appellate court criminalized the lawful educational choices of tens of thousands of innocent families across the state, subjected them to possible fines, and labeled their children as potential truants.</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">This activist court chose to bypass the will of the people and legislated from the bench based on anecdotal evidence and its own clearly biased and subjective opinions about the constitutionality of parental rights and the quality of a homeschooled education. This decision attacks the freedom of parents to decide on the best educational environment for their children, restricts their religious rights to practice their faith without governmental interference, and violates their freedom to raise their offspring as they see fit without the ideological pollution and atheistic/leftist indoctrination so prevalent in our public school system. The court also conveniently turned a blind eye to the increasing levels of violence and murder in many California public schools, as well as the abysmal quality of education in those very same schools. With California ranking near the bottom in the quality of its public education system, a state-wide illiteracy rate of approximately 24 percent, and drop-out rates hovering around 30 percent, the California public education system is not the shining example and standard the courts should be applying and measuring against. On average, home schoolers outperformed their public school peers by 30 to 37 percentile points across all subjects. Similar studies documented by the HSLDA also confirm that the poor "socialization" objection by the court is a red herring. Numerous studies have shown that homeschooled youngsters have excellent social skills, are active in groups and community activities outside the home, engage in many extracurricular activities and sports, are exceptionally prepared to deal with the real world, interact better with adults and a variety of age-groups, and take their civic duties more seriously than their public school counterparts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">Fortunately the people of California and homeschooling associations across the country, outraged by these latest developments, are taking steps to proactively deal with and redress the situation. Many homeschooling families are determined to fight for their parental rights and countermand the court's decision. It has advised the Long family to appeal the decision to the California Supreme Court and it will file "an amicus brief on behalf of our 13,500 member families in California" arguing that the proper interpretation of California statutes allow parents to teach their own children under the private-school exemption. The HSLDA will also seek to have this decision "depublished," which can only be done by the California Supreme Court. "Parents should not be penalized for acting in the best interests of their children's education. This outrageous ruling must be overturned by the courts and if the courts don't protect parents' rights then, as elected officials, we will," he said. This year we have 5, plus our 4yo DGS.</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">My students will not be eligible like this for the state scholarship, but if their parents want to get them on Approved Home Study for the last two years of highschool they could. Like public/private, however, we must have (it just wouldn't work otherwise) a set yearly and daily schedule, and I give annual achievement tests just to be accountable to the parents. Homeschool basically means that a child is not publicly schooled by a government-run facility using a government-approved curriculum. We chose to homeschool due to our child's health (lethargy from radiation and chemotherapy) and due to the end results of EACH public school day that she attended. The kids were not like her in that they hit and stepped on her, broke her glasses, said mean things to and about her, kept themselves away from her in the form of cliques, and stole from her. After months of tears from our child, and disbelief on our part, we decided that it would help her to do her work at home where she could get the extra catnaps she was in need of and where she could be in an environment that was loving and good. Today, with one on one schooling at home, at the library, at the gym, in hotels while traveling to visit the place we are learning about, our children are enjoying school and doing well!</paragraph><paragraph parID="142">They attend gym classes with other homeschooled students as well as field trips, fun outings, and events. The homeschooled children we participate with are well-mannered children who can even be found to be nurturing to their own younger siblings. They treat each other well, use nice language, and speak about subjects that parents would approve of. Purchasing the newest curriculum and teaching tools can be very expensive. Home schooled children may not have as many opportunities to interact with other children in comparison to children who attend regular schools. Forming bonds and socializing with children their own age is important for the child's developmental health and development of social skills. If home schooled, they may be deprived of the chance to form friendships and may suffer socially.</paragraph><paragraph parID="143">The lack of socialization may affect them in later stages of life. It is quite impossible that a home can be as well-equipped as a regular school in terms of facilities. For classes that require experiments like physics and chemistry, it can be hard to get all the necessary chemicals, materials, apparatus, and so on. The home would also lack facilities for sports like swimming pools, running tracks, gyms, and fields. One of the reasons why homeschooling is bad is the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parents may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner. It is may be hard for parents to draw the line between educator and parent in the child's mind.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">One of the most glaring negative effects of homeschooling is the matter of motivation. Some children need to be challenged to excel in their studies. More parents are choosing to homeschool their children because they see the many benefits of homeschooling, differences in ideology and issues with public school policy are only a few reasons why some parents choose homeschooling over public or private schools. While there are many positive aspects of homeschooling, there are also the negative aspects of homeschooling. In this article, we will explore some of the disadvantages of homeschooling. When parents take the responsibility of educating their children at home, they may need to set aside time to make it work. The task of homeschooling a child is certainly not easy, especially for working parents, single parents or stay-at-home parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">They have to take time to organize and prepare lessons, teach, give tests, and plan field trips. In comparison to public schools, where education is free, homeschooling can be costly. There are also other costs to keep in mind, like project materials, stationery, books, computer software, and field trips. Parents who choose to home school their children should be prepared to spend more money than parents who send their children to public schools. Of course, they can make friends with other home schooled children, but it is quite different when special effort has to be made to arrange meetings. In this sense, they thrive when they are involved in some competition. Children who are homeschooled would not have this motivation because most of them are educated separately.</paragraph><paragraph parID="146">These parents think that educators are not doing enough pounding, beating and bashing of children to rid them of the devil within. Some parents keep their children at home because they realize there is something very wrong with the current educational system, and they do not want their children to be exposed to it. While the children will still come out way ahead of their public school counterparts, and with far less damage, these families will take at least three to five generations of homeschooled children before the "school" impressions are washed out. On the other hand, parents who homeschool their children simply because they think something is wrong with the current system, who want to he with their children and who have no axe to grind, can wash out these destructive effects in just two generations. The reason that homeschooled children come out ahead is two-fold. First, homeschooled children are protected from the permanent harm inflicted on all children exposed to the educational process. Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, homeschooled children have a better chance of fulfilling their own personal destinies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">These ideas include the notion of individual, personal destiny. Before the age of about ten years, young children are very vulnerable and susceptible to outside influences. During these early years, children are collecting themselves. They are collecting information about what they are, who they are, and how they are; about what they like and do not like, and about what they are interested in doing with their lives. Before the age of ten, children are trying to find out what the world is and how it works. Children are, in a sense, collecting themselves up to fulfill their own unique personal destinies. Another way of describing the opportunity of fulfilling one's destiny is to say that a person would have the chance to do the thing he or she is most interested in doing in life, and that doing this thing would bring great personal satisfaction.</paragraph><paragraph parID="148">It would be best for children if all parents let them be (at least before the age of nine or ten) and just spent time with them, taking them places and showing them things out in the world. It would be best if parents could take their children down to the railroad yard and sit and look at the trains, or take them to the river and watch the ships go by, or sit them up on the back of the tractor while mowing the field. It would be best if children could use all their own natural resources to find out who they are and how the world works. As a result, homeschooled children of all backgrounds generally have a much better chance of fulfilling their own destinies. Homeschooled children tend to develop a mind of their own. Homeschooling and Socialization Many people think that homeschooled children do not have enough interaction with other children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">Most homeschooled children are not isolated from other children. Since we began publishing these newsletters last year, we have received some letters from people who, for various reasons, are against the idea of homeschooling. We found it interesting to note that almost everyone who wrote to us saying they were against homeschooling listed "lack of socialization" as the major drawback to teaching a child at home. These letters imply that public education offers children a proper socialization experience. Children before the age of eight or nine are still learning social skills. They are learning social skills primarily from the adults in their environment, not from other children. When children go to school, their classroom teacher is the parent surrogate and the primary adult role model.</paragraph><paragraph parID="150">In other words, children in a classroom are learning social skills by observing the behaviors of their teachers, not their fellow classmates. Children who spend most of their time with adults are much more amenable and much more at ease in social situations than children who spend the majority of their time with other children. There is much empirical evidence as well as documented research to show that this is true. Children who attend school learn dysfunctional behaviors from their classroom teachers and they learn meanness and violence from their peers. School yard behaviors are a good example of the types of social behaviors that children learn from one another. The school environment is a hostile, mean place where hostile, mean things are done to children. Should we not all be more concerned about the "social skills" children are learning in school?</paragraph><paragraph parID="151">It must be mentioned that not all parents and children get along well enough with each other to promote the kind of relationship that is necessary for a homeschooling situation. Some parents and children do not like each other enough to homeschool. Many of these criteria are met simply by teaching children at home. Most homeschooling parents are extremely conscientious about providing their children with skills in reading, writing and mathematics. Homeschooling is an alternative method of teaching where the parent delivers an educational program to children at home. Distributed Learning (DL) should not be confused with Homeschooling, for more information on DL programs and the differences between the two, please review Distributed Learning verses Homeschooling information. The School Act , (section 12) provides parents with the statutory right to educate their children at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="152">Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and parents to blend family, life and schoolwork into their own schedule. Homeschooling is the full responsibility of the parent, is not supervised by a British Columbia certified teacher, is not required to meet provincial standards, and is not inspected by the Ministry of Education. It is the responsibility of the parent to provide and supervise the educational program. Immunization is an important part of protecting your child's health. Immunizations can be done at your family doctor's office or your local health unit. Registering Homeschooled Children Some of us feel we can provide a much higher quality of education at home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="153">We may want to teach our children from a Biblical world view. Some of our children do not learn well in a classroom setting, being easily distracted or bored. Many of us desire the close family unit that is possible by keeping our children together throughout the day instead of split up into age-segregated classes. Usually, we desire to keep contact with peer groups to a minimum, allowing our children to become who they are created to be. Finally, there is the recent issue of safety, or lack of it, in schools. We are expected to protect our children as we bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. "In a nutshell: we homeschool for our children."</paragraph><paragraph parID="154">The bottom line is that homeschooling is a lifestyle, and will require your resources and time. You need to be willing to do what is necessary to make the home education you provide an exercise in excellence and a delightful experience for your children. As parents, you need to determine whether homeschooling is something you are willing to do. It requires a commitment of time, both for planning and schooling itself, and financial resources to purchase school materials. I suggest each family seek the Lord for a vision for their family. Join a local homeschooler's group, attend meetings and visit with veteran homeschoolers. Ask lots of questions and take notes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="155">Submit every idea, decision, opportunity, curriculum choices, etc. to your husband. If your husband does not support your homeschooling, except in extreme circumstances, you should not pursue it at this time. Write out your "vision" for your homechool. What do you want it to be like. Write out what you think your day will be like. This is your homeschooling paradigm. Be prepared to let it die completely and allow the Lord to give life to the homeschool He would like to build in your home.</paragraph><paragraph parID="156">Submit all of the above to the Lord. Commit your way to Him. Providing a visual context helps these children to understand the idea or concept being taught. Older students should be taught to take notes while studying and/or listening to lectures to reinforce visually what they are hearing. They learn best through hands-on activities, in every subject. They are not content to merely observe , but must touch and manipulate everything they encounter. Unit Studies are ideal for these hands-on children because each fact or concept is taught through activities and reinforced in each subject.</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">If unit studies are too labor-intensive for parents, field trips, crafts, activities, projects or whatever else you can imagine will bring any subject to life. Auditory Learners receive and retain information best through listening: reading aloud by a parent or sibling, story tapes and books on tape. Lectures can be performed and recorded by a parent that has a flair for the dramatic. History and story tapes can be found that would enhance any homeschool, but especially appeal to the auditory learner. Traditional homeschooling is similar to classroom learning, using textbooks, workbooks and traditional teaching methods. This is often the best place for new homeschoolers to begin because of the availability of a complete curriculum. Some believe, though, that the term "traditional homeschooling" is an oxymoron because they are antithetical.</paragraph><paragraph parID="158">How can homeschooling be traditional since it is in opposition to school learning? Many families do adopt traditional teaching methods in their homeschool because these methods are tried and true for the classroom-type learner. In a nutshell, we homeschool for our children. Unit Studies take a topic and build lessons around this topic using library books, activities and crafts to increase retention of the material. For younger grades, its focus is on hands-on activities that make learning fun. Books are read aloud to the younger children. Eclectic homeschooling is what most of homeschoolers do when they choose to teach the Trivium, use living books, have your children narrate to you what they just read, do a unit study when you begin learning about Ancient Egypt or Light and Color, and have lots of manipulatives of all kinds in your home for every subject.</paragraph><paragraph parID="159">Okay, this is almost an exagerration, but actually describes our homeschool to a tee. I have read books on almost all homeschooling methods over the last 12 years and have tried different aspects until I found the aspects that fit with our homeschool. Because I also have special needs children, I could not embrace any one method excluding all others because my children just don't learn one way. In math, one might do well with a Saxon Math textbook alone. My daughter needs to use a large chalkboard and manipulatives in order to master a concept. My 12yo hates manipulatives because they slow him down. My 9yo has been reading for 5 years, but is barely writing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="160">We make adjustments. There is no way he could take notes and write summaries of his reading assignments. He does almost all of his school work using computer curriculum. This is the eclectic homeschooling family! This year my daughters are in 7 th and 4 th grade and we are in the middle of Indiana geography/history and the Renaissance. To honor these two main lessons in a living way we decided to do two field trips. The first was called Feast of the Hunters Moon, a reenactment of the French and Indian trading post lifestyle at Fort Ouiatenon in Lafayette, Indiana.</paragraph><paragraph parID="161">The reenactment is right on the river, on the original trading post/ fort site and is set up just for one weekend each fall. The reenacters live on the site all weekend and try to live and cook as much as possible in an authentic way. We first wandered around a Wea Indian village, watching a game of Indian lacrosse and listening to native speakers. We moved on to the block house trading post with furs on the wall and demonstrations of how the voyageurs carried their trade goods and protected them in their canoes. We went down to the voyageur camp and saw the colorful canoes and the encampment of the voyageurs. We watched French Canadian dances and munched on corn roasted in the husk. We moved over to the early colonial troop encampment with all the soldiers in military uniforms and looked at a variety of early colonial trades and crafts like the cooper, the blacksmith, the pewter and silversmith, the leather shop, the wood carver, the milliner, the paper maker and lots more.</paragraph><paragraph parID="162">My daughters were fascinated by some crafts that were new to them like tatting but knowledgeable on others like making pine needle baskets. They talked to the traditional craftswomen with ease and really enjoyed watching the spinning and dyeing of wools in the big kettles and feeling soft alpaca wool. We nibbled on free samples of warm water bread and walked until we were truly tired. We came home a bit smoky from all the open fires in the encampment but feeling as if we had experienced a colorful and living slice of Indiana history. Our second field trip was to the Ohio Renaissance Fair with a time period of Elizabethan England. This was a more commercial set up with thirty acres of buildings and open spaces that stay up from year to year but it was well done. We began by watching a hilarious comedy team of two swordsmen that were quite talented with their blades and got the audience very involved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="163">Everyone that either entertained or ran a shop stayed in character and was dressed in period costume. We moved on to watch a marvelous stone cutter who did beautiful designs in limestone and then the girls got their hair braided in a French type braid using long leather strips woven into their hair. We then watched a joust with knights in full armor on marvelous big horses and huzzahed for our champion (who happened to lose). This was a friendly joust of course but the men were really breaking their long wooden lances when they clashed. We continued on to watch some country dancing near the maypole and then we all had a chance to weave the ribbons of the maypole&#151;there were at least 20 people weaving amidst some laughter as 6 foot tall men ducked under the ribbons of 8 year olds! We wandered through Renaissance type arcades like archery shooting and throwing knives at targets and boys being spun around in large barrels by a burly man. We saw a talented stunt man/acrobat performing on the Gloriana Stage and we laughed at another comedy routine called Washing Wenches set in a field in front of a small pond where the ladies had lots of country humor and made several audience males do silly things.</paragraph><paragraph parID="164">We watched a glass blower working on a large vase for about 20 minutes and were reminded again of what a difficult craft it is. We poked into dress shops and heraldry shops and saw the latest Renaissance jewelry fashions. We watched an improvisational story teller with a very funny take on Sinbad the Sailor and my husband was one of the people picked to shout out &#147;plot twist,&#148; which would require the story teller to change his story&#146;s direction. The girls really appreciated his improvisation abilities. The girls tried on a short vest of chain mail that weighed ten pounds and learned how the craftsman did his work. We saw jugglers and fools and listened to tavern sailor singers and bought some incense sticks that were fragrant with natural amber and other exotic smells. We took lots of costume photographs since many of the people that came as visitors were also dressed in period costume and some were quite amazing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">Perhaps this Fair was not quite as historically authentic but I appreciated the Elizabethan humor and the efforts everyone made to stay in character. I think the whole family came away with some wonderful memories and a real sense of living history. It also helped that the weather cooperated, especially for the Renaissance Fair, so we could comfortably walk in the crisp autumn sunshine. These field trips take some advance planning and the Renaissance trip was a three hour car ride one way, but it was well worth the effort. Both of our field trips have enhanced my daughters understanding and helped to create living pictures of their main lessons. September means the fall, the start of homeschooling and for our family, the start of our seasonal business known as Happy Hearts, run by my two daughters (ages 12 and 10) and myself. This little business of ours has gone on for 15 years, and as one group of my children left the business, the younger ones have taken it over.</paragraph><paragraph parID="166">It all began when my five year old twins went into my purse and took some money. They didn&#146;t try to hide anything- they just took it! I tried to explain that they had to ask a parent before taking money. So, I took the money back and thought that settled it. Two days later, they had raided their eight year old brother&#146;s piggy bank. I believe they thought that brothers were fair game. So I had a slightly more direct talk about taking things from anyone and mentioned the word stealing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="167">They looked at me with those adorable blue eyes and said &#147;so how does money work? I realized then that I was in a teachable moment. So I took them out to our garden ripe with pumpkins and squash and explained that money comes in when someone sells something that another person would like. I casually mentioned that if we sold our squash to people in the neighborhood we would get paid money for it. Their response was &#147;Let&#146;s do it now! &#148; And that is how Happy Hearts began-going around the neighborhood with a cart full of our produce. Eventually the business expanded beyond the neighbors since we live out in the country and don&#146;t have that many.</paragraph><paragraph parID="168">The boys thought about what things we had in our house and woods that people might like to buy. At first it was little leaf light window decorations and other fall decorations along with flower seeds sold locally but soon we joined the ranks of holiday catalogs. As the boys learned more natural crafts and eventually some woodworking, it went into the small catalog that we mailed to friends around the country every September. Our last day of business was always around December 6 so our family could focus more on the holiday season. The boys also learned to run a real business- to consider inventory, cost of goods sold and their profit margin and how to divide the work up between the three of them fairly. I fronted their initial inventory costs but I had to be paid back first from the sales. They were always happy when the chart they kept showed that they had finally taken in orders beyond the costs of the inventory.</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">Production was one of the hardest lessons for them. Sometimes we actually had a lot of work and they had to be responsible to get an order out within a week whether they wanted to or not. As they became teenagers, their interests turned to other things and jobs out in the wider world. But by this time, my little girls really wanted to carry on what their big brothers had done. I had to help them a great deal at first but I soon realized that they were not only enthusiastic but quite resourceful and disciplined. The last two years, they have also had the patience to sit all day in a booth at a community craft fair (the only children there) and at a noisy school gym for another neighborhood craft fair evening. This year I had to tell my girls that I was busier than ever working from home at two part time jobs as well as homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">I told them that they would have to be very well organized and self motivated if the business was going to succeed. They assured me they would do it and promptly pared down some of our slow selling items and took on some more challenging jewelry and sewing work. They are determined to match their brothers&#146; $1000 year and tithe $100 to the rainforest so they can buy an acre of land to protect it. I admire their idealism and their entrepreneurial spirit and this just might be the year they make that goal. And I remember that in the turning seasons of our lives, this little business and homeschooling itself is truly a family labor of love. It can feel like an overwhelming task to consider planning a new academic year of homeschooling for one child let along multiple age children. Now my 9 to 5 type scheduling life revolves around homeschooling my two daughters (ages 10 and 12) , a 20 hour a week at home computer job and my consulting work for Christopherus.</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">As I consider my preparation for a new academic year, the first things I always reflect on are the rhythms of my life, seasonal, monthly, weekly and daily, in order to celebrate my life and space and the life and space of my family. Our family is a little microcosm of the organic in-breath and out-breath here on the earth. Some of the planning that I do for that is probably quite personal to me but other parts that I will share should be generally applicable to homeschoolers. SPRING PLANNING: Overall assessment of current year and family goals for festivals/celebrations/travel. Every spring (generally April, May) as the current year winds down, I begin the looking forward process to the next year. I ask myself what worked in the current year and what didn&#146;t. I consider how my children are developing on many levels and what I need to do to keep &#147;drawing forth&#148; the gifts that are within them, waiting to be released to the world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="172">I look at where I might have overcommitted myself and where I might need to simplify things in order to maintain or create a healthy rhythm to my homeschooling life. I generally am able to do this much better once my garden is planted (generally by the second week in May) Our children come to us to learn - human beings do not, like Athena, spring ready made and fully knowledgeable from their parents (or from their parents' head, as in Zeus' case!) Sometime in June, before we leave for Maine in July, I create a list of all the main lessons for my two daughters that will be covered in the next year. I think about how my two daughter&#146;s main lessons (4 th and 7 th for this new year) will &#147;breathe&#148; well together. I try to balance academic subjects so that there is a breathing in and out between the main lesson subjects as well. I consider carefully what co-op classes I will offer for our homeschooling community and the general season they will be offered.</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">I will also have to teach the coop classes for each of my daughters on different days since I no longer have my co-teacher helping me as she is busy at home with two high school students. Once I have a basic feeling for the months of the main lessons and how they fit with our family goals, I type up a main lesson schedule for both girls together (along with major vacations and festivals) and post it on the wall by my computer. LATE SUMMER PLANNING: Firming up the schedule, lesson plan prep, scheduling field trips and extra-curricular activities; staying flexible! We are starting at the same time as the public school next week because we want to be able to take that graduation trip in May as a family and still finish up by June 1. I am also working about an hour a night in preparation for the coop classes in September and because I will hand out a written assignment about Africa&#146;s eco-regions to each student to complete prior to the first class so that we can create a map from our regions in the first class since I had to cut a week out of the schedule of that coop class. Today I am scheduling extra-curricular activities such as dance lessons (that at least has no schedule change this year), finding a photography mentor for Alana and interviewing new piano teachers since our best friends that are leaving were also their music teachers! I have penciled in two field trips- one for the Renaissance Festival in Ohio and one called the Feast of The Hunters Moon which is a re-creation of the annual fall gathering of the French and Native Americans that took place at a fur trading outpost in the mid- 1700&#146;s on the banks of the Wabash River in Indiana.</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">My youngest has also told me today that she wants to work into her lessons a study on dinosaurs and their relationship in size to human beings. So, we are basically off and running to the library tomorrow to get out books on South America to begin that Geography lesson next week and to begin local geography with Rhea. Family meals are a very important part of that daily rhythm. Instead I sat in disbelief and felt my heart sink because those children could not experience the excitement of studying Egypt the way Georgina had. It was at that moment, and many others that followed, that I began to feel truly confident that David and I were on the right path. They have been led down paths of study which have included learning about foreign language, animals, drama, theater make-up, orangutans and apes, fly fishing, singing , swimming, radio production and many more. They also immersed themselves in the lives of their community doing volunteer work at meal programs, radio stations, for political candidates, at pet stores, and at clubs of particular interest.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">Each time our children ventured out in a new direction David and I became more confident that we were on the right path. If we ever doubted that homeschooling was the right choice, we simply reminded ourselves of what I encountered when I work in the schools. Of course they are! As the years rolled on, it seemed to us that our young children were mastering the basic skills of life quite successfully with little guidance from us. Christian learned to read, Georgina showed an interest in the written word but was not ready to master reading, and both children seemed to be happy and outgoing. By homeschooling our children we were giving them endless opportunities to work through their differences and learn the intricacies of living closely with one another. Those early days of homeschooling were both a joy and a frustration.</paragraph><paragraph parID="176">Even though David and I could recognize that our children were making progress in their personal and educational development, we still worried. Georgina was definitely a "late reader" and Christian's "allergy" to writing caused us to think of him as a "non writer." These issues combined with the often invasive questions about our educational choice and whether or not we were harming our children by keeping them at home kept staring us in the face. We'd often find ourselves asking, "Are we on the right track?" We found it easy to doubt ourselves when we focused on our children's "difficulties" with reading and writing or on "bad" days. It took us a little time, but soon we learned to focus ourselves on the positive aspects of homeschooling. We reminded ourselves, when we worried about academic issues, that our children were not becoming stagnant.</paragraph><paragraph parID="177">They always seemed to be mastering new skills whether it was how to use the telephone to make inquiries, tie their shoes, cook a meal or spell the name of a new friend. With such reminders, it became easier to assuage our doubt and replace it with a new found confidence in our children's ability to learn and grow according to their inner voices rather than our schooled expectations. When we were confronted by a series of "bad days," which might be marked by quarreling or endless boredom, it was important to remind ourselves that these, too, were learning opportunities. Our children were thriving, happy and curious about their world. They fit in socially with adults and children in our community of friends. Another large dose of doubting ourselves as homeschoolers came from direct observation of our children and what they were doing and not doing. I remember being concerned because my children were not doing those things which I had half-heartedly expected them to do.</paragraph><paragraph parID="178">They did not naturally gravitate to sitting still for hours on end nor did they seek out textbooks when they wanted to learn about something. For quite some time, they were the only people I had long-term first-hand relationships with who learned in this way. Oddly enough, our doubts about whether or not our free form approach to educating our children subsided after I took on work as a long-term substitute teacher in 1990. For example, the Co-op: by leaving the house just one day a week, my children get sports, religious formation (and sometimes confession), academic classes, art, music and dance instruction, and violin lessons for the older children. In one long day, all my children's homeschooling needs are met - social, academic and sports - and we can stay home the rest of the week. One large family told me this rule, and the farther you live from activities the more important in gas and time this becomes. Last, but not least, keep Sunday for family activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">Daddy never works on Sunday, so he can be with his family. The children need to be with their parents, because we are homeschooling for the sake of our family life, not to improve their social life. It is, however, a great day to entertain-just remember to invite the whole family. As I once again fall into the routine of driving to and from my four oldest girls' weekly dance classes, each on a different day and time, and some twice weekly, I wonder if it's really worth it. The two oldest are now in their ninth year of classical ballet and Broadway tap. The oldest is beginning her third year "en pointe" and the next in line is beginning her first. On a cultural level, dance education offers a variety of benefits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">Ballet especially will expose them to classical music. This gained awareness of and appreciation for classical music, as well as many other styles, can inculcate a lifelong love of music. We can't overlook the foreign language benefits either, for most of the terms used in classical ballet are French, but there are linguistic contributions from Italian and Russian as well. Of course, worthwhile dance education is not limited to ballet and tap. Your family may prefer jazz, lyric, modern, folk, Irish step, or even flamenco. All require hard work and dedication and will result in rewards that will last a lifetime. How do we juggle babies, toddlers, and the regular homeschool schedule, not to mention the household schedule, with these seemingly extraneous activities?</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">Many families have their own way of dealing with outside activities. What works for one family may not work for another. I drive two daughters to violin lessons and five of the children to Irish Dancing classes, both once a week. Our dancing is wonderful for large, multi-age families as it is "one stop" rather than different times and days for each child. My advice for deciding what to do and what not to do is first, pray about it, and second, ask your husband. On many occasions my wonderful husband has stepped in - seeing the true needs of our family, which include a well-rested, cheerful Mom - to veto an activity. Husbands can be our best resource for perspective on extracurricular activities!</paragraph><paragraph parID="182">Second, we think it is a positive benefit to have our children relating to other instructors and interacting with both homeschooled and non-homeschooled peers. Keeping up with housework in addition to teaching the children can be stressful and stress can lead to bad temper. Parents who get easily upset may find it difficult to homeschool, particularly if their child is one who gets easily frustrated. Homeschooling parents need to find the necessary materials and provide guidance for their children. Flexible Scheduling Homeschooled children can spend more time learning about their favorite topics in great depth and those topics can be connected to other subject lessons. Children can be enrolled in community programs - choirs, theater, sports - all of which will allow them to spend time with other children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="183">Parents should learn about these laws before committing to homeschooling since some require quite a bit of time. For example, children can spend an entire afternoon on math or geography or the subject of their choice. Flexible scheduling can be ideal for gifted children since they often love to immerse themselves in a topic before moving on to the next. Although the flexibility of homeschooling makes it easy for parents to nurture the strengths of their child, they must also be sure to help a child strengthen a child's weaker areas as well. Schools should also allow homeschooled children to participate in extracurricular activities (but not usually to spend time in classes). Homeschooling co-ops also provide opportunities to socialize. For example, in some states, parents need to submit their curriculum and in some cases some lesson plans for approval.</paragraph><paragraph parID="184">Other states, however, require only that parents declare that they will be homeschooling their children. Still other states require something in between these two. What kind of curriculum should be used? Finding a local homeschooling group can be helpful. Homeschooling is clearly a significant element in the efforts to raise up generations of children to become those who do not embrace freedom (as progressive homeschoolers like to claim for themselves) but to end democratic pluralism as we know it. The challenges of homeschooling many children on a tight budget can easily bring me down. The days are never long enough, there is always something that we need, or that would make our adventures easier, and the kids are always ready to... PLAY!</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">In my visions of homeschooling grandeur, I often thought my children would be self motivated learners. My hopes included them waking up every morning ready for me to impart knowledge to them- with books in hand - eagerly waiting for me in our schoolroom...I soon realized this was just a dream( I'm still holding out - maybe one dayJ). Seriously, the real world that we live in involves ME keeping the kids motivated and excited about learning. Often this motivation comes at a high price. I have found that there are certain types of curriculum that inherently keep the kids more interested. I have also found that if I add things to our routine that they "love" to do... it gets them into it. Time and time again I have come across students who will assert that they absolutely hate math.</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">They aren't really that old, and haven't gone very far down the road of life to have formed such a solid opinion of a subject that is used in daily life. Yet, I've seen it time and time again... math is hated because of how it is approached with these children. 1) Of course, you need to have a nice set of multiplication table flashcards, groups of things (pencils/crayons/or other objects). Various loose objects to use for skip counting practice. Homeschooling more than one child at different grade levels turns the difficulty up several notches.

If you are already living off the grid, you probably planned your garden, planned your budget, and prepared in every way before diving into this new lifestyle. Educating your children at home is likely another part of your planned-out, self-sufficient family life. Even if you are not off the grid yet, planning for homeschooling is one way to start to get out of the rat race. I'm sure you've heard the arguments a thousand times from your critics: Homeschooled kids are anti-social, they don't know how to cope in the real world, or even that homeschoolers are social outcasts.

My children are more talented than gifted, (although the younger of the two who was labeled ADHD in school now qualifies for gifted programs). I have spent our last four years of homeschooling helping my children develop their talents. The problem with developing talents is that the possibilities are innumerable and helping a child to find his or her niche is difficult at best.</paragraph><paragraph parID="192">Homeschooling holds an obvious advantage because as a parent, you are given an opportunity to be completely hands-on with your child&#65533;s education. Surveys have shown that many parents in the US now prefer homeschooling for their children's education. Many parents say that homeschooling is their best alternative of a child's education. Homeschooling is an alternative form of education that is fast growing. There are approximately two million people in the country today that undergo homeschooling. Some families want to build up their family ties; homeschooling offers the parents freedom to create and pattern individualized and specific curriculum, safety reasons, peer pressure and discontentment with the school system. For many, the public school systems have not met the needs of many parents.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">Homeschooling Milestones by Alison McKee   Although I was unaware of it at the time, my life as a homeschooling parent began on income tax day in 1978. During the course of the next few months, I was actively involved with the legislative process of writing and passing a decent homeschooling law for Wisconsin homeschoolers. For the next few years, we anxiously looked forward to becoming "real" homeschoolers; i.e., when Christian became "school" age. I don't remember thinking that our homeschooling venture really began until we got to Madison in mid-September, 1983. It dawned on me that, for my children, homeschooling didn't really exist because schooling, as most of us understand it, had no concrete meaning for them. So we'd passed yet another homeschooling milestone. Throughout our homeschooling years, there were many ups and downs.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">At these times we carefully considered our options: School, homeschooling with a traditional curriculum or unschooling. And most importantly, homeschooling is actually forcing the public to take notice of the condition of America's public schools (Bauman, 2001). Children given the proper atmosphere and opportunity will prosper and do well in life. It has been determined that minority and white students test out at equivalent levels when they are homeschooled (Gillespie, 1997). American homeschoolers do have a proclivity for association. The homeschool movement is not collective with a singular mode of thinking, unlike that of the public schools today (Taylor, and Hughes, 2003; Mintz, 2003). Each family determines their own reasons for homeschooling, they might very well be religious, but more often the motivation for homeschooling appears to be the failure of public school education (Rado, 1999; Rudner, 1999).</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">Homeschool parents are finding their American heritage, and concluding that it does not take a governmental autocracy to educate a nation (Grigg, 1997; Heston, 1997; Kang, 2001; Krueger, 2000; Lieberman, 2000). Due to a lack of central command, many homeschool organizations often make claims for all homeschoolers. In fact, many people have claimed to be homeschool experts, but are nothing more than opportunists. Since homeschooling is made up of varying groups with different ideals, there can be no single claimant that speaks for all homeschoolers; there are no homeschool experts in America today (Sealhoff, 2000). Specific minority homeschool support groups have also enhanced minority participation through the sharing of information (Hegener, 2000). Homeschooling for religious reasons Another big reason for homeschooling is religion (Bielick, Chandler, and Broughman, 1999).</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">Better education at home Yet again, all too often many public school advocates consider homeschoolers either racist or fanatics (Clowes, 1995; Danehy, 1999; Goldfarb, 1999). With all this said, opponents of homeschooling still contend that public education is the only avenue for true racial integration and learning (Schlafly, 2000). Homeschool parents have witnessed this failure first hand, and have decided to exit public schools for the development of their children (Kang, 2001). As long as they are free of institutionally supported racism, minority students perform as well as white students; they are able to fully meet their true potential in a loving parentally supported homeschool environment. An individual choice There are also many families who do not participate or align themselves with an organization (Bielick, Chandler, and Broughman, 1999; Colson, 2000; McElroy, 2001; Sealhoff, 2000).</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">This fractional separation gives the homeschool movement its strength to survive and succeed well into the future (Drennan, 2000). With each family making singular decisions, independent of any central control mechanism, success is actually deemed a triumph for each family over America's educational monopoly (Cardiff, 1998; Colson, 2000; Ellis, 2003). A supportive community Racism claims have been made evident in public schools as well as with homeschooling (Danehy, 1999; Boyden, Johnson, and Pittz, 2001). Teachers are leaving public school education due to a lack of professionalism, and collapsing educational standards. Due to this continued shortage many school districts are forced to import teachers from overseas under the H-1B visa program (Roberts, 2003). Many school districts have had to offer signing bonuses, reduced housing costs, and restaurant discounts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">School districts are also forced into hiring retired military personnel and educated immigrants from foreign countries (Learning Machines, Inc., 2001). While concerned parents have decided to leave public education for the betterment of their children, public educators continue to espouse a failed system (Malkin, 2002). Teacher shortages are only one of many growing complaints of public education (Sappenfield, 2002). The public school systems main concern is the self-preservation of its tax-subsidized teachers, not educational enlightenment. Public education today may be bordering on malpractice (Malkin, 2002). American homeschooling parents decide to teach their children for a variety of reasons. Indeed, an increase in public school drug use, gang activity and violence has been found to be additional reasons for parents to homeschool their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="199">Socialization of homeschooled children. A lack of socialization in homeschooling is a common theme espoused by opponents of America's homeschool movement. Homeschooled children develop normally with regard to social skill development. Homeschooled children are neither aided by nor diminished by their homeschooled environments (Clery, 1998). Home-based charter schooled students were not negatively influenced with regard to their homeschooled experiences and socialization capabilities (Butz, 2001). Research asserts that parents who homeschooled primarily sought a solid education for their children (Miles, 1995). Many parents do not know that they can, in fact, homeschool their children if they want to do so.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">Homeschoolers fear any influence that might allow a departure from their plans for educating their children, arguing that governmental regulations have led to the failure of America's once proud educational establishment. Both parties know very well that homeschool children do well with regard to test scores and social development (Schlafly, 1995; Schlafly, 2000). Recently my family and I heard a talk to parents at the first annual Northern California Homeschooling Association meeting. Criticism of current public and/or private school education, by itself will not help homeschooling parents thoughtfully and deliberately engage the ideas they must consider if they are to be of benefit to their children. It is up homeschoolers to make sure that they obtain only qualified people talk to them in homeschooling meetings. The people who talk to homeschooling families must have accurate knowledge and make thorough presentations to parents about the important issues and questions that pertain to the education of their children and adolesccnts. Good feelings and wishes about homeschooling will not build its success.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">An accurately informed homeschooling community can. I have been homeschooling using a different educational model. I read that you used to use Charlotte Mason educational theory in your homeschool, and switched from it to classical education. Charlotte Mason was an educator in Victorian England, at a time when the only method in use in England was the classical method. The similarities, of course, are that they both attempt to define a modern way of implementing classical education in the home school. What is the difference between the classical education of Classical Christian Homeschooling and the classical education of The Well-Trained Mind? Everett Reimer, who died in 1998, worked with Illich at the Center for Intercultural Studies (CIDOC) in Mexico in the early 1970's, and the two men published separate books about their joint research.</paragraph><paragraph parID="202">Most comprehensive bibliographies on alternative education will include these titles, and the roots of today's homeschooling movement can be traced back to them. When John Holt's book Teach Your Own: A Hopeful Path for Education (New York: Dell) was published in 1981, it quickly became the front-runner in a then-small selection of books about taking or keeping kids out of school. Five years later John Holt founded the newsletter Growing Without Schooling , which became a tactical handbook for thousands of families seeking to regain control of their childrens' education. Homeschooling, like public schooling, faces ever-increasing challenges, but the greatest threat to homeschooling may be its own unquestionable success. The word 'homeschooling' has become a much-sought-after appellation, appearing in advertisements for educational toys, distance learning, computer software, and school district alternative education programs. The term has developed a certain cachet, so it now has a perceived "selling power." But like the word 'organic,' which once meant grown without chemicals and now merely seems to mean grown, the word 'homeschooling' is losing all functional meaning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">The partial lie - no, the perfect lie - is that what may come to pass for homeschooling in the years ahead will work as well. Time4Learning appeals to a wide range of learning styles. I homeschool my two sons, ages 12 and 11. Living in Portland, we also have many choices for extracurricular activities to enhance our homeschool experience. Time4Learning is a fun software, entertaining and I really like the way it explains things in a way that the kids can understand, without making it boring. During the morning, I do preschool with my daycare children which leaves my children to their own devices of following a schedule I created. They get to watch an educational show of my choice and write about it by filling out a pre-made form.</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">The shows change daily, but programming is from National Geographic Channel, Discovery Channel, History Channel, etc. They also do their free reading during the morning. After lunch, during the daycare nap time, we get down to business using T4L. I bounce back and forth between them, observing, helping, etc. This continues until about 3:00 p.m. The afternoon is spent outside for p.e., weather permitting, or inside being creative with Lego's or working on art. I have already created a fall schedule which will allow us more time to pursue other activities, plus allows for more structure during the school day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">Every other Friday, both my husband and I are off work and we do some extra-curricular activity as a family -- which is wonderful! What Do Parents Say? It made the transition into homeschooling a lot less stressful for my whole family! I have been educating my six children at our home in Oregon for the past 12 years. The younger five are all still at home, although a daughter will graduate this year. In 2005, I began looking for an efficient, computer-based program that would cover the basics, leaving us more time to pursue the unit studies we enjoy as a family. My younger children can't remember when Time4Learning wasn't part of our school day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">On the parent forum you can ask questions about Oregon homeschooling resources. If you have a more private question, you can email me on the parent forum under the user name "hearthstone_academy". Oregon Homeschooling Info Oregon's Requirements for Homeschoolers Oregon homeschoolers are required to do two things: Notify the school district where you reside of your intent to homeschool. If your child has never attended a public school, this needs to be done the year your student turns 7.</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">If you are withdrawing your child from public school, notification needs to be given within 10 days of the date of withdrawal. Have your child's progress in math and language arts evaluated at the end of grades 3, 5, 8, and 10. Time4Learning started out as a supplement, but has now become more of a center piece to our homeschooling. We became a homeschooling family and never looked back. Our six children have a full spectrum of abilities and challenges, and they have all benefited from the one-on-one tutoring that homeschooling makes possible. How Kelly's Family Met the Oregon Homeschool Legal Requirements Our school district provides an online form for homeschool notification.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">You must provide the student's and parents' names and address, the student's birthday, and the name of the last school the student attended, if any. If you use a district provided form, you are not obligated to answer other questions that might appear on the form. Testing Options There are several private schools in our town who welcome homeschoolers when they are testing their own students. Schools order testing materials months in advance, so start inquiring early if you hope to use this method. Your school district may be able to provide you with a list of independent testers in your area. There is only one tester in our area and we enjoyed having her come to our home to test our children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">In addition, Basic Skills will send a tester to your Oregon town if you have a group of students to test. In the six short months we have been doing this, I have watched my sons flourish and grow! In the lesson, you can click on the highlighted word and hear it spoken. The Homeschooling Community Oregon public schools are required to allow homeschoolers who meet grade criteria to participate in extracurricular activities, including sports and cheerleading. An annual curriculum fair is held in Portland where our family has been introduced to a variety of curricula, often having an opportunity to meet a book's author or a program's developer. The state capitol, Salem, holds an annual "Homeschool Days" function where homeschoolers are welcome to take part in a variety of political activities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">Importance of Homeschooling In these present times, getting the best education for your children is of the utmost importance. This has resulted in a growing movement of parents taking the education of their children into their own hands. Home schooling continues to grow and to expand as more and more parents realize the many benefits and advantages of teaching at home. It has always been accepted that parents have an inherent right to determine how to raise and educate their children. However, it is important for you as a parent to also understand the disadvantages as well. When most people think of home schooling, what comes to mind is usually basic information that's not particularly interesting or beneficial.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">But there's a lot more to home schooling than just the basics. It has been shown that these results are increasing every year. Nowadays, a lot of parents choose homeschooling as their option for their children's education. Recent statistics shows that families in the US who now prefer homeschooling for their children have already reached 27%. Looking through the vast resources available on the world wide web under the subject of home-schooling, it could be seen that there has been so much improvement on how homeschooling is done through its century long history. From the crude and very simple methods and materials, new ones that are more sophisticated and complex have become available. It completely fills up the role of institutional learning.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">Parents choose homeschooling for many different reasons. The artificial world of school and the natural world of homeschooling. As I try to bring them the freedom of the homeschooling experience, within the confines of their school, they bemoan the drudgery of their regular classroom instruction. Each time I hear them complain about being forced to waste time on "busy work" I am reminded that our homeschooling life gives me very little worry these days. It is the schools in which I work that seem to be on the wrong path. My students confirm that schools are entirely out of step with what the lives of children are really about. All children deserved to experience the magic of Egypt and none deserved having that magic stolen from them by lesson plans, text books and prying questions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">My life has been lived in two worlds. Of course, I know that hindsight has lots to do with how I feel now. It is for this reason that I enjoy sharing our story. Our children have never been to school and therefore know more about what it means to be homeschooled than we do." Like most parents who make the decision to homeschool, our decision was made with great care. All of this foraging in the realm of homeschooling made us feel we could do it. We also knew that Wisconsin was in the process of developing new homeschooling laws, which meant that there would be the possibility of having a voice in the process.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">All of these events, when considered together, seemed to be an open invitation to take the risk and try a year of homeschooling. In the initial stages of our homeschooling life, the most serious concern we had was limited to one important issue: Finding support, in our new community, for our chosen educational path. When my husband Phil first mentioned the idea of homeschooling our three children, I tried to pretend I hadn't heard him. What I soon learned was that God uses each parent's strengths to provide a unique environment for the family, and they are led into many new and broadening experiences. I wondered if I could keep homeschooling once we reached high school. I wanted my children to be in a healthy atmosphere, spiritually and emotionally, but could I really prepare them for college and a future career? Certain curricula lend themselves to multilevel teaching.</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">You can design your program so that older children work independently in the morning while you work individually with younger children, and then while younger children take naps in the afternoon, you can have one-on-one time with older students. Even though I was an experienced classroom teacher, I had seen a number of successful homeschool moms and had thought, "But I don't have their placid temperament or their particular strengths." Much to our delight, our two sons have married and both are committed to teaching their own children at home. I remember when we started homeschooling in 1985. If you feel God is calling you to continue homeschooling during the high school years, let me encourage you-you can do it, with his help. Though we've had the typical ups and downs of homeschooling life, I can now look back on the results of my daily efforts, and have confidence that he's prepared them for whatever the future holds. My parents decided to homeschool me because I had speech problems, and they didn't want to expose me to the teasing of school children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">Homeschooled students don't have to take time to change classes or travel to and from a school, so they can proceed at their own pace. Many homeschooled teens supplement their education with community college classes, taking over the direction of their education much earlier than other kids their age. Homeschool graduates closely parallel their public school counterparts&#65533;about two-thirds go on to post-secondary education, and one-third directly into the job market. Homeschool students who have utilized community colleges for foreign language, lab science, or higher mathematics courses discover as an added bonus that these course credits make it easier to enroll in four-year colleges after high school graduation. I am a mom of two sensational daughters ages 11 and 9. I have homeschooled them all their schooling years so far. We have evolved so much and continue to when needed.</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">My Favorite Sources for Support and Resources We are involved in both local and state homeschool support groups. Usually, local groups ask for new members to attend at least one activity per month for the first two months. They encourage all new members to get actively involved from the beginning, so new members are welcome to arrange activities, classes and outings. I, of course, plan something that my girls will enjoy as every other parent does for their own children, that way there is something for every age. So there is a fruitful of activities to choose from. New Mexico is an Easy State to Homeschool In</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">New Mexico is probably the easiest state to homeschool in. Every year it seems that groups and events catering to homeschoolers grow. To fulfill the basic legal requirements for NM, you must have at least a high school diploma or its equivalent. You must also notify the state superintendent of intent to homeschool within 30 days of the establishment of the homeschool and by April 1st of each year. There is a website and simple form to submit this. I Love the Flexibility of Homeschooling I definitely love the flexibility of homeschooling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">I start my day of school between 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. My daughters have a spreadsheet of what they need to do every day in Time4Learning (for an example: two lesson activities in math, two in social studies, etc.) This way, I don't have to be right there in order for them to start school. They work well independently, but I will sit down beside them on subjects I know they need extra help with. We have two computers in the household so they do work simultaneously. With my girls so close in age, we usually have them do science projects together. My husband or I will take them to the library to do their research. Their school day ends usually around lunch time. Both girls are in extracurriculars with other homeschoolers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="220">Choosing Homeschool Curriculum Time4Learning's experience shows that there is no single, best homeschool material. Rather than feeling torn between homeschool resources, parents should select a diverse blend of materials and activities. Our online learning materials are especially well-suited to children who are visual or kinesthetic learners. These children can take advantage of Time4Learning's interactive, multi-media materials. Children like using the computer to learn. It's a convenient, interactive homeschool resource that provides a welcome change each day to paper-and-pencil workbooks and textbook-based lessons.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">Parents like that it tracks progress and helps children advance by clearly presenting and reinforcing each lesson. Time4Learning's self-paced, modularized lesson plans allow you to move forward and back through the materials whenever you want. You can skip lessons that teach concepts your child has already mastered and repeat those he or she has not. The choice is yours. With Time4Learning, you are always in control. Time4Learning is proven effective with homeschoolers, has a low monthly price, is easy-to-use , and provides a money-back guarantee so you can make sure that it works for your children!

Homeschool Veterans Declare "You Can Stop Worrying," An Ebook. Eighteen homeschool veterans from all walks of life share their experiences - their challenges, fears, trials and triumphs. Its companion book, Getting Started on Home Learning also by Rebecca Rupp, includes an inspiring discussion of her own experience of homeschooling three sons.

Holt was an educational and social critic, and a pioneering homeschooling advocate. Insights on the challenges and joys of homeschooling special-needs children with challenges ranging from autism or ADD to other learning disabilities or who simply march to the beat of a different drummer.

Many factors can affect the cost, including what kinds of materials and resources you use, how many children you have, and whether someone in your family will give up paid employment in order to homeschool.</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">If you decide to buy a packaged curriculum for five children, you could be looking at several thousand dollars over that same year. Homeschooling is an increasingly popular educational alternative in which children learn outside of conventional schools under the general supervision of their parents. For others, homeschooling is simply the way they live their lives - children and adults living and learning together in a seamlessness that would challenge an observer to determine which was 'home' and which was 'school'. A wise man once said, "We can teach our children to have courage, faith and endurance; they can teach us to laugh, to sing, to love." Many families like the flexibility homeschooling provides both parents and children. Children can learn about things they are interested in and at a time in their lives when they are ready to learn. Children can learn about the 'real world' by being part of it - no artificial settings to 'provide exposure".</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">Children can receive a superior education attuned specifically to their own needs, learning styles, personalities, and interests - at far less cost than that of a private or public school. Some parents find their children's learning differences are not dealt with effectively at school and decide that homeschooling may be more suitable for their children's' needs and learning style. Parents do not lightly make the decision to homeschool their children. But for homeschooling parents, the task of helping their children learn is seldom a burden. Children who are given the opportunity to follow their own interests, to dig deeply into topics that interest them, to have some say in how they learn, become eager and effective learners. Just as they help their children to learn to walk and talk by providing models ands guidance, parents of homeschooled children help their older children by proving tools and resources. Homeschooling children may be interested in a subject or involved in an activity that their parents don't know much about and that's fine - there's a world of resources available.</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">Some families homeschool some of their children but not others.

Their homeschool style is eclectic with a great love of living history books. She homeschools five children from preschool to middle school. At five, our daughter was eligible to join the youngest of Girl Scouts, the Daisies, but there were no leaders for the newly-formed troop of twelve. Rather than lose the opportunity for creating new friendships and being part of a group, I took on the role of leader and enlisted a friend to help out. We are now going into our fourth year of scouting together and it has proven to be a great opportunity for all of the girls to learn from each other. Within our small troop we have two homeschoolers, a few who attend a parochial school, and the balance are from two different public schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">I remember once talking to a homeschooling friend who lived three states away near a large city. It seemed there were more opportunities than she could possibly have time for in a week &#65533; museums, fully-equipped libraries, resource-filled bookstores and a sizable, networking homeschooling group. After wallowing in despair about what we didn&#65533;t have available here, I took stock and began thinking creatively. Even though it meant driving an hour-and-a-half, we tagged along with our homeschool group on a farm tour. At times I had to rely on another mom to keep my daughter on the &#65533;people side&#65533; of the animal pens while I nursed my son, but it was worth every minute. The two-step tour began with free time for the children to explore all the facets of agriculture in rooms that were set up to look like a roadside stand, a grocery store, a bank, a feed store, a veterinary&#65533;s office, and an ice cream shop. This area was also a nursery of sorts with a few bantam chicks peeping under the warmth of an incubator and a tank of fingerling trout.</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">Two kids of the goat variety were free to roam about causing much giggling by our kids, as they climbed to places they shouldn&#65533;t be and kicked about. Part two of the tour took us through the stalls and pens of the facilities, exposing the children to the enormous variety of animal life on a farm. Multi-colored chickens scratched about; a fat hog eyed us with little interest; a doe-eyed Jersey cow chewed her cud; horses twitched away an occasional fly; but the highlight was the crop of lambs in a large pen with their mothers. One lamb on bent knees suckling its mother, and a stub of a tail twitching is sweet -- multiplied by dozens is all the more so. This visit got me thinking. Granted this farm we visited was maintained as a &#65533;school&#65533; group destination but why not look for this opportunity closer to home? And for that matter, why limit ourselves to the few towns in our area?</paragraph><paragraph parID="234">I soon discovered that there were many opportunities and a number were close by. A lumber mill was more than happy to offer tours of its facilities, providing another connection to real life and uncovering -- for some at least -- the source of the support in the walls in our homes. As we explored the post office, library and newspaper offices, we realized we were not only learning about how our mail gets from our town to Uncle John and Aunt Mary in Colorado or how we can find a book on Space or how the comics get from the computer onto the paper, but we were also learning about the people behind the letters, books and comic strips. We then began to look even closer to home by tapping into the parents in our group who were less involved in the day-to-day homeschooling. Bringing them into the fold accomplished two objectives: The kids were exposed to new possibilities for career dreams and those less-involved parents got a chance to see their children learning among their homeschooling peers. One dad, an internist specializing in cardiology, led the full group of homeschoolers throughout the remodeled emergency center of the local hospital, giving everyone a chance to swing her legs from a gurney or feel her arm tighten as she had her blood pressure checked. From there, the doctor took the oldest of our group (ten and up) to his office where, among other cardiology equipment, the discussions might go deeper.</paragraph><paragraph parID="235">From a more down-to-earth outlook and certainly a more unique profession, our group found themselves digging test pits using a screw auger under the direction of a soils scientist among us, my husband. They learned what a soils scientist studies in school, yes, soil types, but also chemistry, physics and biology. They learned to match the soil colors to a waterproof hand-held flipchart to identify the soils and to rub the soil between their fingers to determine the amount of sand, silt and clay. They discovered that, armed with this knowledge, the soils scientist can determine if a particular site will support a septic system and therefore be a viable building site. Over time, our concerns involving friends for our children evaporated as more and more of our friends decided that homeschooling might work for their families too. My daughter and son gained homeschooling peers and our support group gained parents with new talents and energy to share. We still don&#65533;t have immediate access to year-round museums but as our children have gotten a little older and more travel savvy we&#65533;re a little less reluctant to drive farther afield.</paragraph><paragraph parID="236">Traveling with other children makes the drive more appealing to my kids, especially when we go in the fifteen-passenger van that one homeschooling mom uses for her canoe-guiding business. Although it doesn&#65533;t replicate the routine that some public schooled friends are privy to, it seems to satisfy our children&#65533;s questions as to what riding a school bus is like. Long, wide seats are shared, lunches are consumed and silly songs are sung over and over again. Not a bad way to travel and not a bad way to learn.

Discover practical tips to achieve unity and cooperation in your home from an experienced mom of 17 homeschooled students, seven school-aged children at a time! If you have more than one child, you likely have a right-brained learner in your midst. Auditory learning doesn't come as naturally to these wonderful children as it does to their left-brained siblings. Rather, they store information in their long-term memory by using pictures, color, story or emotion attached to the facts they need to learn. Myth #2 Homeschooled children are isolated and do not learn how to socialize with others. Most families I interviewed are very active outside the home and make opportunities to practice social skills.</paragraph><paragraph parID="239">Homeschool parents have more natural opportunities to coach their children on social skills, and homeschooled children have more opportunities to relate to people of all ages, rather than being isolated with twenty-five people their age in a classroom.Children on the autistic spectrum, for example, may find a small homeschooled physical education class easier to adapt to than a public school class.A child with learning disabilities may do better in a homeschool math class with five children, than a private school's class of fifteen.Organizing social activities takes time, and some families some places do struggle to avoid isolation.But enrolling a student in public school does not guarantee good social skills, a good social life, or good friends, either.As one mother said of her autistic children's experiences, "They don't really get social skills at school, and what they do get, I find to be negative."</paragraph></documents>
