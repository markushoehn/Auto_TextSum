    <paragraph parID="0">Things are going beautifully until your little guest grabs a toy from your daughter and runs off with it. Do you let it go or swoop in to restore the toy to your daughter? As tempting as it may be to discipline the other child, there could be consequences - such as your neighbor asking you to mind your own business. At worst, the kids could witness two grown adults defending their young, and the result might be ugly. The basic rule of thumb is: Don't do it. Most parents agree, it's okay if the situation calls for immediate action - in the case of a physical fight, for example. It may also be okay if you've been given permission from the child's parent or caregiver to step in.</paragraph><paragraph parID="1">The boys are playing with blocks when they start to argue about who has more. Suddenly, your young guest begins flinging blocks across the room, and then pushes your son to the ground. You might kneel at the boys' level and say, "I see you're angry because you don't have an equal number of blocks, but throwing and pushing won't help. What do you think you can do so it's fairer?" Without reprimanding anyone, you've expressed your concerns and offered direction. Even at this young age, you may be surprised at the solutions kids come up with. They're getting along fine until the six-year-old from across the street comes over and starts whispering with the neighbor.</paragraph><paragraph parID="2">Soon the other two girls run off, giggling. It would be normal to want to run across the street, admonish the girls for being mean to your daughter, and talk to them about empathy and respect. If this is the first time it's happened, focus on your own child by acknowledging her feelings. You could say, "You were playing with Leila and having such a great time. It must have really hurt that Sarah came and took her away from you." Your daughter will likely nod as tears run down her cheeks; it's amazing what five minutes of acknowledging feelings and cuddling can do to make things all right. Once she's more composed, you might ask her, "What could you do differently next time something like this happens?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="3">It would be great if she came up with the idea of standing up for herself rather than running inside, for example, or being able to tell her friend how she felt. If this friendship triangle becomes an ongoing problem for your daughter, it would be appropriate to approach the other girls' parents to share your concern. Be cautious, though, or they might feel you're telling them how to handle their kids, rather than asking for their support in resolving the issue. You see one of his friends take a $20 bill from the counter - you must have forgotten to put it back in your wallet. You could take your young guest aside and talk to him about what you saw, but he'd probably try to save face by lying about his actions - and you can't very well insist on searching his pockets. Instead, you might choose to wait until the party is over, and then call his parents. Let them know you didn't feel it was your place to say anything to their son at the party, but you felt they should know what happened.</paragraph><paragraph parID="4">Try to imagine how you might feel if you were on the receiving end of the call and that will help you express your concerns in a supportive, non-adversarial way. Most parents will take this seriously and appreciate that you did not take the matter into your own hands. They'll likely have their son return the money and apologize for taking it. You're at the community pool with your six- and eight-year-old kids. They're splashing away while you keep an eye on them. You notice that two older boys are getting rough as they chase each other close to your children, who aren't such good swimmers. What do you do?</paragraph><paragraph parID="5">In this situation, safety is the priority. You could physically position yourself between the big kids and your children, or say, "Let's move to another part of the pool where you'll be safer." Since it's unlikely that you'll spot the boys' parents or caregivers quickly in a crowded pool, you may need to intervene if the rough play continues. In a case like this, you might say something like, "Hey, guys, can you move the game somewhere else? In general, when it comes to friends and relatives with whom you spend a lot of family time, it's good to share your beliefs about discipline do's and don'ts and, together, come up with an approach both sides can live with. And if you really trust and respect the way someone disciplines her own children, you may even give her permission to discipline your kids when you're right there in the room. It's as though someone is saying, "I'm stepping in because you're not doing a very good job of dealing with this."</paragraph><paragraph parID="6">There are ways to handle this that don't involve teeth and claws. Then your child throws sand and it gets in his buddy's eyes. He starts to cry and his mom runs over to console him. You head over, too, but before you can say anything, your neighbor has told your child to "keep the sand in the box and play nicely." Instead of bottling up your resentment, you could speak up and tell her you were just about to talk to your son about his behavior. Let her know with a smile that you're on the case next time something comes up - and that you'll give her the same space with her child. Although you appreciate her time, and love that the kids feel connected to her, you don't appreciate her contradicting you on discipline: When you give them a time-out, she takes their side and asks you to give them a second chance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="7">Still, you do need to address it. Talk to your spouse about what you have in mind and then either together, or on your own, find a moment to discuss it with your mother-in-law. You might say, "When you step in and take the kids' side, I feel as though my authority is being questioned. And I think it's confusing for the kids. If you feel I'm not being fair with them, I'd prefer to talk about it privately with you. Can we try that?" For me, discipline with a two-year-old mainly consists of teaching him that I mean what I say, especially when it comes to hurting others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="8">Earlier this week I read a fascinating piece about children and discipline, at the blog Like Mother, Like Daughter. We thought she was too young for real discipline, so we tried training her instead: when she hit, we'd hold her arms by her sides and count down from ten. The piece's attention-grabbing title is " Six-to-eleven year olds need less patience from you ," but at heart it's about how to raise children to practice true charity, defined by the author ("Mom" blogger Leila) as "simply treating people with that very love you would like to receive." Only you know, for sure, when the right time will present itself to have "the talk" with your kids. But, chances are, if you're the parent of a tween, your kid may already be experiencing romantic drama in his or her own world. Did you know that one out of six 8 -11 year olds sees other students "kissing or making out" and 45% want more information on how to know when they are ready for a boyfriend or girlfriend 1 ? Here's what I told my 10-year-old daughter about kissing, romance, and "dating" &amp;gt;</paragraph><paragraph parID="9">"Mom, Teagan and Royce kissed on the lips behind a tree on the playground today." A few months ago my 10-year-old daughter reported this to me as I tucked her into bed. I heard the angst behind the simple statement and noticed her furrowed brow. And although I was tired, and wanted nothing more than to curl up with a good book under my own blankets, I scooted her over and crawled into bed with her. "Hmmm....tell me more," I probed a little deeper. Cue the flood gates: Jack likes Julia; Colton and Maggie are going together; Judy once kissed Jake in the hall for 10 seconds; Simon says my daughter would be perfect for Marcus (I didn't ask perfect for what), and so on and so forth. It turns out there is A LOT of fourth grade drama in her world.</paragraph><paragraph parID="10">People outside this group have started teasing her, she says, about how much she and Corey like each other. But mostly right now she wishes people would leave her alone about it. I listened more than I talked that night, a practice I generally find to be among the best, but did offer her three bits of wisdom gleaned from my own years of drama, friendship, parenting, and youth work: If you feel uncomfortable about something you see or something someone tells you, it's always a good idea to talk to an adult you trust (together we decided to report the playground kissing, without naming names, to the principal). Ten is not at all too young to have romantic feelings for someone, but it is very young to have exclusive relationships that leave out other friends. Physical touch is an important way we express our close feelings for others. Things like holding hands, sitting close together, and hugging are all ways we can show and feel love and caring and trust.</paragraph><paragraph parID="11">And these things feel good. Some touch is much more personal and therefore makes our feelings about it more complicated and confusing. It's important that we save these most personal kinds of touch, like kissing, for people we trust and love very much. _______________________________________________________________________________________________ 1. Open communication with your child about what goes on at school and in their world is the key to raising a responsible, caring teen. Listening, without judegment is also very important. Positive discipline helps a child develop a conscience guided by his own internal discipline and compassion for others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="12">Discipline that is empathetic, loving, and respectful strengthens the connection between parent and child. Rather than reacting to behavior, discover the needs leading to the behavior. Communicate and craft solutions together while keeping everyone's dignity intact. Toddlers and preschoolers require finesse to gain their cooperation, because they have not yet reached the age at which they can see and understand the whole picture, so simply explaining what you want doesn't always work.Robert Scotellaro is quoted in The Funny Side of Parenthood as saying, "Reasoning with a two-year-old is about as productive as changing seats on the Titanic." The key is to respond with appropriate discipline. Discipline can mean many things, but in this context, it means instruction or teaching (Latin noun disciplina: knowledge or instruction). Discipline can be loving, kind and firm, keeping intact the dignity and respect of both parent and child, and should not be confused with hurt or punishment.</paragraph><paragraph parID="13">Teaching a baby starts at birth. A parent who picks up a crying baby is teaching the baby that its distress matters to the parent, and that the baby can trust that the caring parent will be there to comfort it and make the world right. Tantrums tend to occur when a child is hungry, tired or already upset... It's important to say yes to a child whenever possible... Teach children ever-increasing possibilities, not ever-decreasing ones. But my son's reaction did remind me that it must be really disheartening for kids to hear the constant barrage of no's and directives from parents-don't touch that; sit down; drink your milk; do up your coat; use your manners; no...you can't do that; ask for help; no...not right now. When I tried to have my 6-year old leave a public swimming pool, she resisted to the point of almost making a scene. Not wanting to create a disturbance, as embarrassed as I was I resorted to having the lifeguard assist in my endeavors.</paragraph><paragraph parID="14">If I were in that situation, I would ask my daughter, " Do you want to go swimming in the future?" This question would prompt her to reflect and make a choice for her long-term best interests. Another approach could be-since it was past her time to leave the pool-saying to her, "The clock is running." Explain that the phrase means she is now using up your time and will be accountable for it later. The next day let her know that she used 10 minutes of your time at the pool the day before and now it's her turn to wait on you. Give her two choices of assignments -preferably distasteful ones. The key to remember is that SHE does the choosing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="15">Or have her suggest an activity that will assist her to not repeat the behavior. Either way, having her choose is the prime difference between elicitation and imposition . When she asks you a question, and you enter into a discussion based on her question, she is controlling the conversation. I immediately thought of you and wondered how you would have handled this discipline situation. Any suggestions? Children mature when they begin to realize that other people's interests are also involved in their decisions. Having a youngster become aware of this is one of the most important charges a parent has.</paragraph><paragraph parID="16">Don't tell her what that means. So mething elicited is owned by the person . Something imposed promotes victimhood thinking because it generates a feeling of lack of control. This feeling often results in blaming the person who imposed the punishment. Finally, here is very simple technique to keep in mind-one we have experienced but may not have consciously thought about: THE PERSON WHO ASKS THE QUESTION CONTROLS THE CONVERSATION. Pull out of this by answering with your own question . More information about how to handle situations like this one is explained in the parenting book .</paragraph><paragraph parID="17">Five- and 6-year-olds get far more spankings than 7- and 8-year-olds, or 9- and 10-year-olds. Dennis: At this time, you need to be a good student of your child and evaluate other forms of discipline that will work. For example, we have a chore box--a highly productive form of discipline--for the kid who has tried to get away with doing as little as possible. We have the child open the box, close her eyes, reach in, and draw one out. When our kids started griping and complaining frequently we found a jar and put some coins in it. Each time a child complained a coin was taken out of the jar. We then informed our children that they could keep whatever was left in the jar at the end of 30 days, but if they went through all the coins in the jar, we would start taking from each child's allowance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="18">Thus, the jar is both a reward and a penalty. This process never ends with children, but you can drive these points home with punishments for negative behavior and rewards for positive behavior. Unfortunately, it's very common for the same issues to crop up again when the child is 6-9 years old. There's a lot of repetition in the discipline process in the preadolescent years. Spanking gradually decreases during this older stage. The outside of the box says, "For those to care enough to do the very least." Inside the box are 25-30 of the most unpleasant chores Barbara does around the house.</paragraph><paragraph parID="19">As children transition from grade school into junior high and high school, spanking becomes obsolete and you move to grounding-removing the child's opportunities and privileges. What we do do is time-outs, typically for hitting (usually me), throwing things, or blatant disobedience (it's fairly easy to tell the difference between her curiosity and defiance). When one of these things happens, I will tell her it's time for a time-out, and escort her to either a corner in the room, or to a chair (we don't have a specific time-out place). She will then sit there for a couple minutes (I'm not strict on timing), and then I will talk to her about the time-out. I'll hold her hands, get on her level and ask her to look me in the eye. I'll then explain why she had the time-out, and ask her if she's ready to do (or not do) that specific action any more. Then I will ask her if I can give her a hug, and I'll tell her that I love her.</paragraph><paragraph parID="20">The thing is, lately she has started putting herself in time-out. Meaning, she'll throw something, for example, look at me and say, "time-out", then go to the corner and sit down. I'm just going to state for the record that I'm against spanking, too (although that doesn't mean that I haven't felt the urge to do it!) As I've said previously , I don't think time-outs are particularly good as punishment or deterrent to bad behavior. They just don't have much long-term bite, and what's happening with your daughter ends up happening an awful lot: The kid realizes the only thing that's going to happen is a time-out, which is nothing, so they do the bad thing, sit through the time out, and go on their merry toddler way. I use time-outs mainly as a physical or temporal separator to just stop the immediate situation. They are interested in absolutely everything under the sun, so it would be virtually impossible to find a place to put them for a time-out that would be a real deterrent to negative behavior.</paragraph><paragraph parID="21">And a 2-3-minute time-out really isn't anything, but you can't do a longer one because a kid that young doesn't have the attention span. I think they also learn that the looking-in-the-eye and apologizing and hugs is part of the drill, so it ceases to have much meaning in that context anymore. (Which is not to say that some kids aren't extremely sensitive and responsive to any mode of correction, so time-outs probably work for them because they're so embarrassed to be caught in bad behavior anyway.) I think, sad as it is to say, that there's no one method of discipline that's going to work with a 2-year-old. You're going to have to turn into a detective to try to figure out either why she's doing what she's doing (and how you can stop it) or what you can do to avoid or redirect her behavior even if you don't know why she's doing it (and there may not be a reason, because, well, she's 2). One highly effective way to deal with this kind of violent outburst is to recognize that it's from the frustration and allow the kid to have those feelings. (I'm actually just about to start a new book by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka [the Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles author] about how sleep deprivation is a leading cause of misbehavior even in older kids.</paragraph><paragraph parID="22">The only thing you can really do about this is to decide what your limits are and then stand firm. If you don't care about something, don't set up an artificial boundary just to back down later. But the things that you do care about, just stand firm on them, and be as calm as possible. You may need to redirect your child physically (I had to do this all the time with my older one--I'd have to physically move him from the situation, or put my hands on his and give the toy back, or put my hands on his and brush his teeth for him while he held the toothbrush--and sometimes still do when he gets very tired) or just sit down with your kid and hug her so she calms down, or just let her rage until the fit is over. You may have to physically restrain her from doing something, or take something away from her, or just stand between her and the thing. The most important part of this is to remain unemotional about it. The things you describe your daughter doing sound like they are probably in the category of frustration or just not being able to deal with emotions that are way more complex than her speech is right now.</paragraph><paragraph parID="23">So I'm betting that you'll have luck with trying to help her channel her frustrated and angry feelings into something else (increased physical activity and/or hitting a special pillow or stuffed animal) or logical consequences (she runs away from you so she has to ride in the stroller instead of walking, or she yanks the cat's fur so she can't go into the room with the cat for the rest of the evening, for example) or even just continuing with everyone's perennial favorite--distraction. It's a really tough age, because they're so much more advanced than they can express, and they are just nonstop. So try to get enough sleep, pick your battles (which it sounds like you do), and try to ferret out what is making her do the misbehavior (which shouldn't be too hard since it sounds like you know exactly what makes her tick) and react specifically, swiftly, and pleasantly. The practical tips are more useful for kids aged 3 and up, but the ideas behind how to look at kids' moods and misbehavior can reduce your stress level with a kid at basically any age (I first read it when my older son was around 15-16 months, and it helped me even then). One that I need and when she doesn't spend 25 minutes fighting a 4 minute break, one that helps. Instead of counting and she has to stop by the time you get to three, try having her count with you to 5 or 10 or something and then together you move onto the next thing? 1...2...") It gives her some control of the counting, and helps her save face and not be backed into a corner so she either has to give up or keep misbehaving.</paragraph><paragraph parID="24">He'd do something he knew was wrong -- like hit the dog -- and then go put himself into a time out. First, we made time outs a bit more punitive (which I know not everyone would agree with, but it worked for us). Rather than having him sit on a chair nearby where we were, we sent him up to his room, told him to close the door, and stay there for a minute or two. Now, we only did/do this for SERIOUS things, like hitting or biting, but it was quite effective as he really hated being removed from the family and sent to be by himself. My son has been taught self-respect, respect for others, discipline, teamwork, how to work hard to obtain a goal, how good it feels to obtain that goal, how important it is NOT to fight and that he should never brag about his martial arts training or even mention it at school except to "trusted" friends. They are very supportive of girls in the sport and the head of the Berkeley school actually said that once the girls get past the beginning level, they are usually more serious about the sport than the boys. My daughter started Kuk Sool Won training at age 9 and continues to take classes now that she's a first degree black belt.</paragraph><paragraph parID="25">In addition to teaching children physical self defense, owner and head instructor and fifth degree black belt Thomas Brewer provides instruction on how to maintain mental clarity, integrity, self discipline, loyalty, and respect, and is a very positive role model for all students. He's expert at tailoring the instruction to the child's needs and abilities. He's given my skinny, timid son strength and self-assuredness that I never thought he'd possess, and boosted my shy daughter's confidence, and helped her see herself as strong, graceful, and in control of her body. My roly-poly kindergartener has developed much more body awareness and coordination. Stephan's other strength is building children's self-control, responsibility, and social skills. Unlike some martial arts classes my children have taken, there's neither bored waiting around nor frenetic activity and chaos. Stephan has a gift for getting all the kids to play by the rules.</paragraph><paragraph parID="26">They get a really good workout, a consistent and healthy philosophy, and systematically build their skills. I highly recommend Stephan Goyne, who teaches jiu-jitsu to my two boys (5 and 12) and one of my daughters (9). Plus, he is an effective teacher: as my 12-year-old son put it this morning, Stephan is a good teacher because he always gives a clear description of the purpose of the move and its mechanics, he demonstrates it multiple times, and doesn't move on until all the children have started to get the hang of it. And, my son adds, he doesn't let one or two children misbehave and spoil the class for everyone else. Stephan teaches two classes on Saturday for kids: 10:30-11 for the youngest children, and 11-12 for bigger children. Archives were a little old on this...Looking for a martial arts class for a 4 year old in Alameda (or real close) that would be good for motor skills, balance and discipline. Instead find out if she'd like a dance or tumbling class.</paragraph><paragraph parID="27">Those will give her strength, balance, and coordination. One of my daughters started martial arts when she was 5; the other when she was 8. Set up your own mini-practice sessions at home, and do the forms and techniques with them. Much emphasis is placed on positive encouragement, mutual respect, and discipline; which makes punishment virtually unnecessary. I am looking for a karate class for my shy 7 year old to learn self defense and develop confidence. I have been studying and teaching martial arts for over 40 years. Both daughters had to use their martial arts on their trips to and from Berkeley's public schools.</paragraph><paragraph parID="28">My son can be a very intense child and he gets tremendous pleasure and sense of self out the lessons. They are a balance of serious martial arts, philosophy, self-discipline and repsect for others. Hi - I sent my kids to Martial Arts of America when they were quite small (I think the twins were in kindergarten and my son was in third grade). It was a great program - really about character, discipline, respect for parents and teachers. It has all the martial art discipline and structure, but the emphasis is on self-defense, not kicking and/or punching. I am a former Oakland elementary and middle school teacher, I can tell you that many children instinctively want to PUNCH or KICK when they get angry. After over three years, my kids (now 8 and 11) still look forward to every one of the 5 (yes, five) classes they go to over three days each week at Hoa Sen dojo for Coung Nhu.</paragraph><paragraph parID="29">Mr. Brewer is the owner and instructor. The kids love him and learn a lot - martial arts and discipline. My son started martial arts at age 7 and is now a black belt at age 14 (he actually earned it at 13) and continues to attend the black belt sessions. Sir stresses values, discipline and respect (among other things) and has been a great instructor. John Burns is the head instructor and offers classes for kids as young as 4-5, 6 &amp;amp; up are in the kids class, there are teen &amp;amp; adult classes. My daughter can be challenge to keep still and quiet so I also need a teacher with a magical manner or who understands children with extra personality. My 11 year old daughter started taekwondo when she was 9.</paragraph><paragraph parID="30">She watched the classes for several months before she started (my son, 7 at the time, was going twice a week) and it has been positive for both kids. They are physically and mentally stronger for it. They attend Pitts Martial Arts Academy on Lakeshore Ave. Mr Pitts is a phenomenal teacher and can inspire all kinds of kids at all ages and at all levels. He manages to combine high expectations, kindness and humor. He cares how well the kids are doing in school, what they've eaten for breakfast and that they understand what it means to be a ''good'' person in society. Each class is started with a few minutes of meditation. The kids are encouraged to help/support each other and have memorized sayings like ''the goal of success will lead to success.''</paragraph><paragraph parID="31">http://www.albanykarateforkids.com Shirley, proud mama of an orange belt I HIGHLY recommend DragonFly Karate in Berkeley. My son started when he was 5 1/2 and he loves it. The instructor is awesome and classes are both one on one and small group. This is serious martial arts (they progress through the colored belts) balanced with philosophy, discipline and good behavior skills. Sir stresses values, discipline and respect (among other things) and has been a great instructor over the past 6+ years. My 5- yo son is very aggressive, both physically and verbally. He's prone to frequent meltdowns, rage attacks, verbal lashing-out, etc.</paragraph><paragraph parID="32">We are working with various mental health professionals to diagnose and treat him. Additionally, though, I think the right martial arts program may be beneficial for him. I'm looking for something that will help him direct and channel his aggression/physical energy/anger in a positive way and, hopefully ultimately teach him self-discipline and to respect himself and others. My worry is that the wrong program may make him more aggressive, so I'm mostly concerned with the philosophy and approach of the teacher rather than the actual style of martial art. It would be great if the teacher could be a positive role model and mentor to my son. I'd like my two boys (ages 6 and 9) and myself (a 40-ish y.o. woman) to learn a form of martial arts, mainly for self-defense. Each week has a different focus (coordination was this week, then there are things like memory, self control, discipline, focus, etc.).</paragraph><paragraph parID="33">I would recommend this dojo, as the sensei really seems to help kids channel their energy and learn discipline, but without being harsh. I have seen kids practice at other dojos and learn to be violent, but here the focus is on self defense and self discipline. I've seen other families join and stay with it for a long time, and really gain a lot from the experience. You can always refuse to give them and, at least in this case, it would probably be accepted. Fran Re: Class for 5-year-old daughter to help with balance (Nov 1999) Martial Arts Schools - If you just want recreation, try the YMCA or the after school programs but, if you want serious martial arts and have a budget for it, you can't do better than West Wind Karate. Your child will learn all the physical elements as well as respect, anatomy, endurance, patience, etc. Re: Class for 5-year-old daughter to help with balance (Nov 1999) I also would like to recommend West Wind Karate school on San Pablo.</paragraph><paragraph parID="34">My 6 years old daughter started karate classes there in June, and by far is very happy. The additional feature which I really like is that they have group classes three times a week, and you can attend any (or all) of them at your convenience. Though I am personally convinced that a calm, rational conversation about an issue should always trump any kind of 'punishment', I do also believe that discipline is necessary at times. Putting a kid in time out because you don't want to deal with them is one thing, not discipline, but irresponsible parenting. Putting a kid in time out because the offense warrants a time out will give the child the opportunity to calm him or herself, hopefully think about what happened and what went wrong. Learning consequences and being held responsible for behavior is important. Children need to learn to deal with feeling remorse and - yes - being unhappy for a while.</paragraph><paragraph parID="35">You aren't torturing your child. You CAN have a compassionate, happy relationship with your kids without being a doormat. Here's another great article about why time-outs are harmful: http://rootparenting.org/child-timeouts-can-be-harmful/ And if you REALLY want your parenting world rocked, read some Alfie Kohn, specifically Unconditional Parenting. http://www.alfiekohn.org/index.php The Walt Disney Company supports Babble as a platform dedicated to honest, engaged, informed, intelligent and open conversation about parenting. I don't think time outs are bad, the problem is that I think a 7 year old is a little old to be given time outs. I know if it had been me and my 10 year old in that situation, he would have then proceeded to argue with me and make me even madder, just for the hell of it, because my ex-husband use to do the same thing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="36">Your 9 year old son seems to be a little more sensitive and understanding of the fact that he made a mistake as to where my 10 year old would not see it as a mistake, he would see it as an argument starter, because he loves to argue and make everyone around him mad. Seems my dear either your child in particular is a little sensitive and the time out approach is not right for him, or, I suspect this is more likely, you just got played - by a nine year old. Isolation as punishment is a problem. Maybe I'm a wimp, maybe it will bite me in the behind in the long run, but lengthy sob sessions, long separations seem silly to me when a few minutes of explanation could suffice. But from the minute they can really understand what you're saying, coming back together and communicating honestly to make it work seems like such a better, if often challenging, option. If they can get it under control in 10 seconds, that's all the timeout they need. You'd be shocked at how far a little understanding can go.</paragraph><paragraph parID="37">No More Time Outs I try very hard not to give time outs to my children; I think, in general, they're a bad idea. What better way to breed anger and resentment in one's progeny than to stick them somewhere away from you, just at the moment they probably need you the most? But it occurred to me recently, when my 7-year-old lay on his bed in misery, that I never wanted to leave him there too long, at any age. I never wanted him or his brother to have to sit with their bad mood, to build up the sad, lonely, angry thoughts that often occur to one when left to stew alone. Solitude of the not healthy kind is rampant in our society, and it's easy to see why when I myself am tempted to send my children off to distant locales just because it is easier to shun them than to face the difficulty head on. It's vital that we hug one another, even at times of upset and anger - especially at times of upset and anger.</paragraph><paragraph parID="38">Mad as I was, I couldn't leave him there, crying and guilt-ridden. Yes, until your children are the age when you can actually reason with them, perhaps time outs are useful for settling everyone down. There are times when my boys' emotions just get the better of them, and rational conversation and thought are not possible, or they are too willful to admit they were wrong and change their behavior. I ask him what he did wrong, and he either tells me, or if he can't I tell him. I then explain why the behavior was inappropriate (e.g., "hitting hurts Mommy.") and have him agree not to do it again. Once he agrees not to do it again, we can leave time out, but if he won't agree, we have to stay in time out together longer.</paragraph><paragraph parID="39">I know it's hard to acknowledge and validate feelings when children behave badly, but what they need is guidance, not punishment and isolation. You can physically stop the blow, and say, "I see that you're angry." If you can, try to empathize with why they're upset, "You really wanted that toy but so-and-so wouldn't let you have it! You can also give them tools to handle their feelings and their reaction. That being said, giving yourself a time-out and taking some time to calm down so you don't blow up can be healthy. If she does something "wrong" just "The Look" sends her into "Im sorry" and "I love u mommie" mode, lol. I love my son vary much and when he throws a tantrum its SAFER if hes alone in his room then with everyone else.</paragraph><paragraph parID="40">But I use time-outs with my 2 year old for hitting me. I don't isolate him, I just set him in a designated spot until he calms down. I don't leave him alone in the room. It's absolutely necessary for both of us to get a physical break in those situations. I use it as calm down time for my kids or my self. I shouldn't be looked at as punishment but a way to remove the person (child or unruly parent) from the situation. I never reprimanded or grounded my children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="41">There was no need for time outs.

Phelan, Ph.D. How about restrict your eight-year-olds daily calorie intake before a competition, bake her cake as a reward and then pile on the guilt as she eats it? One of the most difficult things for parents to learn is how to discipline their children without taking their children's value or destroying their children's self-esteem. You know many, many parents don't pre-plan their discipline and, as a result of that, they just shoot from the hip and end up damaging the emotions and the identity of their children, wounding their children, making their children feel worthless because of what that son or daughter did. You know we've taught so many parents how to learn to discipline their children and build their self-esteem, to bless and honor their children while they're disciplining. How To Discipline Your Children Without Destroying Their Self Esteem</paragraph><paragraph parID="42">You're so precious to me, but no television tonight." And see, he could discipline his daughter with a smile. While she whined and pounded a little bit more, but he simply applied the consequence of her choice. Now, you know, how many times do you think that that father had to do that? The next week, he came again, dressed as a waiter: "Good evening, miss. For your dining pleasure and enjoyment, we have luscious green peas with television or no peas no television. And you know he didn't have a problem with that in that family every week after that.</paragraph><paragraph parID="43">And he would've had that battle probably almost every single week. And so all of us as parents have a choice, we can learn how to discipline our children with honor and blessing, or we can learn how to discipline our children and take their value, not bless them, damage their identity, and take their self-esteem. You know we've developed many, many resources that explain this in much more detail and you might check out some of these resources on the website www.familyfoundations.com .

Teaching and Displaying Manners: Just an Old-Fashioned Custom?</paragraph><paragraph parID="44">At the conclusion of an evening presentation I gave for parents about "raising resilient children," I invited the audience to ask questions. The questions posed were very relevant to the topic I had addressed and ones that I am accustomed to hearing. They included: "What do I do about sibling rivalry?"

How do I meet their unique needs, including having appropriate expectations for them, without each of them feeling I am not being fair?"

It is not unusual after a Q&amp;A period with the entire audience for parents to come up to speak with me privately. Understandably, some are hesitant to share concerns they have about their children in the presence of neighbors. Others have said to me that they tend to be shy and don't like to speak in public. Still others begin with the statement, "I didn't want to bring this up in front of other people because it might sound silly." In my experience these "silly" questions are not silly at all and are actually on the minds of most parents. Such was the case at a presentation I offered last year.</paragraph><paragraph parID="47">The mother said once again, "I hope this doesn't sound silly, but we've noticed that some of our friends don't seem to ask their children to use polite words like 'please' or 'thank you' or 'excuse me.' As a matter of fact, one of the reasons I'm asking is the other day a friend was over with her five-year-old daughter. When my daughter asked for a glass of juice she didn't use the word 'please.' I said to my daughter in a nice way, 'How do we ask?' My daughter said, 'Mommy, can I have a glass of juice, please.' When our daughters were both out of the room, my friend said something that surprised me." I asked, "What's that?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="48">"She said that she didn't insist her daughter say 'please' or 'thank you' since young kids really don't understand what that means." I wondered, "What do you think?" The father said, "My wife and I discussed it and we both think that it's important for kids to be polite and respectful. But we wondered if we're being overbearing when we remind our kids to say these words. We're also wondering if our kids are just saying those words out of rote and don't understand what the words really mean. Also, we notice that a number of our friends' children rarely say 'please' or 'thank you' or similar words." I responded, "You've brought up some good questions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="49">There are several things I want to say, but I have a question first. You used the word 'overbearing.' I wasn't certain what you meant by that. Have your kids said or done something after you remind them to say 'please' or 'thank you' that makes you feel you've been overbearing?" The mother responded, "Not really, but we find that we have to remind them from time to time. After my friend said that young kids don't understand what these words mean it got us to thinking that perhaps we shouldn't insist they use these words." "From your description, it doesn't sound like you're being overbearing, " I replied.</paragraph><paragraph parID="50">"All kids have to be reminded from time to time to use words that have to do with being polite and respectful. I think we can begin to teach them these words at an early age, certainly by the time most kids are three. However, when we do teach them these words we should explain what the words mean and why it's important to use them. This will lessen the likelihood that our kids just use them in a rote way without appreciating their significance. I think that we can explain even to young children that these words are a way of being nice to other people and that when the words are used, other people will be nicer and more responsive to them." I added, "I wouldn't be worried if at first kids use the words in a rote way. Our responsibility as parents is to explain important ideas so that our children learn to appreciate the relevance of these ideas."</paragraph><paragraph parID="51">Both parents thanked me, saying my comments validated their own beliefs as parents. The article described a practice at the Tobin School in Natick, a suburb of Boston, attended by children pre-kindergarten through second grade. As part of the "curriculum" the school teaches four-year-olds to say hello to their classmates using their names and avoiding any putdowns. Meltz writes, "The lesson in greetings, all seven or so minutes of it, is part of an etiquette curriculum written by head of school Michelle Keating. It's not that she's a throwback to the '60s or wants to turn out robotic children. Rather, she sees manners as fundamental to character development, a way for even very young children to connect with others in positive, respectful ways, and as an antidote to an increasingly rude popular culture." Meltz notes that Jill Rigby, author of Raising Respectful Children in a Disrespectful World , supports the kind of program offered at The Tobin School.</paragraph><paragraph parID="52">Rigby, commenting on children using each other's name, observes, "Even four-year-olds get that there is an inherent need to have people call us by our name." Meltz writes, "Simply knowing each other's names gives children a new response. That not only reduces bullying but also helps children internalize behaviors that make for a more respectful society." Dr. Ron Taffel, a New York City psychologist and friend who has written several books about parenting, views manners as the building blocks of empathy, "an enlightened attempt to familiarize kids with their impact on each other. It's part of the human condition to feel better about oneself if you treat others empathetically and are treated back in kind. That's true even for young children." My colleague Dr. Sam Goldstein and I are just completing a book about raising self-disciplined children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="53">It outlines effective forms of discipline that nurture resilience and respect rather than contempt, resentment, and anger. We emphasize that discipline should always be seen as a teaching process. When we teach manners, we have the opportunity to nurture such important qualities as empathy, caring, respect, and self-discipline - all qualities that Daniel Goleman includes under the concept of emotional intelligence. As parents we must model the behaviors we are trying to teach. If parents yell at each other or at their children, if they regularly use obscene language, if they tell racial, ethnic, or religious jokes, if they talk about others in a demeaning way, then it is difficult for children to learn social skills and respect. Children learn far more from our actions than from what we preach. In addition, as noted in the conversation I had with the parents at my presentation, we must help our children to understand why we should use words like "please" and "thank you" and refrain from uttering words that are hurtful.</paragraph><paragraph parID="54">Conveying this kind of understanding is a process that is not learned in one lesson, but it can begin at an early age. For some, the word "manners" conjures up images of children sitting with their hands folded rigidly in front of them and overly strict parents adhering to the belief that "children should be seen and not heard." Obviously, this is not the way that Ron Taffel, myself, or many others perceive manners. It can be fun to teach children to be respectful, even if they do not totally comprehend our lesson plan at the time. June 21: Discipline for 4-year-old Q: Using the "ticket method" you have described in previous newspaper columns and books, I began my 4-year-old daughter's rehabilitation program this week. When she loses all five of her tickets, she has to spend the rest of the day in her room and go to bed at 7:00 instead of 8:30.</paragraph><paragraph parID="55">One day she lost all of her tickets by mid-morning so I sent her to her room. She came out repeatedly and told me she wasn't going to stay in there. So, I removed all toys from her room and told her that for each time she came out, she would have another night with a 7:00 pm bedtime. Is that the proper thing to do? A: You're not thinking ahead very well, so let me help you. If every time your little rebel comes out of her room, you add another night of early bedtime, it is possible for her to earn a year's worth of early bedtimes in a couple of weeks. Then what do you do?</paragraph><paragraph parID="56">Can you possibly enforce that? The obvious answer is no. I have an 8 year old daughter who is very angry and out of control with verbal abuse. She is currently in therapy to help us get this under some control . What is "positive discipline?" Well, it is an approach to parenting and teaching that is focused on respect, understanding, and finding solutions, rather than on punishing misbehavior. It is based on the principle of mutual respect (an element of all successful relationships) and on the idea that all human beings--and particularly young ones--are looking for what we call "a sense of belonging and significance."</paragraph><paragraph parID="57">When they don't feel that belonging, they usually find a mistaken way of creating it. We call those mistaken ways of belonging "misbehavior." (Some common forms of mistaken behavior are bids for undue attention and power--like yelling and arguing.) How do you "do" positive discipline? If you can decipher the clues, you have a good chance of finding a solution that not only changes her behavior, but deals with her feelings and innermost beliefs. We cover how to do this in all of the Positive Discipline books. She may feel displaced or jealous: she may miss having more time with you.</paragraph><paragraph parID="58">Understanding her beliefs is not, by the way, excusing her behavior, and you're right: both she and your husband will probably do better if they can stop yelling. (And unfortunately, that sort of change almost always begins with us adults!) I understand your husband's desire not to let her behavior get out of control, but engaging in power and/or revenge cycles rarely makes things better. Letting her know she can use words to let you know what's making her unhappy (rather than acting it out through misbehavior) may be a good beginning. I would suggest that the entire family engage in the therapy process in order to look for solutions, rather than just taking your daughter (which is another way of telling her that she's "the problem"). I also highly recommend " Positive Discipline in Your Step family " by Jane Nelsen and Cheryl Erwin (Revised 2nd Edition, Prima, 2000). It addresses many of the tough issues step families face, including divided loyalties and difficult feelings, and you may find more specific answers there.</paragraph><paragraph parID="59">I read an article on positive discipline but I'm not sure what it is or how to do it. Can you please give me examples on this ? She has a stepfather who she has no respect for ( married now for 3 years) She is verbally abusive to him also. I am going crazy and my younger daughter wants me and her to go live in another house without her and the stepfather because of the arguing. I have tried to explain to him not to argue with her that they sound like two 8 year olds going at it. He doesn't want to let up on her he says she will just get worse. can you please help me and my younger daughter?</paragraph><paragraph parID="60">In my experience-- more than a decade of working with families and children as a marriage and family therapist, lecturer, and writer, as well as sixteen years of parenting--it is a daily journey. Perhaps the first question to ask is "what message is your daughter sending you with her behavior?" For starters, I find myself wondering why she "has no respect" for her stepfather. She sounds angry, and if you put yourself in her shoes, a remarriage can alter any child's sense of belonging and significance. It is available in book stores, on our website, or by calling 1-800-456-7770. Hang in there; settling down together takes both time and patience. Because I would discipline them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="61">When she was a three year old and out of her crib, I would take her to her room and tell her she could not leave the room until she was done crying, and then I shut the door. During the years between 5-9, I would tell her to go to her room, shut the door and don't come out until she was ready to behave like a human being. ~What Is This Word...Discipline? One of the ladies who replied to my Mean Mom post asked, "Just wondering did anyone ever discipline any of these kids when they were younger? And now I have a twelve year old daughter who is past throwing herself to the floor in public, but not past screaming, stomping, slamming doors and sobbing into her pillow. The discipline method I used when she was a small baby having a fit was that I would take her to her crib, tell her it wasn't okay to have a fit then lay her down and leave the area. The system was good, it worked--she would lay on her bed sobbing about the inequality of life until she fell asleep, and then she would come to me with a new round of, "But can I just..."</paragraph><paragraph parID="62">When she turned eleven, there was a shift in the program. The primary shift was that she went from just crying to yelling at me. When the yelling began, I took a page from MY mother's book and began quoting the line, "I am not your friend, I am your mother and you better start speaking to me with respect." Now she slams doors and every so often she continues to scream, "You are so unfair--you are so mean--!!" Discipline is a funny word and I guess it means different things to different people. The word always reminds me of spankings and I would rather not think about spankings, though I hear they are a very effective means of getting a point across. I realized that I was giving spankings because I was angry, and slapping them was a release for me.</paragraph><paragraph parID="63">It is when my daughter is inside her room screaming at me that I exercise the discipline that my mother taught me: Rather then going into her room and lining her out for her bad behavior, I walk away so I can no longer hear her, and she wails til she is done and she falls asleep. I plan to continue that program of discipline until she is an adult as I hear consistency in discipline is the key to success. And also because when my daughter is screaming in my face my natural instinct is to slap her, and I gave up slapping years ago. So to answer the original question about discipline: Yes, I think I disciplined my daughter when she was younger. Maybe I didn't discipline my daughter correctly when she was a child, but I hope that I am raising her with enough discipline that when she has a twelve year old daughter herself she will remember the phrase, "I am not your friend, I am your mother and you better start treating me with respect." Also, with 5 girls, I can tell/warn you that girls are much more emotional and argumentative than boys are - I always blame the hormones. In my two earlier columns about discipline I discouraged the use of spanking and I recommended an approach that focused on preventing or minimizing the emergence of misbehavior in our children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="64">We must help them to learn that there are consequences for their behavior. Without experiencing consequences, it is almost impossible for youngsters to become responsible, caring, thoughtful individuals. If we want our children to develop these admirable qualities then we must use consequences that are appropriate, fair, and thoughtful. As a form of education, consequences should not be linked to practices that intimidate, hurt, or embarrass children. Discipline should serve not only to maintain a safe and secure environment in which our children learn the importance of and reason for rules, limits, and consequences, but also to develop self-discipline and self-control. Children must understand that there are consequences for their actions and that these consequences are neither harsh nor arbitrary. Also, when possible, consequences should be discussed with our children in advance so that they can reflect upon the choices they are making.</paragraph><paragraph parID="65">Natural consequences should not be used if they place a child in danger (an obvious example is allowing a young child to ride a bike on a busy street in which there is the possibility of getting hit by a car), but are appropriate in many other situations. As an illustration, at one of my workshops a mother reported that she told her eight-year-old daughter to wear a scarf and gloves when she went out to play. Her daughter responded that she didn&#146;t need these pieces of clothing, that it was not very cold outdoors. Within a couple of minutes the disagreement led to screaming and yelling from both mother and daughter; the mother responded by handing her daughter the following punishment: she was not permitted to go outside and she lost television for the next two days. This mother noted that her daughter often questioned her authority and that power struggles were not unusual. I responded that if there was not the possibility of her daughter freezing, it might be best to change the usual negative script and simply say, &#147;If you feel you don&#146;t need your gloves or scarf right now that&#146;s okay, but if it gets colder out you can come in and get them. &#148; I added, &#147;A natural consequence will be that your daughter gets cold.</paragraph><paragraph parID="66">While logical consequences may, at times, overlap with natural consequences, logical consequences involve action taken on the part of parents in response to the behavior of their children. Logical consequences should not be harsh, arbitrary, or inconsistent. If logical consequences are too severe, such as when we rely on spanking or demeaning words, children are more likely to resent us rather than learn from us. If logical consequences are arbitrary and inconsistent, changing from one moment to the next, perhaps based on the mood of the parent, children will have a more difficult time learning right from wrong; they will have greater difficulty developing accountability and self-discipline. As Dr. Sam Goldstein and I discuss in our book &#147;Raising Resilient Children,&#148; consequences should fit the &#147;crime&#148; and as much as possible our children should be aware of the rules and consequences in advance. While they may vary from one child to the next, they should be guided by a couple of principles I highlighted in my first article about discipline. One common example is when children argue with their parents that they do not need to wear gloves on a chilly day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="67">I talked about selecting our battlegrounds carefully and in an empathic and hopefully humorous way I asked the mother, &#147;What would have happened if your daughter had gone outside without her gloves or scarf? Was the weather so cold that she was in danger of freezing? &#148; This mother smiled and said, &#147;No,&#148; but then added in a more serious tone, &#147;but my daughter has to learn that she cannot dictate to me. &#148; I agreed but suggested that she consider which issues warrant taking a strong stand and which do not. This mother asked me what might be an alternative approach. If she doesn&#146;t want to come in and get her gloves, I am certain she will place her hands in her pockets. I received a humorous call from this mother a few days later.</paragraph><paragraph parID="68">She said, &#147;My daughter seemed stunned at first when I followed the approach you suggested. Much to my surprise and delight, she came in about 30 minutes later and said that the temperature had dropped and she put on her gloves. He was constantly late getting ready for school each morning. When he missed the school bus, one of them drove him to school. They felt that their son was capable of getting ready on time and that when they drove him to school they were actually reinforcing his tardiness and not helping him to learn to be more responsible for his behavior. They decided to tell their son that if he were not ready when the bus arrived, he would have a choice: either walk to school (a safe, 3/4 mile walk) or remain home and miss school for the day. They felt comfortable offering this second choice since they knew that he liked school; a similar choice would not be wise if the child did not want to go to school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="69">It has been my experience that providing children with reasonable choices lessens power struggles and increases cooperation. Very importantly, they also engaged him in a problem-solving discussion that involved possible steps he could take to ensure he would be ready on time. Even with all of this planning, their son was late for the school bus. His parents wisely adhered to the consequence that had been established, not deterred by their son offering excuses and saying he would not be late again. He ended up walking to school, where a notation was made of his tardiness. It was the last time he was late for the bus. Although their daughter was not thrilled by this consequence, she bought a new bike with her own money.</paragraph><paragraph parID="70">If there had been some unexpected circumstance like mechanical problems, I would have been more tolerant, but what happened was within my son&#146;s control. In ending this article about the use of natural and logical consequences as productive disciplinary practices, I wish to emphasize once more the main points from my two earlier columns about discipline, namely, corporal punishment presents many problems and that an approach that focuses on prevention is very effective. Even though I follow the advice in your Child Training and Discipline tapes she still persists in her stubborn disobedience. Strong-willed children need both extra love and extra discipline. With a strong-willed child you just get the parental challenges early and in concentrated doses. Many parents wonder when and how to start discipline for their babies. Call it what you will - tantrum, outburst, melt down, or fit - it is a scene familiar to almost every parent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="71">You may feel embarrassed, angry, frustrated or confused, but no matter what you're feeling, you're not alone. Tantrums are a common occurrence for children between 18 months and 4 years old. They are noted among the most common behavioral problems reported by parents. In fact, recent research indicates that 90% of parents say that their 3-year-old has had a tantrum in the last month! Positive Discipline Toddlers Cooperate! You can get around this frustrating state of affairs by changing your approach.</paragraph><paragraph parID="72">Let's look at two situations - first the typical (Titanic) way: Baby Discipline? But what should a parent do if a 6-month old baby refuses toys and wants to be constantly held? What to do if a 9-month old child makes a b-line for a CD-rack to play with the treasured music collection? What if a 10-month old baby flings food from the high chair? A few days ago my four-year-old son asked me if he could do a craft project-I was in the middle of tidying the house and with visions of glue, construction paper and mess going through my head, I said "No, honey...not right now."

When you don't give children discipline and rules and structure when they're small, they will need increasing intervention from parents as they get older because they have not internalized self-discipline, or values, or even simple politeness. While you can get away with this when they're small, when they're older you've created a monster, because when they make bad decisions at the ages of 11, or 13, or even 16, they can get in a lot of trouble. That's why some parents don't really start disciplining until the child hits the pre-teen or teen years and starts causing real trouble. Is it actually fair to take a child on a plane for 5 hours and then ignore her? For the past ten minutes, I've witnessed your son yell at you, slap you, and refuse to sit beside you in a time-out. Your only response when he wiggled away was to yell, "You're going straight to bed when we get home."</paragraph><paragraph parID="74">We often forget that one of the most powerful forms of discipline is positive feedback and encouragement. Practice positive feedback and encouragement. I believe that misbehavior will be lessened when we &#147;catch our children doing something good,&#148; when we set aside &#147;special times&#148; to be with each child alone, when we share in their interests, when we respond to their mistakes with words of encouragement rather than criticism, and when we write them notes of endearment (although adolescents may not admit it, most have told me that they enjoy receiving such notes even if they call them &#147;silly&#148; or &#147;corny&#148;). I often emphasize at my workshops that discipline is most effective within a loving relationship, a relationship in which children know we care about them and that we recognize their strengths and their inner goodness. Each time we communicate an awareness of their strengths we help to prevent misbehavior from occurring, and we are practicing preventive discipline. Such an approach is far more effective and less exhausting than one that focuses on the best ways of responding to or punishing children when they act in ways that are inappropriate. In my work with parents, teachers, and other caregivers, I have placed increasing emphasis on prevention as an effective disciplinary philosophy; however, I recognize that even when we practice the guidelines outlined in this article, many situations will still arise in which our children misbehave and in which they must learn that there are consequences for their behavior.</paragraph><paragraph parID="75">In my last newsletter I discussed spanking as a disciplinary technique. I presented research findings as well as my own observations about corporal punishment, arguing that it is a counterproductive form of discipline that may actually reinforce the very behaviors parents wish to stop in their children. Spanking increases the probability of kids hitting other kids. It often leads to antisocial behavior like cheating and getting into trouble at school. When they are teenagers, these children are more likely to hit their parents. When they grow up, kids who have been spanked are more likely to hit their partners than kids who haven&#146;t. I would like to review four guidelines that are part of a prevention approach.</paragraph><paragraph parID="76">I am not suggesting that if we follow these guidelines we will erase all misbehavior, but rather that adherence to these guidelines will lessen the occurrence of such behavior, minimize stress and tension in one&#146;s household, and foster the development of self-discipline in our children. Have realistic expectations for your children and anticipate situations that are likely to elicit misbehavior. The main point of these two examples is not that we do away with goals for our children but rather that we continually examine whether what we expect of them is in keeping with what they can deliver and with their developmental level. When it is not, we must modify our expectations and in the process disciplinary problems will be minimized or prevented. Understand why your child is acting the way he or she is. In my career as a psychologist I have encountered many well-meaning parents who punish their children because of misguided assumptions about their child&#146;s behavior. In another situation, a 10-year-old girl demonstrated what her parents said was increased &#147;sassiness&#148; towards them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="77">She often refused to help out with household responsibilities and would find ways of putting them down. Her mother said, &#147;Up until a year ago, she was cooperative. The meeting went very well as both parents openly discussed their initial anxieties when father was diagnosed with cancer, but they added that in fact he was fine now. The parents reported that after the meeting their daughter &#147;appeared noticeably more happy and relaxed and her sassiness and lack of cooperation disappeared. There should be consequences when our children misbehave but as these last two cases indicate, sometimes misbehavior is handled best by focusing on what is eliciting the behavior rather than imposing stricter and harsher consequences. Select your battlegrounds carefully. As we perceive our children&#146;s lives in this way we may recognize that what appears to be a major issue at the moment may be a small, inconsequential part of our child&#146;s life terrain.</paragraph><paragraph parID="78">The main forms of punishment involved grounding them or not permitting them to watch television. While these forms of punishment might not seem overly harsh, to these girls they were, actually leading to greater tension and anger in the household. As parents we must take into consideration our children&#146;s unique temperaments and skills, and decide what areas are important to be firm about and what behaviors are best left alone. For some strong-willed children, insisting that they finish all of their cereal or that they not wear two different colored socks to school may not be worth the battle since it leads to increased struggles, anger, and harsher disciplinary techniques. Show that you recognize and accept the reason the child is doing what, in your judgment, is the wrong thing: It teaches perspective taking, and may lead the child to develop the ability to put himself in other people's shoes. However, at home, she frequently feels comfortable behaving in a manner as you describe -- rude, rolling eyes, deep sighs, growls.</paragraph><paragraph parID="79">That is fine, but we also decided that these behaviors are not acceptable and have sat down with her to explain that although she may be frustrated, as a member of our family, we have certain expectations from her. Basically, you need to stick to a response something like: ''The way you're speaking to me is not respectful. It makes me less willing to do something for you, so I won't be able to ...[drive you to the mall, make your lunch, let Alex sleep over, take you ice skating, etc.] Very calmly. For 7- year-olds, the recommended consequence is often instant removal from family activities; for adult children it could be instant termination of financial support. You need to have appropriate consequences ready. As the mom of a 6 1/2 year old girl, I am soooo familiar with this behavior! At school, my daughter is a polite, somewhat quiet, studious child (or so I've been told!)</paragraph><paragraph parID="80">We have decided that she is trying on ''a new hat'' so to speak and testing these new behaviors. One is that she respects the others in the family and treats them as she would like to be treated. The other is that she can use her words to express her displeasure or anger in an appropriate way -- growling, sighing , etc ... when asked to do something is not allowed. When she does this, she is sent to her room for a 15 minute time out (she doesn't like this at all). It seems to work. Although she wants to try these new behaviors, she is also seeking out what her boundaries are regarding them, so we feel that we need to be quite clear -- so far it has worked! I have been breaking her of the habit, so I feel some justification to respond to you here.</paragraph><paragraph parID="81">I am kinda old school, I think my kids should always show respect to adults, especially their parents unless they are just harmlessly fooling around. The nasty tone and negative attitude when I have done nothing to warrant it really gets me mad. (1) I tell ''jenny'' to please act nice and I point out that her negative attitude is not appreciated. (2) I explain that being nasty with me will only result in me being nastier back and I ask if she would like us to be nice to each other or screaming at each other. (3) Still acting rude, I calmly and quietly send her to her room to stay there alone until she wants to be nice, but I decide when she is ready to be nice, not by her just blurting out ''but I am going to be nice!'' (4) The last straw is actually giving her a time out in her room for x-number of hours, or canceling any TV or outings for the day. ''Jenny'' does better on just about anything when she knows ahead of time what the consequences are going to be.</paragraph><paragraph parID="82">Sometimes I have to remind myself of this and have a little meeting with her to set down my expectations and what the consequences will be for breaches. I have an 8 year old daughter. I know that she loves me but she is consistently mean to me. I feel like making a recording of her and playing it to her so she can see how mean she is. (At times I have written the things she says down and then read them back to her.) She consistently says things like, ''I hate you,'' ''You're mean'' etc. I am very nice to her and never ever say things like this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="83">Also, she does not hear this kind of talk in our house. She has always felt free to be mean to me. When she was younger, she would sometimes hit me. She is extremely well behaved at school, at friends' houses and just about everywhere else. She can also be mean to my husband, but it is not as bad as she is with me. I know she feels that I am the safest person around to be mean to. When I say something to her about it, she always says she is sorry but she can't seem to stop herself from saying the mean things.</paragraph><paragraph parID="84">Any advise is much appreciated. Fed Up My kids are too small for me to respond to this as a parent, but as a new parent I have been thinking about this a lot in terms of my treatment of my own mother. My brothers and I were horrible to her for years and years. We called her stupid, we told her she didn't know anything....Granted we were pre-teens and teenagers, but with 5 of us in the house it went on for a long time! My only advice is to stop this now. Find a system that works for you, and fix the behavior the way you would any other misbehavior--by discipline, therapy, or whatever your chosen method.</paragraph><paragraph parID="85">I am now an adult and (as backwards as it may seem) angry at my parents for not making us treat my mother better. She was a wonderful mother (as I am sure you are), and you both deserve to be treated as such. sad I was mean to Mom Take away tv, toys, ice cream, etc. Her memory and ability to refrain will improve. Talk over substitutes, other words to express her anger that aren't as hurtful to you. You don't want your daughter treating people in her relationships this way and she will, because that is what she is learning to do. bpn fan I love the idea that you have thought about your kid being mean as not acceptable.</paragraph><paragraph parID="86">There is no ''safe'' place to be mean as mean is not a personality trait our society encourages. At 8 she can TOTALLY get it! You and your partner ned to jump in the game and it needs to go something like this. '' mom, you suck!'' Turn around and in a very strong voice say, ''that is a mean and hurtful thing to say, you are NOT ALLOWED to speak to ME or ANYONE that way. Please go to to the most boring room in the house (your bedroom is probably more boring than hers) for five minutes and when you come out we will have this conversation again and you will speak to me politely.'' If this continues to be a problem please expect to lose some things you enjoy as I REALLY don't ENJOY being spoken to like this!''</paragraph><paragraph parID="87">no brats allowed! I have the same thing with my 8 year old son. Partly, it's because Dad is fun and leanient. Partly, I guess because of the close relationship. After confronting it, promises not to ever do it again (until the next day), etc, I lost it. I put him in the doghouse (his term). I met my obligations as a parent -- meals, transportation to school, help with homework and music practice.</paragraph><paragraph parID="88">All very friendly and supportive. What I did NOT do was any of the things which make his life more pleasant -- playdates (including permitting them at friends' houses), TV, computer access, making him something special for dinner (though I didn't serve anything odious). I told him that everyone has to contribute to our family by being supportive to one another and by building a happy home. The regular blow-ups and rudeness needed to be dealt with once, instead of everyday. As a human being and family member, I deserve respect. If you think I'm mean and don't understand the extra effort I make for you, I may as well stop. When he asked how long he'd be in the doghouse, I said I didn't know, but I wanted it to be long enough that we didn't return to regular ''this is not acceptible'' and ''I promise I'll never do it again'' scenarios.</paragraph><paragraph parID="89">I had to time it when there were no upcoming playdates(and made an exception when a mom needed us to take her kid -- but my kid understood it was a favor to the mom, not him) and nothing fun upcoming for the weekend. After a week of stellar behavior and general helpfulness, I asked if he understood that it was imperative to have a happy, respectful home. We've been good since. It helps that he knows I'll put him back in the doghouse, if need be. Look, I tolerated it for a long time because I understand that kids work a lot of things out with their moms. I still understand the occassional meltdowns and why home is the safe place for them. But, it just didn't make sense to let a kid treat me disrespectfully.</paragraph><paragraph parID="90">I also think it's a reasonable message that no human being wants to put out for you if you're not appreciative or treat them badly. I remained pleasant while he was in the doghouse, so it fit with the ''happy home'' -- I would just remind him that he was not receiving any privileges (many he had previously assumed were inalienable rights). Good luck. anne Sounds like there is a pattern developing. If I was in your shoes, I guess I would try to do something different from what I've done before to shake things up. If she speaks to you like that tell her right away that what she has said is hurtful to you and that you are not going to stay in the room with her.</paragraph><paragraph parID="91">If you are in the car, pull over and say a few things to her. Seems like she needs an outlet for her aggressions or hurt or angry feelings and it should'nt be you! Maybe you two should go to some family therapy. good luck! Outrageous! Let me ask you this, would you let anyone else in the world treat you like that? The mother is the one person who should be treated with utmost respect in a child's life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="92">Here's the thing, you can sit around and analyze and sympathize with your daughter, and obviously there's something there she needs to express (though I'm sure it's not your fault!) , or you can nip this behavior in the bud, take charge of this 8 year old, and make it stop. It doesn't matter what she's feeling, she can tell you about it later when she learns some respect. By allowing this, you are setting up the guidelines for your relationship with her for the rest of her life! She will be that 30 year old who blames you , in front of others, for her ....fill in the blank, whatever she's unhappy about. My advice is to find a counselor who, instead of helping your child, they help you. Help you to grow some nerve and whip ( not physically ) that girl into shape.</paragraph><paragraph parID="93">She obviously can do it. She does it at school, other places. She does it to you because you let her. Children push because they want to know their limits. She probably gets more and more angry, because she's scared of her emotions, they're more than she knows what to do with. It's your job to tell her what to do with those emotions, and it starts with speaking respectfully. I'm sure you don't need to be pounded on during this difficult time, but I will say this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="94">You're the parent. What happens in your house is your responsibility. Help her. Alison I think it's too bad that you're condoning your daughter's behavior. She treats you that way because you have permitted her to. It's time to set boundaries. Frankly, if you don't stop this now, it's going to get a lot worse when she is a teen- ager!</paragraph><paragraph parID="95">Believe me! The time is now to nip this in the bud and frankly tell her, ''If you're not going to respect me and continue to be mean to me, then I don't need to be around you. When you decide to treat me with dignity and respect that I deserve as YOUR MOTHER, then you can have the PRIVILEGE of having a relationship with me. Period!'' Walk away every time she is mean to you so that she knows you mean business and she can think about it but stay firm! It may seem brash to you but you are doing HER a big favor by setting boundaries. Good luck!</paragraph><paragraph parID="96">p.s. Rent the movie FIRELIGHT to get a better idea of what I'm talking about as I, too, am a mother of a difficult child so I'm not judging you here at all! anon Are you tolerating her behavior? How strongly do you feel about this? She may need firmer limits and tangible consequences from you to curb her more disrespectful behavior, if you really want it to stop. This can be simply choosing something she doesn't want to lose and removing if for a couple days, consistently, each time she crosses a line with you. It would be important to be clear on what behaviors (words) need to stop, and to follow through with a said consequence. I suppose you could do a reward system too for improved behavior, though I don't think rewarding her for treating you well is good on principle nor as effective.</paragraph><paragraph parID="97">Kids/people often need tangible consequences to stop a behavior (E.g. If I really got a ticket every time I sped, maybe I wouldn't, assuming I'm not rich - choose your consequence wisely. A cop coming to my window and simply scolding me wouldn't do the trick.) I think it is very common for kids to vent and take out their stress on their parents, and does not necessarily reflect any great issue, but as long as you let her unleash on you she may very well continue. I also worry about the message being sent about letting yourself be disrespected. Anon If you allow your child to hit you, or be disrespectful to you, you are setting her up for life-long problems. If she treats others the way you let her treat you, she will always be unhappy.</paragraph><paragraph parID="98">Children need rules and boundaries. Rules are an expression of love. In my experience, parents who allow their children to run wild are usually just too lazy or too self- involved to provide boundaries for their kids. What is your excuse? And what is your husband's excuse? Aghast I'm sorry about this, but seriously - your child is mean to you because you are LETTING her. Who sets the rules in the house?</paragraph><paragraph parID="99">You. Who decides the consequences of rule breaking? Who ensures that consequences are followed through? Lay out the rules clearly. Write them down on a poster board and post them in the house. Be clear about the consequences for rude or mean behavior. Take away her most precious possessions and privileges if she breaks the rules.</paragraph><paragraph parID="100">Take them away for a week at least. If she continues her behavior, keep taking things away until her room is empty except for furniture and she has no privileges. If you do not do this, you will end up with an INTOLERABLE teen who thinks she can get away with anything. Boundaries are loving You need to stop her. Tell her that's not acceptable language between family members, let alone a child to a parent. I have an 8 year old daughter too, and she gets mad at me when the situation sometimes isn't what she wants it to be, but we have never tolerated the kids hitting us or calling us names.</paragraph><paragraph parID="101">When it has come close to that, we've said, ''Hey, don't talk to me in that tone of voice. I'm your mother, and it's my job to make rules that keep you safe and teach you how to be a good person. It's ok if you don't like the rules and you feel angry, but it is NOT ok for you to say ______to me.'' If she continues the rude, disrespectful behavior, punish her by taking away a privilege or giving her a time-out to cool down, and tell her she needs to apologize to you before she regains her privilege or comes out of time-out. You're the Mom--You're in charge! While you should not have to tolerate being treated disrespectfully and setting strong boundaries is important, as well as modeling intolerance for unkindness, I think it's important to remember what one child psychologist I consulted pointed out: children DESERVE and parents EARN. That is, children should be able to EXPECT to be loved and accepted unconditionally by their parents, parents EARN their children's love and acceptance (of course, children are hard-wired to love you regardless, but don't you want that to last into adulthood?)</paragraph><paragraph parID="102">While I think getting some help with setting good boundaries and limits (there are lots of good books out there that can help you, I was surprised no one recommended any), if you do consult a counselor, find one that will care for BOTH of your needs and feelings, not one that will create a dynamic of the two of you against your daughter. For crying out loud, she is only 8 years old! She needs to know, deep down, that you are on her side no matter what. Yes, her behavior MUST CHANGE and you will help her find better ways to express whatever she needs to express. If your child doesn't believe that you are on her side, how can you possibly expect her to be guided by you when she is a teen, and you have NO CONTROL over her? Yes, you certainly need to do something, and your daughter needs you to do something, because it's not good for her to see you putting up with this kind of thing from her. She needs to see her mom as strong, powerful and ''in charge.''</paragraph><paragraph parID="103">Kids feel safer that way! Some books you might want to check out: ''Loving Your Child Is Not Enough,'' ''1, 2, 3 Magic,'' ''Positive Discipline,'' ''Unconditional Parenting'' A search on Amazon under ''Child Discipline'' will bring up many more books, no doubt, and the library will likely have many of them, if you don't want or can't spend the money to buy them. I recommend reading more than one, as no one book is likely to be completely perfect in every way, but you'll get something from each one you read. Best of luck to you and your daughter, you both deserve it! Well, everyone seemed to think that strong discipline would work, and that you just had to make your daughter tow the line. I don't think this method necessarily works for every child. My son is four, so my comments don't carry the weight of experience with a child of your daughter's age.</paragraph><paragraph parID="104">Still, he is a handful in this regard, and I have found that the tow the line idea works sometimes, but also can really backfire. For him, I've found one thing that really works is to purposely misinterpret what he says every time. So if he says, ''You stupidosaurus''--for a while this was his favorite thing to say to not just me, but everyone--I decided finally (after fruitless punishments that just increased his use of this word) to start saying, ''You're right, I am (or daddy is) a stupendousasaurus. Thank you so much for noticing.'' He HATED this, and kept testing and testing my resolve to misinterpret this. With a smile on my face and seemingly genuine gratitude, I just kept thanking him and rephrasing what he was saying to what would sound nice. We did this repeatedly for a couple of days, and then voila, no more stupidosaurus comments to anyone.</paragraph><paragraph parID="105">For him, this tactic works far, far better than the strong discipline techniques, which he sort of feeds on for some reason. Those techniques generally just make things worse. I am having an issue with my almost 6 yr. old daughter - she is incredibly rude to adults outside our family. She is otherwise a fun-loving joyous kind child but in the last month I have been getting feedback from our carpooling family that she does not speak when they ask her a question - she instead looks out the window and ignores them - the 4th grader we carpool with (who picks her up at her classroom to head home) reports that my daughter is reluctant to go with her and drags her heels and pretty much makes people wait for her to be ready to go. Today in her classroom after school her teacher asked her to help her with something and my daughter said flat out ''no''. It seems she has entered the self-centered zone where she believes that the world will wait for her and that it also revolves around her.</paragraph><paragraph parID="106">There is no change at home or at school (that I can discover) that would make her so reluctant to be polite. She seems to have become entrenched in this behavior almost as a result of our discussing it at home. I want to help her overcome this problem - we have tried taking away privileges, playdates, extra fun stuff, etc. and are about to embark on a sticker/incentive plan to get her to change her behavior. She is very precocious and smart and is aware that her behavior is hurting people's feelings. any advice out there? nice mama rude daughter Your daughter's behavior doesn't sound that unusual to me for a six year old.</paragraph><paragraph parID="107">My son is seven and I work in his classroom a lot and the not answering thing is BIG. Not that I accept that but it just isn't that unusual. Also dawdling is the number one complaint among my friends. I did notice however that is does seem to be around the carpooling in particular that this is coming up. Any possibility she is intimidated by the other children she rides with or in any way doesn't feel comfortable with them? It could all relate to one incident that would seem minor to an adult but left her nervous. And kids her age can't always articulate what is bothering them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="108">My son would not want to carpool with anyone he didn't know exceedlingly well and I find that is not unusual among his friends. That said, my strategies for coping with not being answered is to state the answer (and I often will make the answer something I know my son would not agree to just to get a response)... ''I assume you don't want french fries since you didn't answer me.'' For the dawdling I will use a timer. I used to set a timer while my son put on his shoes. I didn't hang out and I didn't say anything. just set the timer - worked great. I also will often make it a race (which I always let him win) to go places, change clothes, etc.</paragraph><paragraph parID="109">That also works well. Don't be too hard on her, annoying as it is, it is typical of this age. She hasn't suddenly turned into some rude child that will forget all her good manners. Heck if that is the worst you get at this age you are doing well. They go out into the world and try to make sense of it and it can be scary. Elementary school is a very big deal and comes with lots of huge changes and expectations. It is a time of transition and lots of parents find 6 a challenging age.</paragraph><paragraph parID="110">Good Luck! Does anyone out there know what is ''age-appropriate'' rudeness (if there is such a thing) and just plain old unacceptable rudeness in a seven year old? Our daughter is very polite in public, or with teachers and strangers, but at home, she is very rude to us. Her responses to what we believe are resonable requests (granted, they usually involve transitions, which is another issue all together!) , seem curt, rude, and disrepectful. I am talking about such responses as growling, ''Fine!'' (and stomping off to execute the request, such as teeth brushing), or eye rolling and the like.</paragraph><paragraph parID="111">Also, we are interested in what works best for this age group-- loss of privileges or a reward system of some kind in order to curb this behavior? Tired Mama Boy, do I know this one! My (almost) seven year old was really getting rude. Mostly by the tone of her voice, which I was ignoring until I realized that this was NOT the way I wanted to be spoken to, by anyone. So I sat her down and told her that we had a new ''politeness policy'' in our house. I was very specific about the behaviors that I wanted her to change, and that violation of the policy would result in loss of video/TV watching time (this is highly coveted and somewhat sparsely given in our house).</paragraph><paragraph parID="112">We had been through the need for behavior change when she was four, and we found that rewards for good behavior weren't ANYWHERE near as effective as what we term ''loss of privileges''. The main thing (for us) was to find something she really loved and would miss. She had to lose privileges (i.e. video time) only 2 or 3 times in the beginning and now still responds beautifully to just the threat of loss of privileges (counting to five is the signal), three years later. It's important to be specific about what you're asking, and perhaps give a warning the first time or two (but your kid will have to really lose privileges to get the point that you're serious). a happy mom I have to ask what makes your daughter polite in public? Is it the knowledge that she shouldn't be rude, and/or that being rude would upset you?</paragraph><paragraph parID="113">Does she know you would find that unacceptable? If yes to any of the above, then there is no difference to how she should be treated at home. So many parents nowadays try to reason with their children as if they were adults. We seem to forget that they are children. Parents need to be adamant and say NO when necessary. I have a four year old niece who can be as wild as any child at home, but she always knows when to say ''please and thank you'' anywhere - including at home and she knows how to behave outside the home. There were never any exceptions to this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="114">There was no reward system or privileges - just a very serious ''No, we do not act like this towards anyone, esp. to our elders.'' She is also allowed to state her feelings but she knows her boundaries - adults are still the authority and must be treated with respect, not as peers. anon There's no ''age-appropriate rudeness''; rudeness is inappropriate at every age. I had a similar problem with rudeness in my kids, and found a fantastic book that changed how our family functions: ''Backtalk: 4 Steps to Ending Rude Behavior in Your Kids'' by Audrey Ricker and Carolyn Crowder. It's recommended on the parents of teens website, but covers all ages from three to adult.

(My sister works in Parks and Rec in SoCal and I've heard some stories...) Also, I want to make sure that there is structure/discipline because I can see the potential for a bit of chaos. I felt like my just-finished-K daughter was perfectly safe there all day, and she liked it all right but didn't love it. They lead the kids in games when they're not doing ceramics or cooking or print-making, and thus no one seems to get bored or get into trouble. My grand-daughter(8)and our friend and neighbor's son have been going to Art Yowza for years and always look forward to their time there and learning something new. I've found that if parents clearly plan what they want to teach and keep in mind what their child can learn based on his stage of development, then the specific strategies are easier to work out. Requests like "Behave" or "Be nice" don't have much meaning for a child under about 10.</paragraph><paragraph parID="116">Be specific about what you want your child to do. Tell him to "Stop yelling" or "Give Logan's truck back to him." Here are some examples I hear about regularly, along with some strategies for getting better results. The parent's instructions are too general. The task is too big for the child. Very few young children can handle "Clean your room." Children respond better to "Pick up the blocks" or "Put your clothes in the hamper."</paragraph><paragraph parID="117">Many smaller jobs completed successfully fuel the child for completion. What is the correct way to discipline small children? How do I get her to not touch our things? If you don't want her to touch your expensive crystal vase, just put it on a high shelf out of her reach. Your approach to discipline will change as your daughter matures and can understand the consequences of her actions. Just keep in mind that discipline has to do with teaching, not punishment. Rewarding your daughter for good behaviour is a form of discipline.</paragraph><paragraph parID="118">Time-outs, sticker charts, television denial-for many, none of these measures will actually result in long-term behavior change, according to researchers at two academic institutions. While I thought of a million ways I could discipline the child, I never said a word to the mom or to the child. How do you discipline your child in a positive way? Children who either learned or grew up teaching themselves discipline and self-control had a better future that didn't include credit card debts, substance abuse, or low self-esteem. Tantrum Tamer: New Ways Parents Can Stop Bad Behavior Forget everything you may have read about coping with children's temper tantrums. The child, a 10-year-old boy, sat behind me and proceeded to kick the back of my chair (incessant thump thump thumps) every 5 minutes for each hour (and there were long, long hours) we sat on the bus. The child also whined, made fun of, and talked back to his mom throughout the entire ride.</paragraph><paragraph parID="119">What bothered me most besides the child's spoiled behavior was the mom's inability to discipline her son. With every complaint, the mom would bend to her son's will and try to appease him; when he threw a tantrum after not getting an ice cream cone, she gave up after 5 minutes and bought him a treat. She couldn't bear disappointing him or having him stay mad at her. The child's dad looked the other way, never saying a word either. This got me thinking how Parents readers would handle disciplining other people's children . Would you talk to the child directly or to the parent? How would you handle any unbearable situation?</paragraph><paragraph parID="120">In an AP article , Beagley's attorney revealed that the mom originally filmed a video of her threatening  the children with cold showers, but no action was taken. During the segment, she shared a video that her 10-year-old daughter taped of Beagley disciplining one of her 7-year-old twin sons with the above-mentioned tactics. To get me to stop, my grandmother rubbed a chili pepper against my thumb. What are some no-fail discipline tactics you use? What are the ones you would never use? According to ScienceDaily , self-control was defined by factors such as a child's threshold for tolerance, persistence in sticking with and executing goals, ability to think before acting, and patience in waiting. So instead of just natural intelligence, self-control can be important in propeling children to success.</paragraph><paragraph parID="121">Does your child have good self-control? What parenting tips do you have to help your kids to be more disciplined? If you have any concerns about your own health or the health of your child, you should always consult with a physician or other healthcare professional. I have a four year old daughter, and she has really started to rebel. I feel so bad. I also need some tips for talking to her about God. My husband and I are believers, but we come from different denominations.</paragraph><paragraph parID="122">It has been difficult for us to find a church where we both have our spiritual needs met. You wouldn't let anyone else speak to you that way so why should you accept her disrespectful behavior? Remind her that you don't speak to her in that way, in that tone, or to anyone else. Let her know that while she has every right to feel the way she does, she certainly doesn't have the right to speak to you (or anyone) the way she does. Sometimes writing a letter can be a good way to communicate when one person doesn't seem willing or ready to listen. I'm sure you don't have any reason to apologize to her, but asking her to forgive you is a different matter altogether. She obviously blames you for something and letting her know that your goal is to move forward and create a healthy relationship with her is your priority, it's only a matter of time before she comes around.</paragraph><paragraph parID="123">By the way, teenage girls are challenging without the added circumstance of having parents who are suddenly divorced. Again, reminding her that she has every right to feel the way she does is important, but that you and her mother know that with time, she will come to understand that this new situation is best for all of you. Whatever the age of your child, it's important to be consistent when it comes to discipline. Timeouts and consequences are also effective discipline strategies for this age group. Again, consistency is crucial, as is follow-through. Make good on any promises of discipline or else you risk undermining your authority. Kids have to believe that you mean what you say.</paragraph><paragraph parID="124">This is not to say you can't give second chances or allow a certain margin of error, but for the most part, you should act on what you say. Be careful not to make unrealistic threats of punishment ("Slam that door and you'll never watch TV again!") in anger, since not following through could weaken all your threats. If you threaten to turn the car around and go home if the squabbling in the backseat doesn't stop, make sure you do exactly that. The credibility you'll gain with your kids is much more valuable than a lost beach day. Huge punishments may take away your power as a parent. If you ground your son or daughter for a month, your child may not feel motivated to change behaviors because everything has already been taken away.</paragraph><paragraph parID="125">Perhaps no form of discipline is more controversial than spanking. Here are some reasons why experts discourage spanking: Spanking teaches kids that it's OK to hit when they're angry. Spanking can physically harm children. Rather than teaching kids how to change their behavior, spanking makes them fearful of their parents and merely teaches them to avoid getting caught. For kids seeking attention by acting out, spanking may inadvertently "reward" them - negative attention is better than no attention at all. If parents don't stick to the rules and consequences they set up, their kids aren't likely to either.</paragraph><paragraph parID="126">Here are some ideas about how to vary your approach to discipline to best fit your family. Ages 6 to 8 A Word About Spanking Make sure your daughter sees that her good behaviors result in positive responses from you. When her behavior is bad, try to redirect her behavior or have her practice an opposite, positive behavior. Don't expect immediate results right away; learning takes time. Just try to be consistent, firm and fair.</paragraph><paragraph parID="127">A. Wait until both of you calm down; it will be easier for you to give a consequence for the misbehavior and teach him better ways of behaving. When he's calm, he will be able to listen and learn more easily. A. Kids crave any kind of attention, positive or negative. If you pay more attention to misbehaviors than to good behaviors, your child will probably misbehave because that's how she gets your attention. Try to recognize your daughter's good behavior more often and minimize the attention you give to her negative behavior. Once you're calm, give your child a consequence. Try to have a few different consequences prepared beforehand.</paragraph><paragraph parID="128">Decide what type of consequence you will use for certain misbehaviors, then consistently use that consequence each time the misbehavior occurs. You could also write down the consequences and post them on the refrigerator as a reminder to you and your child. When my child is having a tantrum, it is hard for me to correct him. Is there anything I can do? Q. My daughter enjoys getting my attention by doing bad things. Consequences don't seem to work. What's the best way to handle this?</paragraph><paragraph parID="129">That drives me crazy and I've really had to be disciplined about making her repeat her thoughts in Spanish while my husband lets it slide a little, because he knows what she's trying to say. The convergence of two news stories should be a wakeup call to alert us to the fact that there is a brutal movement in America that legitimizes child abuse in the name of God. One story involves a judge whipping his daughter with a belt on a YouTube clip that has gone viral. The other involves books by Evangelical leaders on child rearing that advocate spanking, even beating. But what many people don't seem to realize is that in the Evangelical alternative universe of the home school movement, tightly knit church communities and the cult following of a number of bigtime leaders and authors, physical punishment of children has been glorified for years. As a story in the New York Times illustrates - "Preaching Virtue of Spanking, Even as Deaths Fuel Debate" - a famous Evangelical author and his co-author wife, Michael and Debi Pearl, are being tied to several deaths of children killed by parents alleged to be using the Pearls' "methods" advocated in their book To Train Up a Child . And according to ABC News , a prominent Texas judge who was filmed beating his disabled daughter with a belt and cursing at her said he was merely disciplining his child and did nothing wrong.</paragraph><paragraph parID="130">He may or may not have read the Pearls book but his "methods" and "I-was-just-disciplining" reaction to his outing as an abuser should make us all ask ourselves about just what some "experts" on child raising are not only telling people to do TO children but the routine abuse they have legitimized in far right "conservative" and Evangelical circles. "No, in my mind I haven't done anything wrong other than discipline my child," Judge William Adams told KZTV Wednesday after the YouTube video went viral on the internet. Hillary Adams, the daughter who is seen being beaten in the video, secretly recorded the beating and uploaded it to YouTube Oct. 27. "I just wanted somebody to see it and tell me, 'no, Hillary this wasn't right and I'm glad you were able to grow up and move on past this' and 'no, your Dad wasn't right,'" Hillary Adams said told ABC News' Chris Cuomo. If Hillary wants someone to tell her what her father did wasn't right she will look in vain to the Evangelical Religious Right. It is some of the most respected Evangelical discipline gurus that have made beating children not just "respectable" in conservative religious circles but even turning it into an "I'm just disciplining my child" godly activity. In 1977 James Dobson, founder of the "Focus on the Family" religious empire and radio program, wrote a book called Dare To Discipline whose purpose was to get parents to beat their children.</paragraph><paragraph parID="131">Beating was the way God "wants" mothers and fathers to "discipline" children from toddlerhood on. Perhaps Dobson wrote his perverted, sadistic book because he was beaten as a child and was damaged as he then damaged millions of others through his "ministry" later. In his book Dobson glorified a sadomasochistic/spiritual ritual of "discipline." He said he wanted to stop a "liberal" trend in America that was moving away from the godly thrashing of infants. He wanted to help "restore" America to God and the good old days of child hitting. "I remember the beatings and the fighting and yelling and insane rules and all the Bill Gothard rules and then trancing out," he wrote Dec. 1 under the monicker "nghtmrchld26&#8243; on a Web forum for former Pentecostal Christians. It was no coincidence that the judge was mercilessly beating a young girl.</paragraph><paragraph parID="132">Keeping women down is a Dobson theme along with child beating. And if the daughter won't submit, well, there's always that handy belt. Dobson extols his view of child beating in The Strong Willed Child . (Living Books 1992) He makes a parallel between beating children and beating dogs: Thus, a healthy baby can keep his mother hopping around his nursery twelve hours a day (or night) by simply forcing air past his sandpaper larynx. It certainly explains why I place such stress on the proper response to willful defiance during childhood, for that rebellion can plant the seeds of personal disaster. In cheerfully telling about beating Siggie - a story that should have put Dobson in prison for animal cruelty - Dobson is telling his readers to similarly beat their children - something he's advocated as "spanking" until a child collapses in tears into a parent's arms.</paragraph><paragraph parID="133">In their book To Train Up a Child (1994) they advocate beating babies. In the book they recommend "switching" a 7-month-old on the bare bottom or leg 7 to 8 times for getting angry. (p74) If the baby is still angry to do it again until he gives in to the pain. The "switch" for an under 1 year old they recommend is from a willow tree and/or a 12 inch RULER! Kevin and Elizabeth Schatz of Paradise, California, are accused of murdering their 7-year-old adopted daughter during a "discipline session." The couple is also charged with the torture of their 11-year-old adopted daughter and cruelty to a child for signs of bruising discovered on their 10-year-old biological son. The parents allegedly used a 15 inch length of plastic tubing used for plumbing to beat the children, a practice recommended in the book "To Train Up a Child" by Michael and Debi Pearl of "No Greater Joy Ministries."</paragraph><paragraph parID="134">The same plumbing supply tools were linked to a North Carolina child's death in 2006, when a devotee of the Pearls accidentally killed her 4-year-old son by suffocating him in tightly wrapped blankets. Police later found out about the Pearls' recommendations to beat children with this type of plumbing supply tubing from a Salon Magazine article, "Spare the quarter-inch plumbing supply line, spoil the child." Mr. Pearl, who has no degree or training in child development, writes in his book that he and his wife used "the same principles the Amish use to train their stubborn mules" - namely, "switches." On their web site, the Pearls write that "switching" or giving "licks" with a plumbing supply line is a "real attention getter." Whole "Christian" organizations are alleged to be abusing children methodically. They're here because they've been disobedient, they've been disrespectful.' He's talking about young offenders who are sent to the center by the Marion County Juvenile Court.</paragraph><paragraph parID="135">That investigation involves Teresa Landis, whose 10-year-old daughter spent nearly a year at the center - sent there, according to Judge Payne, after she attacked a teacher and a school bus driver. The girl allegedly was confined in a so-called "quiet room" for five days at a time; restrained by teenage "leaders" who would sit on her; and hit with a wooden paddle 14 times. At least once, the family contends, she was prevented from going to the bathroom and then forced to sit in her own urine. Dobson, the Pearls and Gothard all have big followings in Rick Perry's hang-em'-high "Christian" Texas where the daughter-beating judge presides over court when not beating a child. And Texas is where Evangelical leader Gary North is based as he writes and preaches his Reconstructionist/Dominionist theology about applying literal Old Testament law - including the execution of " incorrigible youths " as mandated by the Bible. Here is how Evangelical "man of God" Dobson describes how to beat a child using his own as a guide. The walls vibrated from my daughter Janet's rock music.</paragraph><paragraph parID="136">I asked her to turn it down. She didn't, so I did. My 15-year-old turned the knob back and stood in front of her stereo, challenging me to try again. The thought of fighting her repulsed me. Janet's rebellion caught me off guard. Janet's drinking, profanity, sex, smoking and drug use turned our Christian, single-parent family home upside down. Others thought that having her dad die when Janet was only nine caused it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="137">Family and church friends gave conflicting advice. I begged God for help and soaked the bedspread with tears. I told myself that when I found the right fix, my daughter would again love her family, attend church and do well in school. God showed me the futility of my quest and forced me to ask some hard questions. Did I trust Him to care for her? I struggled and argued, but finally whispered, "Yes." Even as God provided spiritual insight, He knew I needed practical help.</paragraph><paragraph parID="138">But when Janet ran away, I made the agonizing decision to put her in a lockdown facility. One counsellor explained why groundings and withholding privileges sometimes fail. "For many angry teens, long-term discipline feeds their temper. The counsellor encouraged immediate discipline, such as cleaning a bathroom or washing a car. When the task is finished, let the offense drop." Instead, if she wanted to do something unacceptable, I was to explain why I disapproved and refuse to drive, give money or help. My new options provided me ways to enforce limits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="139">I'd feel as though I hated her, then be crushed by guilt. These emotions made being consistent impossible. After praying, with new, quiet strength I regained control. Janet noticed and tried to break it by her poor behaviour. "Your daughter enjoys a fight," a counsellor said. When I would realize we'd begun yelling, I'd say, "I've made my decision; I'm done discussing it." One day, I'll have to put your stuff on the porch and change the locks."</paragraph><paragraph parID="140">She yelled back, "You do that, and I'll make your life hell." And I can call the police, but is that really the relationship you want with me?" "No," she said. At 17, Janet said, "I want to move out, but can I visit, come for dinner sometimes and do the holidays?" Janet is 29 now, and each year her choices improve, even though she has not yet returned to Jesus Christ. We respect each other and she often says to me, "I'm sorry for how I treated you, Mom." In my decision to trust God, He transformed the tears and pain.</paragraph><paragraph parID="141">He helped me love Janet unconditionally and wait for the gradual restoration of my daughter. Though his outbursts are frustrating, keep in mind his actions are not acts of defiance directed toward you; he's developing independence and learning how to express frustration.

Parenting Blog How can kids learn to behave if they're never punished? I would never hit them, but what about timeouts and consequences? Everyone knows that children need discipline. "</paragraph><paragraph parID="142">To answer this question, I went to the best source I know:  My children. They were never punished, including with timeouts or parent-contrived consequences. They were never even yelled more than once or twice. So there was none of the teaching that most of us associate with conventional discipline. Me: "But how did you learn to behave, without punishment?" My daughter: "Why would punishment teach you to behave? That just makes kids dislike their parents, and disrespect them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="143">Why would kids follow someone they don't respect?" Me: "What do you mean by 'follow'?" My daughter: "You know, doing what you say. I know so many kids who had a bad relationship with their parents so they lied and rebelled as soon as they could. Me: "But how did you learn not to hit,  for instance?" My son: "Empathy. I always knew, for as far back as I can remember, that I didn't want to hit other kids because it would hurt them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="144">But sometimes if I was very upset, I didn't care. But because you always understood, I was able to stop myself from hurting someone else. And because you understood why I would have those angry feelings, it made me feel better about myself, too." My daughter: "Either way--if you punish or not--the child learns not to hit. But if you're punishing to teach him, he learns not to hit so that he doesn't suffer. If you're using empathy to teach him, he learns not to hit because it hurts the other person. So he becomes a better person.</paragraph><paragraph parID="145">He cares more about other people." I have higher standards than most parents I know, which my kids sometimes challenge. And I set plenty of limits, but always with empathy and understanding of my kids' feelings. Sure, kids need "discipline." But the verb "to discipline" means "to guide." There are many thousands of parents like me, who have never used any conventional discipline at all, and whose children have grown into wonderful teenagers and adults. All young humans have days when their emotions get the best of them, just like all "grown up" humans.</paragraph><paragraph parID="146">What about consequences? If we impose them, that's punishment. Punishment has been clearly shown in study after study to have the opposite of the effect we want. Instead of the child focusing on the bad result of what they did, such as hurting another person, they focus on how unfair the parent is. When the child forgets lunch, he's hungry, and the next day he remembers it. When the six year old socks her playmate, the consequence is that the other child doesn't like her any more, and the other parent no longer wants her to come play. But that is not a punishment imposed by the parent.</paragraph><paragraph parID="147">It's a natural consequence. Some said her rebellion happened because of poor discipline. Whatever the reason, I had to figure out how to handle the present and help my daughter. Confused and hurting, I went to the only place I knew to go for answers - the spot next to my bed where I prayed. I searched desperately for something to "fix" Janet - the right words, the right book, the right counsellor. My yes helped me see that no perfect fix to sin existed apart from the Cross. I worked with the school, our church and a therapist.</paragraph><paragraph parID="148">After her previous outbursts or bad behaviour, I'd grounded Janet and withheld privileges, but my discipline intensified Janet's anger. This time when I tracked her down and insisted she come home, she threatened to call children's services if I touched her. The trained staff at the lockdown facility provided tough answers. During the time enforced, the teen dwells on the restrictions, seething inside." "Say it once and then make it clear there will be no friends, phone, food or fun until it's done. Another counsellor helped by saying, "Your daughter is too big to control, but you can control what is yours." This kept me from telling Janet what she could or could not do, which was like tossing a match into gasoline.</paragraph><paragraph parID="149">Whether going to the mall on a school night or heading to the home of a questionable friend, Janet was on her own. God's practical and spiritual help allowed me to see how my turbulent emotions affected my parenting. I needed strength to get beyond them. Her actions hurt, but somehow I did what I had to and stopped arguing. "She gets an adrenaline rush from it. You need to refuse to feed it." She'd slam doors and knock pictures off walls.</paragraph><paragraph parID="150">Knots tightened in my stomach, but I would not fight. One night when I'd taken away the use of my car from Janet, she lost control. I confronted her behaviour, but she refused to stop. I responded in a quiet voice. Pain squeezed at my heart as I answered, "Yes, I know you can. Time-outs are a very effective way to change behaviors if they are used correctly. My daughter's friend of 10 years appears to have stolen an old cell phone of ours.</paragraph><paragraph parID="151">I tried to teach both girls a lesson about responsibility by not allowing the friend to come to my daughter's birthday party. I confronted the mother about this and asked if we could sit down with the girls and talk about it. Talk with your daughter about what important friendship qualities are and let her make the decision if she feels this friend is a good friend or not. Then if she makes the decision to continue her friendship, teach her how to be assertive with her friend if a situation like that should arise again. Talk about things they can do to rebuild trust in their friendship and how setting boundaries might be appropriate until the trust is back. At the moment, we certainly have to consider 'another way' because our son can barely read; we cannot let him play outside by himself (he wanders off, has hit people and others may take advantage of him); employment prospects are limited; and he may never be able to live independently. " We face criticism from people , either for not disciplining our son (yes, he is naughty, but sometimes he's just distressed/confused), or for being 'picky' about our daughter's food (but it is vital that we keep to her diet)."</paragraph><paragraph parID="152">I'd like to share a few excerpts from the messages I received in my email inbox today: Well . . . on Christmas Eve, I kicked my daughter out of my house (she is my eldest) because for the umpteenth time she didn't have any desire to follow rules, not lie or respect her family . . . and . . . My 13-year-old son does not mind me at all. Every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie, and he has also been stealing things and getting into trouble at school. His attitude is, "I don't care about anything," and I am afraid that his bad language and bad habits will start affecting my three-year-old . . . also . . . We have currently been experiencing some problems with our 14-year-old daughter. She has tried to run away once and has gotten into fights at school. She is very defiant towards us and is really hateful toward her younger brother - age 10. and . . . We are dealing with our 15-year-old daughter who is convinced she's a lesbian, is cutting and possibly has an eating disorder. Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do as a parent is to give up some of your power over your teen.</paragraph><paragraph parID="153">I tell parents all the time, if you want your child to grow up, you have to let go of some of the power and control over their life. It boils down to one very simple concept: the best way to empower your teenager is to gradually share the power you have, allowing them more and more control and responsibility for their own decisions. To empower your child, hand them the responsibility for their own decisions. For the helicopter parent, the habit of picking up the slack, covering all the bases, answering all the questions, solving all the problems, and making everything easy for their teen is not doing the teenager any real favours. Instead, it keeps them immature, dependent and powerless. Responsibility becomes an internal life force when parents empower a child to make decisions, line out their options, define the consequences and then let them choose. If your teenager is fully capable of doing well, communicate that belief to him by handing over more and more control and responsibility.</paragraph><paragraph parID="154">Fortunately, most teens want to take control of things in their life, so let them. Let them make choices, but also let them bear the responsibility for those choices. Line out their options, define the consequences and then let them choose. Then, don't rescue them or hold back one bit in relation to enforcing consequences for their poor choices. And don't forget to congratulate and reward them for making good choices! When empowered, your teen's expectations will shift away from leaning on mom and dad to fix everything, to understanding that they are the ones responsible for how things turn out. They may make many mistakes before they begin to understand what good decision-making looks like.</paragraph><paragraph parID="155">And they may even try every trick in the book to get you to rescue them out of their poor choices. But don't do it! Hold them responsible, just as they will someday be held accountable as an adult. When to exercise full parental power In situations like this, empowerment shifts back to the parent, who must intervene and retake decisive control. In this case, I recommend taking whatever measures are necessary to ensure the safety of your teen. It's up to you to create a solution, such as counselling or rehab, or he may need to live somewhere else while going through this.</paragraph><paragraph parID="156">And you, too, will need to surround yourself with good counsel and a group of godly friends who are willing to pray with you and encourage you. Before you determine the needed changes, get the right kind of counsel to map out a plan of action. Then, with plan in hand, and with all the power you can muster, communicate this message: "Honey, we love you. Nothing you do or say will make us love you any less, and nothing you do or say will make us love you more. But we are not going to live like this anymore. Since you are not making the right choices on your own, here is what will change in your life, as of today . . ." Dear Kristin, I have several Certified Positive Discipline Associates who help me asnwer questions.</paragraph><paragraph parID="157">If you read any of the Positive Discipline books, you will find that we don't advocate punishment of any kind. Rather we use methods that are respectful and designed to teach life skills that help children develop good character. Christine Haymond has done an excellent job (to follow) of respectfully answering your question. Jane Nelsen Q. My eight year old is having some difficulties completing school work, staying focused,  and talking at inappropriate times. She is very bright, kind, and tries to always be helpful. Her 2nd grade class has cards that they use to let parent's know how the child's day was.</paragraph><paragraph parID="158">The students are told when to change their cards after they have been warned a few times to behave appropriately. Green - good day (very few warnings) Blue - Not good (few warning and must turn card) Yellow - Time out 5 minutes Orange - go to another class, time out 10 minutes Red - time out and must write what they did to get to this point and what the resolution to this behavior is. and warning after that involve parent contact and principal contact. I have a great relationship with my daughter's teacher and we speak frequently about Alanna's behavior. She is also at a loss as to how to get Alanna on track. She even gives Alanna more chances than the other kids cause she feels that my husband and I work with her all the time so she lets something's slide. Last week Alanna brought home 4 blue and one green.</paragraph><paragraph parID="159">So far this week she has brought home a green and a blue. She has been spanked, is currently grounded, and I don't know what to do. This discipline is not working. Her teacher has moved her desk away from other's in the class and she still can't get her work done. When she tries really hard she does great but lately she just can't focus and stay on top of things. Yesterday the other students in her class were done with their seat work by 11:00 and she didn't finish until 2:00. I tell her how proud I am when she brings home green and tell her how disappointed I am when she doesn't.</paragraph><paragraph parID="160">I know she can do it cause before the holiday break she had 2 full weeks of green. Last night I had Alanna sit in her room and write down what she has to do at school, how she will do this, and what she felt the consequences should be if she gets blue. I want to be positive, not yell at her, or spank her cause it breaks my heart when she is in trouble. It is hard cause I want to go do things with her but when she is grounded, I don't feel I can. Please help me search for better ways to discipline her or motivate her to behave while in school. Dear Kristin, I am a teacher in Ohio who discovered Positive Discipline five years ago. Your letter touched me both as a mother and an educator.</paragraph><paragraph parID="161">I currently teach middle school, but spent 8 years as an elementary teacher. I also had a child for whom school was never easy ( he is 23 now) so I really empathize and feel like little bits of me have played every part your letter describes- First I have to say that Alanna is lucky to have a mom who is willing to seek help when things just don't "feel right". A supportive/ cooperative relationship with the classroom teacher is very important and I am always willing to go that extra mile when I know the parent is cooperative, interested, and involved. But I have also learned that it is just as important to understand school through the eyes of the child. The teacher must feel that the card system works for most of the kids, because it sounds like a lot of work so it must be worth it. I am reluctant to ever criticize another teacher's style, because we are all very different. That is the beauty of public education.</paragraph><paragraph parID="162">Over the years kids are exposed to many different kinds of "bosses". But I would to share a story from my own classroom experience and explain how my home/school system has evolved over the past 16 years. My first two years of teaching ( 3rd grade) I sent home daily "passbooks" to parents, often with comments. I used stars- one to four- to indicate behavior and the kids had to bring them back signed. --This seemingly worked well . My intentions were good : to make the kids accountable for their behavior, and of course to involve the parents-. Well, year number three brought me a lesson by the name of Adam.-Adam was a one star kind of kid .</paragraph><paragraph parID="163">Two on a rare day. During the fourth week of school Adam became even worse than usual. I began to think I should design a minus star passbook especially for him! I called his mom and in the course of the call realized that he was being punished at home every night. No T.V. In bed early. No allowance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="164">The mom felt she was supporting my intentions. We both meant well. But what I had done, I realized after much thought, was build a wall of mistrust between Adam and I. He felt I was tattling. I imagined how powerless this must have made him feel, and academics were enough of a challenge for him. We talked and he said he felt like he "lived in the land of What's the use? " That was my last year with the home passbook.</paragraph><paragraph parID="165">And I have learned since not to sell kids short- to allow them their dignity in the workplace, i.e. school. Of course I call parents when necessary, but my first responsibility is to respect the child. That was a dramatic "aha!" for me as a teacher. Later, I would read the words "getting into the child's world" in Positive Discipline and realized that Adam took me there. Imagine going home from a bad day at work, just glad to be in the one place you can just "be". Your husband is waiting for you, hands on hips, scowling.</paragraph><paragraph parID="166">Your boss just called him to tell him about your day! What an awful thought! Everyone is ganging up on me! I'm wondering if you might say to your little girl something like " you know, Alanna, I'm not sure how I feel about the cards you bring home. I liked them at first, but now I'm feeling a little confused. What do you think? " She might be very relieved.</paragraph><paragraph parID="167">I don't think this would be "going against the teacher" in any way- just showing some empathy and being willing to listen to her feelings and perceptions. Perhaps you could separate school and home consequences for awhile and see if that helps her anxiety level. And yours! I faced a similar situation with my son Mark in 4th grade. He was a distractible kid ( and like your daughter very kind and thoughtful. who needed lots of positive strokes, and the discipline system that year was very negative. As a teacher/ mom I did not want to make a lot of fuss, as I know this can impact kids badly, but I let him vent with me as needed and we talked plenty that year about what he had to do to get through.</paragraph><paragraph parID="168">He often needed extra time to finish I did speak with the teacher about this. As long as he was working, It was important to me as his mom that the effort was acknowledged. As long as Alanna is finishing her work, I would offer her encouraging words. She is probably comparing herself to the faster students ( and is faster always better in the grown up world?!) so letting her know you appreciate her effort is important. I always had to remind myself that the best parts of my son- his kindness, sensitivity, and gentle spirit would never receive grades on his report card. Keep reading, and have faith in your parenting instincts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="169">Your child will guide you to good answers. Christine Haymond, Canton, Ohio, Certified Positive Discipline Associate Aren't we lucky?!!!) Q: My eight year old is still wetting himself during the day. It seems to be when he is anxious or occupied with the computer. He also still wets at night so we walk him in the wee hours. He also chews on his shirt when throughout the day.</paragraph><paragraph parID="170">You can work with him on feeling more relaxed and expressing his emotions, which may relieve the daytime problem. You're right to wake him in the wee hours. There are some devices you can purchase that will help your son's body recognize the releasing of urine and wake him. You can also set an alarm clock in the middle of the night so he must arouse enough to turn it off and that may remind him to go to the bathroom before going back to sleep. They get angry when an adult -- mom or dad -- thwarts their plans. They don't understand many of the words spoken to them -- and they're often at a loss for the right words to express their emotions. Because of their rapid metabolism, toddlers have boundless energy so sitting still is nearly impossible, or at least torturous.</paragraph><paragraph parID="171">And they do get hungry more often than adults, so provide small snacks throughout the day.

Recently she had two friends (girl age 6 and boy age 7) visit for an overnight playdate. I allowed them to play downstairs in the family room while I was upstairs. After they left I discovered that the expensive bedspread had been torn on the guestroom bed next to the family room. My daughter admitted that she and her friends stood on high stools and jumped onto the bed. She admitted that all of them lied to me when I periodically called down the stairs to check on them. As a consequence I told her that she cannot go "trick or treating".</paragraph><paragraph parID="173">She got very upset and said that she wishes I were dead! I feel devastated. Was the punishment too harsh? Can I change my mind? A: Your six-year-old daughter is peer conscious already. That means she cares what her little friends think of her and will, consequently, do what's necessary to "be liked" by them. Sometimes you'll discover broken items after kids come to play.</paragraph><paragraph parID="174">It's typical, although not pleasant or tolerable, that they try to cover up the crime. At least your daughter admitted to you that she &amp;amp; her friends behaved inappropriately. Thank her for tell you the truth. Your consequence to not go "trick or treating" seems a bit removed from the behavior. It's too late now to back down on your decision, but in the future try to find a consequence that matches the "crime." For example, you could have her help you repair the expensive bedspread or prohibit her friends from coming over for a period of time. Don't fret that she wishes you were dead.</paragraph><paragraph parID="175">At this age, saying things like that or "I hate you" is about as strong as a younger can get in verbal expression. She may mean it at the heat of the moment, but over the course of the day. Of course it doesn't feel good to hear those words from your child, but the best response is to simply say, "I love you and not your behavior." Saying it this way helps her to see you can do both at the same time, love her and not accept her behavior. This is a skillful way to provide unconditional love.

If they leave a toy on the ground and the dog chews it, its my fault because I didn't pick it up in time. They are becoming brats and I'm using every tactic I know of to help teach them there are consequences to certain behaviors. Any suggestions you have to offer would be greatly appreciated! show/hide answer A: It's common for youngsters to blame others and divert accountability. I suggest you simply make a statement like, "You threw the toy and that's why it broke."</paragraph><paragraph parID="179">Simple and direct. Don't get hooked into a debate with them and don't take the ball of guilt -- you did nothing wrong. During neutral times (when everyone is calm) you can make comments that shows you accept responsibility for your behavior, too. Remember, children copy adults. If your sons hear you say something like, "I forgot to put my shoe away and the dog chewed it," then they'll see you can accept your own shortcomings. Gradually, with your patience, modeling, and explanations they will learn to accept responsibility for their own behavior. Q: My boys, ages 6 and 7, are very disrespectful.</paragraph><paragraph parID="180">They think they can have the last word and speak to us however they please. We are very consistant in addressing the issue as it occurs, but it seems that we aren't makin any progress. We talk to them about what is appropriate ways to speak to us, we've used time out, spankings, grounding, positive reinforcement when they do speak respectfully....Am I doing something wrong or is persistance the key? A: It can be discouraging when your children are disrespectful. But, I encourage you to set boundaries on how they talk to you. Just as you wouldn't allow a friend or your spouse to verbally abuse you, neither should you allow it from children. Remember, too, your importance as their role model.</paragraph><paragraph parID="181">Speak respectfully to your children and others so your children will see how to talk to other people. Model polite words such as "thank you" and "please" throughout your day. Use a calm tone and don't yell as this teaches kids that screaming is appropriate communication. Persistance is the key to teaching children. They often need to hear -- or see -- something several times before the lesson is internalized. Once you identify an inappropriate behavior, stop the behavior immediately. Once the behavior is stopped, issue an immediate consequence (a time-out, removal of toy, etc.).</paragraph><paragraph parID="182">Then discuss and practice a more appropriate behavior. His behaviors show that he needs reminding. So set your expectations of how you want him to play by telling him what he SHOULD do and not what he SHOULDN'T do. Focus on the positive. Then ask him to show you how to correctly play with a different toy. My 7-year-old son is beginning to hate school. He is impulsive and as a result, often has to sit apart from his classmates.</paragraph><paragraph parID="183">This consequence only intensifies his behavior. I have provided suggestions on how to handle his impulsiveness, but the school's staff will only administer the school's policy of separation. He is not trying to be defiant, and he is now feeling like he is being punished for who he is, not for what he is doing. He feels singled out. What are my options? This situation, if allowed to continue, will hamper his education. So you must act now to stop it from continuing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="184">Did your son go to preschool? How was his kindergarten experience? Preschool and kindergarten are when impulsive behaviors are dealt with through redirection, teaching and practicing more appropriate responses. Impulsive behavior is normal; we all have impulses. As we grow and develop, we learn to curb our impulses through social interaction. How other people respond to our behavior helps clue us in to whether or not that behavior is acceptable. We adjust our behavior in order to get positive reactions from those around us.</paragraph><paragraph parID="185">In school, the social reaction to a student's impulsive behavior is separation from the group in the "safe seat" or "buddy room." While there, he is missing out on classroom fun and educational instruction. Some children do not connect their behaviors and the consequences of their behaviors very quickly. It takes administering consistent and repeated responses before a child learns that his behavior is linked to the consequences. Your son has not made the connection yet. Perhaps he is strong-willed or stubborn, and thus it may take more time. Don't be surprised if the behavior worsens at first.</paragraph><paragraph parID="186">This is common but not long-lasting. There are steps you can take to help your son with this developmental lesson. First, you must support the school's staff and their policy on how to handle impulsive behavior. Second, find out what is occurring at school directly prior to the inappropriate behavior. Work with your son each day after school by teaching and then practicing a more acceptable behavior to use in place of his unacceptable behavior. The goal is to teach him the necessary social skills to succeed in the classroom and wherever else life takes him. You can work on this by using a three-step approach that we call Preventive Teaching:</paragraph><paragraph parID="187">Describe the positive behavior. Be very clear and demonstrate it if necessary. Give him a reason to do it this way. Make this reason a "kid" reason that shows him how he will benefit from doing it this way. Have him practice what you just taught him. Keep it brief and make it fun. The comment about being "punished for who he is" is not likely his words, but something he heard an adult say.</paragraph><paragraph parID="188">Kids will say whatever they need to in order for their parents to take their side and defend them, whether they are truly the victims of the situation or not. You are not trying to change his personality. Neither is the school's staff. The goal is to help your son succeed and be happier in an environment that he will be in for many years to come. Do her problems seem to be more severe than anyone else's? Okay, her parents have problems - they fight. Other kids may think that she's even popular.</paragraph><paragraph parID="189">So how come a kid like Ellen thinks seriously about killing herself? I think the answer can be summed up in one sentence: Ellen feels absolutely and totally cut off, alone. Ellen feels that she's in a world in which she has no connections with friends, with family. I really think he has panic attacks and I don't know how to deal with this. He said he was scared to be there alone without me anymore and wouldn't stay. He gets hysterical and inconsolable. She has good friends here but she seems fixated on the fact that we've uprooted her.</paragraph><paragraph parID="190">I want to let her express her feelings, but I feel she becomes abusive. She was there for him without pressuring him, and eventually he was able to open up and unload a bit. Cary knows what is going on with her child and while it is distressing that she can't control everything in his environment, she is better off knowing than not knowing. My five-year-old son is like a thoroughbred: bright, quick, talented -- and explosive. Our eight-year-old has been experiencing what looks like separation anxiety. Alan Flashman, MD, answers: It sounds like your eight-year-old has a tendency towards anxiety, which is far from unusual in eight-year-olds. My eight-year-old daughter doesn't want to go to school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="191">Eight-year-olds' preoccupations usually belong to one of three realms: 1. She doesn't want to play at friends' houses, only wants friends to come to our house. When she leaves for school in the morning, she asks, "Are you SURE you'll be here when I get home?" Last summer, we needed to leave her and her 13-year-old brother at their grandmother's for a week and she called home crying every day. Our daughter is generally cautious but other than this anxiety behavior, she is happy, generally well behaved and does well in school. How can we understand this behavior and how can we help her? Dear Dr. Sylvia, We listen to your radio program every week and have found this site as a way to ask a question that is pretty complicated.</paragraph><paragraph parID="192">We have guardianship of our six-year-old granddaughter, Shelley, daughter of our adopted daughter who came to us at age three. Shelley's mom has many problems, among them attachment issues that have followed her all her life. Shelley, her firstborn, was eight weeks premature, and is a twin whose sister died at one month from complications of pre-maturity. Shelley has been with us permanently since she was four-and-a-half. She is now six. Lately she's been expressing feelings of abandonment: "My mommy loves Jennifer (her two-year-old half sister) better than me. Our six-year-old son, who is a middle child, has a very hard time taking criticism.</paragraph><paragraph parID="193">When we scold him for hurting someone accidentally or for bad behavior he gets extremely angry and embarrassed and usually runs off to his room yelling and crying and doesn't want to see us. A short while later, his rage seems to abate, but we're wondering if there is something we can do to help him accept criticism and understand that he needn't be so angry when such things happen. A Guest Expert Marcia Levine, MA, answers: Many children have rather colorful reactions at this age to correction and to blows to their self-esteem. Your son is at the age when he has internalized your standards; they have become his own. Amanda, 13 1/2, is not one of the "in" kids whom everyone wants to sit next to. "What's wrong with me," she's wondering, "and how will I deal with the anxiety of the first day?" I always hate the first day of school.</paragraph><paragraph parID="194">Not the shopping part - that I like. It's fun to get new clothes and shoes. And I love wrapping all my books so everything looks perfect, and getting all the new notebooks and pens, and cool erasers. But I hate thinking about who I'm gonna sit near. I know that all the "in kids" are gonna stick together, and I never fit with them. I wish I could be part of that crowd and that everyone would fight to sit near me. But I'm just a loser and always have to go over to someone and ask, "Do you wanna sit next to me?"</paragraph><paragraph parID="195">It makes me so nervous. For the past few months, she has said she doesn't feel well a couple of times a week and I let her stay home. She complains of stomach aches but the doctor says there's nothing wrong. Now she's fallen behind and has missed a lot. She likes her teacher and has friends. I don't know if this means the school isn't good or there are other problems. What do you suggest?</paragraph><paragraph parID="196">A Guest expert Silvia Silberman, MA, answers: You may think of a tummy ache or other body pain as a way of expressing pain, preoccupation or anxiety that is otherwise difficult to express. My 6 1/2 year old son has started throwing major temper tantrums and fits when he doesn't get his way. We have tried ignoring him, putting him in his room with the door shut until he calms down, taking privileges away, rewarding positive behavior and days....not much seems to be working. I'm asking, because I wonder if there has been some change in his life that, while it might look minor from an outsider, he is not coping with well. She's testing some boundaries, because in her mind, she thinks she's more grown up than she is. As for the pressures you are feeling from family members, it might be good to speak with one of our counselors . They may have some great ideas about standing your ground regarding the discipline of your son while protecting those precious relationships with your relatives.</paragraph><paragraph parID="197">It doesn't help that grandparents and aunts/uncles tell me that I am being too hard when we discipline the negative behavior and that by removing privileges we are punishing others and not just him. I feel like I am at a loss. My husband and I are stressed and can't figure this kid out. We are sure that he will grow out of this eventually but how do you teach him that it's okay to be upset, and cry even, when things don't happen the way you'd like but you can't throw a fit and try to get your way? How do you tell grandparents to step back and let you raise your child? How do you deal? It's bad enough that my 4 year old, when asked by his pre-k teacher "What do you do the night before Christmas", answered her with "I water the tree and ** is throwing a fit and crying.</paragraph><paragraph parID="198">He's not getting any presents." While that's funny it shows me that my youngest realizes that this behavior is not good. Why can't my 6 year old? I too have a six-year-old, and so I completely understand. I often wonder how situations just like the one you've described with your own son (and one I've had many times with my daughter) can make me feel at such a loss. I read another moderator's post yesterday, and in it she commented that Kevin Leman is known for quoting, "He has seen the enemy, and they are small." LOL</paragraph><paragraph parID="199">In your post, you indicated that he has just now started throwing these irrational temper tantrums. How recent? On the flip side, he might just be going through a stage like my daughter. If you don't think there is anything going on that might be driving his behavior, there are a few things I looked up to see if they might be helpful. It sounds like you've tried quite a few consequences, so these may or may not be of use. However, from one mom to another, everything is worth mentioning if there is a chance it will help restore some peace. That said, check them out when you can.</paragraph><paragraph parID="200">Give them a call - o.k? I'm praying for you, tyandnoahsmom. Let us know how you are doing. And to the rest of the community out there - any advice for her? I'm thinking that the two of us aren't the only ones who have had to deal with this. She gets mad at him and he gets mad at her and then she takes it out on me. It is particularly difficult for children to respond well to a bonus parent disciplining them in the early stages of a relationship.</paragraph><paragraph parID="201">If your partner makes the rules for your daughter and you expect her to obey them, I believe you are decreasing the possibility dramatically that she will ever have a good relationship with him or him with her. "It is particularly difficult for children to respond well to a bonus parent disciplining them in the early stages of a relationship." Also, it is important not to dramatically change the rules in your children's lives, simply as a result of living with your new partner. It is not surprising to me that she is acting out, angry and refusing to comply. While perhaps she does need counseling, I believe that you will find it more useful to get counseling for the whole family, or for you and your partner, to learn how to help your daughter adjust, without feeling as if she's being punished for struggling to do so. Mom's in the Middle Last year I married a wonderful man.</paragraph><paragraph parID="202">I thought we would have a happy life, but now we live in his house and my ten-year-old daughter hates it. Her dad was never around, and my husband, her bonus dad, wants to form a close knit family, but he also wants to have set rules, mostly to keep her room clean, pick up after herself, and get good grades in school. She is really resisting his rules, which I don't think he is asking too much from her. My 13 year old son thinks my husband is wonderful and is very happy. I certainly understand how much you want to make this new family work, and also that you'd like your children to have a father who is interested in them and active in their lives. However, I think that perhaps your enthusiasm for this "happy family" is interfering somewhat with your being able to empathize with your daughter's point of view. Despite the fact that her father was not involved in her life, he is still her father and any new man in this role will feel like a threat to her.</paragraph><paragraph parID="203">You have made a very quick transition to this new relationship, and living with your new partner, but perhaps it has not yet been enough time for your daughter to get used to it. You will have to be patient and give her more time. It is very important that you be the one to set the rules in the house, not him. She should not have to see him as a 'bad guy' in any way. He should be the 'fun', lenient parent who is more like a friend than a parent. This may need to be for a year or more, so they can bond successfully in a positive way. Your daughter will struggle even more if she thinks this relationship is responsible for making her life difficult.</paragraph><paragraph parID="204">Lastly, you should keep in mind that it could be very difficult for her to have moved into his home, feeling very displaced and without any say in the matter. Remember, your eagerness to be in this relationship, will not force her to easily fit in with your plan, even if you wish she would do so. Forcing her to be the only one to have counseling will not be a healthy message for her nor will it produce the result that you ultimately want--peace in your family. she seems to understand us just fine! second time around will be different I am sorry to hear your house feels so chaotic right now, but unfortunately I think that is bound to happen with two kids under 4. I know if I were trying to juggle the many needs, wants, developemntal phases, etc. of two small children I would be pretty frustrated, too.</paragraph><paragraph parID="205">I know many folks who have sworn by Sears &amp; their kids are well behaved, I know others who followed the same advice &amp; their kids are... let's just say not-so-well-behaved. I think it is important to take what works for you &amp; your family-- given you &amp; your child's tempermant/personality, resources, etc-- &amp; pass on the rest. Obviously being consistent, picking your 'battles' &amp; having a sense of humor are all of utmost importance. Best of luck! Every once in a while I read something like this that makes me think that I'm too lenient, so I "get tough" for a day or two until we're both completely miserable, then I decide to go back to enjoying eachother. I'm pretty sure I'm not raising a brat, but I guess we'll see! Hi concerned parent and Sears rebel,</paragraph><paragraph parID="206">I also have two kids, ages five and under and used the Sears method for babyhood. I don't think you should feel that you've spoiled your kids by having tried to provide a strong attachment and I don't think you should feel you have to adopt the Sears approach as the answer to all of your parenting issues. (By the way, I agree that the Sears family must have a lot of help that most of us can't afford. The Baby Book is only about the 0 to 2 y.o. crowd, and attachment parenting shouldn't mean permissive parenting--have you read Sears and Sears' Discipline Book which focuses on parenting kids ages 2 to 10? It clearly advocates for parents to be firm authoritative disciplinarians--in fact they emphasized that parents must be able to say "NO" to their children and that not being able to do so was a problem they often saw with parents. Sears would say that kids need more discipline (teaching)and boundaries as they begin to leave infancy and enter childhood. In my experience attachment parenting in the first year or two is highly appropriate, but the role of parents (call it attachment parenting or not) as kids get older is different, and for some of us, more challenging.</paragraph><paragraph parID="207">The most basic parenting advice any of us needs to be reminded of is that you have to consider temperament and developmental stage. Not all methods work with all kids, and what works at one stage might not at another. Know that you've provided a loving foundation and work on expanding your parenting repetoire. I don't have all the answers (and I'm sure Dr. Sears, though wise, doesn't either!) , so I'll close with some non-Sears book and speaker recommendations that I've found helpful: Kids, Parents, and Power Struggles has perhaps the most concrete and helpful ideas of any book on discipline that I've read. I also appreciated the Positive Discipline books (one for ages 0 to 3, and another for ages 3 to 6). Raising a Son and Raising a Daughter by the Eliums are also useful and supportive of nurturing but authoritative parenting.</paragraph><paragraph parID="208">Aletha Solter has written several interesting books and Patty Wipfler is a local parent trainer (these two will make you feel good about having done the "attachment parenting" route) and their basic philosophies are similar: "cyring is good--set appropriate limits but provide nurturing and let them cry when they need to". You might want to read Aletha's books The Aware Baby and Crying and Tantrums for suppport around your daughter's screaming. GOOD LUCK on this wild and wonderful parenting journey!!! another mom trying to figure it all out! It's been fascinating to read all the various posts about Sears and by now I think the original poster has gotten a lot of support for setting limits with her children and also the message that Attachment Parenting definitely does include setting firm and consistent limits. What I think is important to emphasize is the reason people follow the Sears methods - what the goal is. For me is was to make my child a priority, to understand his needs, to listen respectfully to him, to make him feel secure.</paragraph><paragraph parID="209">I have a really lovely six year old who is kind and capable of great empathy toward others. He is affectionate, makes friends easily and bonds well with adults. We have a very close connection and he talks easily to me about what he is feeling. We have all along set clear and consistent limits, I think this is part of being a loving parent. I believe this is what we got from being AP parents. Not that you can't get there with other methods - I just wanted to explain the reason people follow the Sears methods... the end results can be so wonderful. Just thought I'd add to the already voluminous mail on this topic.</paragraph><paragraph parID="210">Not about Sears per se, but to me there is a big difference between "attachment" parenting and "permissive" parenting (although they can certainly overlap). Attachment parenting may even facilitate discipline in some ways as it makes your disapproval or removal a huge punishment (when my 4 yr old acts disrespectfully, I tell her that I don't want to be/play with her when she acts like that and she immediately changes her tune. Not always, of course, but it does work.) Also, every child is different. With our 4 yr old we co-slept, carried her all the time, etc. Now with our newborn, she actually needs to be left alone alot. Sometimes she will fuss and cry and we try everything and finally put her down and she calms down.</paragraph><paragraph parID="211">(Although with our first we did have to wean her from nighttime nursing when she was about 8 months old, and we wish we had done it sooner!) p.s. On the topic of "spoiled kids", materialistic kids and parents who find it difficult to assert their authority, I really recommend a book called "Blessings of a Skinned Knee." (sorry I don't remember the author's name.) It takes a Jewish perspective, but you don't have to be religious or even Jewish to appreciate it. A heart-felt thank you to all the parents who replied to my posting by sharing their stories, and giving good suggestions and words of wisdom. He and his wife have written an entire book on discipline (The Discipline Book: Everything you need to know to have a better-behaved child - from birth to age ten), in which he has a section called "The Importance of Saying No" and states, "It's necessary for a parent to say no to a child so the child can later say no to herself." As far as discipline goes, I subscribe to a sterner form of discipline than I think Sears would countenance.</paragraph><paragraph parID="212">I believe children need limits, and effective discipline, to feel secure. It's not easy and it takes some time, but if you consistently tell your child that screaming is not okay and won't get her what she wants, and follow through by not giving in, your child will eventually stop, or at least reduce the screaming. A child who has always been allowed to scream has no real incentive to stop. If a particular philosophy is not working for your child, you are allowed to change/modify/abandon it. Ultimately, we must listen to our instincts, and through trial and error come up with a parenting style that helps our children gain the skills they need to navigate life as successfully as possible. And children should NOT have the control in the house, parents should. I really, really like the book "Positive Discipline" because it shows an effective way for the parent to remain in control while still respecting the child.</paragraph><paragraph parID="213">He gives many examples throughout all of his books in his own experience of raising his eight children of needing to be assertive and knowing when to say "no" and when to set boundries between being being a loving parent and being in charge. How my husband and I have interpreted Sears is to honor the child's physical and spiritual self and not do authoritarian parenting whereby the child is made to feel helpless and choiceless and powerless. I have seen (read) him caution in his books that to allow a child too much power in the decision-making process, essentially turning the child into an adult, prematurely, can make for an anxious child. I have not gleaned from the book to raise a child without consequences--Sears advocates "natural" consequences with which I agree and have seen work more effectively than unrelated or delayed consequences. He also urges parents not to hit their children, even mildly/slightly, as he considers it poor modelling, cruel, and a defeat in parenting. I feel that, most of all, Sears is advocating respect that comes in the form of non-accusatory, non-judgemental discipline, but, to repeat, I never saw him propone letting a child "rule the roost" (we don't and wouldn't) or to go unchecked about a destructive or unsavory behavior. I also like his idea (really every psychologists' idea) that children who are doing something excessive and/or extreme (or even a persistent mild behavior) are sending an SOS of sorts.</paragraph><paragraph parID="214">I have interpreted Sears to say that every child needs a "voice" and validation in a household, but I don't think that he is advocating a home in which the child gets to indulge every whim or persist with inappropriate behavior. The whole point is to show our children how to control their own behavior in an appropriate manner according to the situation. So I think discipline should be a form of instruction. For me it is children that can govern themselves appropriately according to the ethics in our family. So in this binder you can write down how you want to respond to a temper tamper and how you want to respond to a certain situation before you find yourself in it. Instead read No More Misbehavin': 38 Difficult Behaviors and How to Stop Them by Michele Borba and The Secret Of Happy Children by Steve Biddulph. Put down the books, and raise your children with the morals and manners which you expect.</paragraph><paragraph parID="215">Start today, its never too late, in a few weeks your children will understand that there are different expectations/rules than perhaps were in the past, and slowly and surely, your children will adapt to your new needs. After re-reading "The Difficult Child", especially the Chapter on "Regaining Parental Authority" we are instituting a new world order of clear expectations (explained in calm moments and written down), and clear, not pleasant punishments when rules are not followed. I recommend the Difficult Child and the Spirited Child. In a complete nutshell ( and I haven't read the whole book yet) he feels that child raised in a "child-centric" household - one in which the child is not told no, not required to assume responsibilities, not allowed to experience frustration or boredom - are not developing the tools and social skills to become responsible, empathetic, contributing members of society. I don't think asking a very young child to be quiet, for example, is always appropriate. While I agree with the basics (breastfeeding, slings, and even cosleeping) I don't think the child should be made to feel as if the world revolves around him or her. I listen empathetically to him when he crys or throws a tantrum, but I draw the line when he becomes manipulative (screaming to get his way) or inapropriate (hitting, being too loud in a public place...) I do not believe his methods create spoiled kid.</paragraph><paragraph parID="216">My parenting could be called attachment parenting because it resembles that over another style but I have mostly acted on intuition. She thought that I needed to let them have it and that at this age they need limits. I just try and calm them down and show them how they can communicate much more effectively by speaking clearly instead of screaming, throwing, hitting, etc. My MIL wanted to send him to the corner or the door until he was done with the fit. Is that better than saying I understand that you are upset? If I can not give my child what they want because there is a limit (i.e. a cookie before dinner) then if they continue to tamper I just repeat why they can't and tell them they have a right to their feelings. My desire (Dr. Sears or not) is to treat my kids compassionately while still giving them limits.</paragraph><paragraph parID="217">It is very difficult to consistently and constantly discipline our persistent, spirited child but I could not live with his behavior. I was so stressed by how out of control our house was I was getting depressed. I would like to find out if my husband and I are not the only ones who feel that his approach is passive and too touchy-feely and that it has ended up creating precocious children who are in control of their parents instead of the other way around. It seems like he is suggesting that we treat our children as if they are the center of the Universe, and that is just not realistic. We've read The Pregnancy Book, The Baby Book, and The Fussy Baby to help us understand our strong-willed child. These books were helpful as far as helping us get into the mind of our child to understand what she might be thinking or going through. HOWEVER, the down side is that I have become this overly understanding parent who is afraid to discipine for fear of doing the wrong thing, and as a consequence -- my 2 children (both under 4) are kind of 'running the show' here at our house.</paragraph><paragraph parID="218">At times we got to a point where both of us (my husband and I) were in some ways afraid to cross her, afraid to say no--we feared her tantrums, her ability to totally detroy a calm setting, be at home or out. We make it very clear what behaviors are and are not acceptable. There are so many issues at work here that I fear I'm not explaining the dynamic very well, but one central element to the problems in our household were (as I mentioned above) fear--fear of her tantrums and yelling and whining and also my own fear of the intensity of her emotions. I have tried to learn to hold her through them, to believe that I can indeed help her feel better. I too read Dr. Sears when my first one was born and tried baby-wearing and it hurt my lower back so I stopped, loved sleeping with my baby for the first 6 months and then decided I'd had enough of "sleep sharing", and needed a good night's sleep so did the "cry it out" technique with my toddler. It also helps to be the kind of parent who gets off the couch/stops the car/leaves the restaurant and/or physically removes the child if they are screaming/kicking/hitting because kids really want to know where the boundary is, will test it, and expect you to discipline them when they act up. Don't take any guff.</paragraph><paragraph parID="219">Stand your ground. Please don't be so hard on yourself! But we have rejected and/or tailored other parts to better fit our lives and temperments (e.g., our toddler sleeps in his own bed, etc.). I think it's important to note that childrens' temperments differ vastly, and Sears' philosophy isn't right for every child or every family. Also, keep talking to other parents to see what works best for children with different temperments. So listen to your own inner voice and set the limits you need to set to feel comfortable. The important thing is to not let someone else determine how you raise your child, you are the one doing it and no book has all the answers.</paragraph><paragraph parID="220">Dr. Sears does not say children should not have manners, or be well-behaved - just that both parent and child understand what those things mean and how to achieve them. After reading a few of those books, I've found that it's important not to let the pendulum swing too far on either the developmental or the disciplinary end. I've picked up a few skills and now feel less guilty when I enforce rules and boundaries, really let my 5-year-old know it's important to follow rules and keep boundaries. Many parenting experts say that children are happier and more secure when they know clearly where the rules and boundaries are. My understanding of it is that it encourages you to understand your children so that you can better guide them. For example, with the screaming, perhaps a (softly spoken) reprimand such as "I can't help you when you're screaming," repeated often enough will sink in. And according to a preshool teacher friend of mine her students are way more precocious these days... So what to do.</paragraph><paragraph parID="221">So we tried the CIO and although our baby didn't sleep through the night right away, he certainly started sleeping better and eventually did sleep through the night. Our baby was happier during the day and so was I. My very laid back parents have also made comments about how we jump at every command our baby makes and I keep wondering if we are going to pay for this in the future. I am now trying to take a good look at how we react to our baby's needs/wants and teach words/phrases such as 'wait' 'later' 'mama is busy right now' 'play on your own' etc. My 8yr old ds sounds alot like your Ava. I do use a schedule with him...it is not strictly structured throughout the day in the sense that I have every half hour of every day scheduled, but there is a morning routine, evening routine, etc. By having things scheduled, it tends to cut down on arguments. It is hard for him to argue with me about a written schedule.</paragraph><paragraph parID="222">They follow the same general routine as my 8yr old, but are not nearly as argumentative as he can sometimes be. Well, I always thought that if I had one "spirited" child the next one would be much easier Then we had Stephanie- the happier version of Ava, but just as stubborn! My other kids don't have as much of a need for a written schedule. Today she was playing with some children and I told her we were leaving in five minutes- to which she responded, "Mo-om! I'm playing with my friends! Okay?!" It's a good thing I have Ava to work out my mistakes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="223">I even made a chore chart for stephanie today...she wants to be just like her big sister. I figure we'll start earlier on her! I want to start very simply and see how we do...getting her to do *anything* is a chore for me. I was using the books/toys as an example. If tell her it's time to get ready for bed i assume she is going to brush her teeth- no way! She'll say she forgot or that she doesn't have to because she did it after lunch. She wants to do what she wants to do when she wants to do it.</paragraph><paragraph parID="224">I'm hoping that she will get these simpletasks to become routine so I can move forward. It's challenging to parent two girls who adore each other when the older one gets torn apart with jealousy over every little thing. It's hard to make her understand that she only punishes herself in the process. This week there has been a lot of negative buzz  going on about a writer for  Vogue magazine  who reacted to her 7 year-old daughter's obesity by placing her on an unforgiving, calorie-counting diet. I think choir means making friends, learning new musical skills, meeting goals, having a good time, and perfecting every day skills. Choir is really a wonderful opportunity. - Ellie Overman , age 11, grade 5, first year Treble Choir</paragraph><paragraph parID="225">The money provided made our musical dreams for my daughter a reality. Ms. White picks really diverse, beautiful, and fun songs, and she encourages us to learn more about the music. She expects a lot from us, and has a way of bringing out the very best in us. - Anonymous chorister , 12 years old, 6th grade, 1st year Concert Choir My daughter has gained confidence in her singing, and Ms. White's affirmation of the children is quite powerful to witness. They strongly desire to please her, and she, in turn, rewards their discipline and dedication with praise well deserved, and they all share in the joy of the music they make together. It is an incredible team effort, as I watch my daughter faithfully practice four times a week.</paragraph><paragraph parID="226">She is growing up before my very eyes, and I think this program has that unique ability to come alongside parents, and offer a great reason for students to work hard, be disciplined, and endeavor to do their best. I think being a part of something that is bigger than you is a wonderful experience to have while still a kid, and SVCC offers each student there a chance to sound fuller, richer and more magnificent than they could ever sound on their own-It's a gift given to them. " - Anonymous parent , 1st year And it still is something parents instinctively know is good for their children. Discipline, by and large, is not complicated. Some experts proclaim that really savvy parents shouldn't have to discipline much. They can talk and reason children into cooperating instead.</paragraph><paragraph parID="227">Some might say the only good discipline is an old-fashioned spanking. Others would define discipline as teaching. More than anyone else, you know what's best for your child. How do you discipline when the younger one is the bully, and has a very demanding personality. She throws tantrums when disciplined while the older one listens, and I discipline them in the same way. I have to threaten, punish, or spank before they listen, and they are constantly fighting. Sometimes she needs protection but sometimes she needs limits to protect her from hurting others.</paragraph><paragraph parID="228">You will need to find new discipline strategies for this high-energy, independent little girl. Lastly, try not to compare your children. Even though they are very different from each other, you do not want them thinking this is a competition for your attention or for your affection. If you control a phone, an activity that he wants to do, money that he wants for entertainment, these things are all tools that you can use to manipulate him into cooperating. Ask uncles, grandfathers, older cousins, school counselors, therapists, coaches and even other fathers to spend quality time with him. Find ways to keep him spending time with healthy people, and do what you can to keep him from communicating with the gang. What he wants is to belong and to feel like he has some control in his life.</paragraph><paragraph parID="229">You can't give him everything, but you can point him in the right direction. My children have no focus. My wife and I often resort to yelling in order for our children to follow our instructions. She is openly defiant, and she is putting herself in very scary situations. I just discovered that she is sexually active. She disappears for hours, sometimes even days at a time. She has even started making up extensive lies.</paragraph><paragraph parID="230">My 12 year-old son has bipolar disorder, is defiant, doesn't follow rules or directions, gets angry easily and overall has numerous behavioral issues. I have tried rewards and consequences for good and bad behavior. He sees a psychiatrist and counselor regularly but he only seems to bet getting more out of control every day. I am a 51-year-old parent with a 9-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy. We hate doing this. Though our children are spoiled, they do not get everything they want. But there is no urgency to do what we ask of them.</paragraph><paragraph parID="231">What can we do? Parenting is both rewarding and challenging. You are right on track when you mention that your children are spoiled. "Spoiled" does not necessarily mean getting everything that you want. When children whine, argue to get their way, do not take no for an answer or get several warnings or chances before they do a requested chore, they appear disrespectful or ungrateful, thus spoiled. If they know Dad will repeat his request multiple times before the yelling starts or if they have not received immediate consequences in the past, they have learned to ignore adult directives. You and your wife can turn your situation around with time and a consistent, concerted effort.</paragraph><paragraph parID="232">First, you and your wife must agree on a parenting plan. Discipline is most effective when it comes from a united front, which means that you and your wife will be working together. Discipline is not just delivering a punishment - it is teaching: 1. Teach them what behaviors you expect; 2. Model that behavior for them, even practicing with them; 3. Tell them the consequence of not abiding by that behavior; and 4. Offer either a reward or punishment appropriate for the behavior that they display.</paragraph><paragraph parID="233">Have a family meeting at which you state the new house rules. Given your children's young ages, five minutes is long enough. Say something like this: "From now on when Mom and Dad call your name, this is what we want you to do:  1. Stop whatever you are doing. Look directly at us and listen. Repeat back what you need to do. Go do it."</paragraph><paragraph parID="234">Role-play a situation with them that is likely to occur in your house. If your son is playing a video game, for example, he will need to 1. Put the controller down. Look at you and listen. Say "You want me to turn the game off in two minutes." 4. Stop the game in two minutes.</paragraph><paragraph parID="235">If your children know ahead of time that they will lose a privilege if they fail to follow your plan, you most likely will have success. But this won't happen overnight. You must be consistent and patient. It took your children a long time to learn their poor listening skills. It will take a long time - a few months even - to  unlearn them. My 12-year-old daughter is totally out of control! Please help!</paragraph><paragraph parID="236">Keeping your daughter safe sounds like a difficult task and one that may require professional intervention. Increase the monitoring of her whereabouts so that you can accurately report to the police when she leaves your home without permission. Ultimately, you are responsible for her and her safety no matter where she is. If you don't know where she is, then reporting that to the police is the responsible thing to do. The other suggestion we have is to get your daughter into counseling. There is something going on with her, and unless she can be redirected to follow the right path, she will only get herself into greater trouble. Sometimes her school counselor can be helpful, and there are also numerous counselors available in nearly all communities.</paragraph><paragraph parID="237">Many times these counselors charge according to the client's ability to pay. If this behavior continues to the point where you feel she requires a higher level of care than you can provide in your home and family, a residential treatment program may be appropriate. But the program leaders will want to know that you have already tried other avenues. If you would like help in accessing services, counselors or out-of-home placements, let us know what city and state you are in and we can provide referrals. How can I help him? Parenting a child who requires extra care makes an already tough job that much more challenging. Children who are diagnosed early on in life with bipolar disorder face many challenges, as does their family.</paragraph><paragraph parID="238">It can be common for their disorder to change as they do. Changes in the disorder may require adjustments in medication of either type or dosage. We always encourage parents to be completely forthcoming with how the medications are going because it can have such an impact on the child's treatment. Have you recently had him evaluated? Sometimes other types of disorders will co exist with bipolar, which may better explain some of the behaviors he's been displaying. It can be overwhelming to think that his disorder might be in constant motion and some parents have found it helpful to keep a daily record that includes specific behaviors, eating patterns, medication status and sleeping patterns. Examine the record for patterns that might be developing.</paragraph><paragraph parID="239">We encourage you to consider family therapy if you haven't already done so. Sometimes parents caring for a child who needs more attention often put their own needs last. However, it's hard to care for someone else if you're not caring for yourself first. Continue with positive and negative consequences consistently to create a stable environment for your son. When your the teacher, it is your rules, not the childrens rules if your going to teach effectively. Come up with a general list of unacceptable behaviors AND a list of positive behaviors. Determine what you consider a suitable reaction for each item on the list.</paragraph><paragraph parID="240">Then share this with the children so they know what to expect. Remember that different reactions are needed for different aged children. For example, a good rule of thumb for time spent in "time out" is a minute for each year of the child's age. If it is, attempt to communicate with your ex and develop some planned compromises. Try and find a middle ground that you both can live with. This is a critique of the study by Straus, Sugarman, and Giles-Sims (1997) Spanking by Parents and Subsequent Antisocial Behavior of Children in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, and its implications for the broader topics of nonabusive spanking and parental discipline by Robert E. Larzelere. THE GOOD NEWS (for anti-spanking advocates): This is the first study that finds any detrimental child outcome of nonabusive or customary physical punishment by parents using a design that would not also tend to find detrimental outcomes of most alternative discipline responses (or, for that matter, a wide variety of other interventions, including marital therapy, psychotherapy, or cancer treatment).</paragraph><paragraph parID="241">Age: 2 to 6 years How: 2 open-handed swats to the buttocks, leaving no bruise How: Primarily as back-up for less aversive discipline responses (e.g., reasoning and time out). The effects of nonabusive spanking have to be considered in the context of the effects of alternative discipline responses and the broader parenting context. The effectiveness of the most typically recommended alternatives depend on being backed up by more aversive discipline tactics such as spanking. This is consistent with my research and Mark Roberts's in that the most positive use of a nonabusive spanking with 2- to 6 year-olds is to back up less aversive discipline tactics so that they become sufficient and effective by themselves as the child gets older. As Gunnoe &amp;amp; Mariner and Patterson have noted in 1997, there is a lot about parental discipline that we do not understand adequately yet. THE BAD NEWS: The only thing that Straus et al. (1997) have proven is that spanking 6- to 9-year-olds at the rate of 156 times a year has a small, but detrimental effect (accounting for 1.3% of subsequent variation in anti-social behavior). Instead, their results are consistent with Larzelere's (1996) review, which reported that spanking 6- to 9-year-olds once a week was more detrimental than was less frequent spanking.</paragraph><paragraph parID="242">I would like to see a pairings comparison between the subsequent levels of antisocial behavior comparing those spanked 0 vs. 1 and between those spanked 1 vs. 2 times per week.The review found 8 studies that, like Straus et al. (1997), distinguished parental effects on children from the opposite causal direction.Thus the evidence to date suggests that nonabusive spanking has generally beneficial effects on children under the following limited conditions at least:Basically they find that the effects of spanking vary from significantly beneficial effects to significantly detrimental effects according to four factors: Age, sex, race, and marital status.At one extreme, spanking frequency increases the subsequent level of antisocial aggression for 8- to 11-year-old white sons of single mothers.At the other extreme, spanking frequency decreases the subsequent level of antisocial aggression for 4- to 7-year-old Black daughters in intact families.The three are unanimous that the effects are different by ethnic group and that the outcomes are generally beneficial to African-American children with the exception of those 6- to 9 year-olds spanked at the rate of 156 times a year (Straus et al., 1997; and Deater-Deckard et al., 1997, Devel Psych are the other two studies).</paragraph></documents>
